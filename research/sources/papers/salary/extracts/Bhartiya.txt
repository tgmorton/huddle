This paper empirically investigates the driving factors of hiring and compensation in the
NFL quarterback market in an attempt to study three fundamentally different objectives.
The first is to improve upon prior empirical results through methodological enhancements
to the actual compensation model. The second aim is to answer a series of market specific
questions with regard to the effect of free agency on NFL salaries. The third goal is to
generalize the behavioral implications of this investigation to other organizations through
ex-ante/ex-post analysis. The creation of a viable compensation model suggests that
compensation in the NFL QB market is a function of both performance-based and non-
performance-related variables and that the value of these variables decays over time.
Moreover, the inclusion of free agency variables yields results contrary to common wisdom
and suggests that the true benefits of free agency are indirect. Finally, a behavioral
assessment of the predictability of performance suggests that NFL franchises, like many
other organizations, tend to overestimate their predictive abilities given that past
performance is often not a reliable indicator for future performance.

                                                    Introduction

         In any labor market, the ability for an employer to accurately value a potential hire is
critical.1 Employers in most industries typically conduct resume reviews and behavioral
interviews to better understand the qualifications of an applicant. By reviewing the past
experiences and qualifications of each applicant, the firm is better equipped to make a
decision as to future performance of an applicant. Moreover, such a review can enable a firm
to better determine the salary parameters of a potential hire by accurately valuing the
applicant’s contributions to the company in the future. The market price of an applicant is
estimated by combining the traits of an applicant with the value the firm has for each trait. In
its simplest form, a firm should decide to hire applicants if their value to the firm is greater
than the wage being demanded.

        The National Football League (NFL) represents a labor market in which such hiring
practices can be adequately evaluated. A study of the employment methods within the NFL,
particularly those involving quarterbacks (QBs), is interesting for three reasons. First, free
agency2 and the seemingly exorbitant salaries that players receive have come under increased
scrutiny by the media in recent years. A model that can shed light on such hiring practices
can potentially highlight the carriers of value and derive structure from a seemingly chaotic
market. Moreover, a comparison between ex-ante and ex-post compensation models will
better illustrate the mindset with which NFL franchises act. Such a task can be achieved by
comparing the determinants of salary prior to the hiring decision with the productive value
received from the hire in the future. One would expect that teams typically pay a quarterback
today for the associated value of his performance tomorrow. That is, the hiring and wage
determination process in the off-season should reflect the predictive capability teams have
over pricing a QB’s performance during the upcoming season.

        A second reason for undertaking such an investigation centers on the fact that the
structure of the NFL offers the unique opportunity for the econometrician to investigate a
largely performance-based market. Unlike most other labor markets, NFL teams are able to
see the past performance of a player with nearly perfect accuracy. As a result, one would
expect teams to generally place a high value on past performance. Before offering a player a
new contract, his statistics from prior seasons can be evaluated and priced.

       A third motivating factor for this paper is the existence of inherent value to both
teams and agents in developing a model that explains which quarterbacks are signed, and for
how much. Instead of relying upon a priori information and hearsay, the value of all QBs
can be estimated more systematically by using econometric techniques. By using such a
paradigm, a dollar value can be attached to each attribute or trait a player exhibits, and the
degree to which it is exhibited. The development of such a model will allow for greater

    Value can be loosely defined as helping a firm achieve its goals; be it revenues, victories, etc.

 Free agency is the opportunity for a player to receive salary offers from other franchises once his contract has
expired.

inquiry into the nature of the hiring process in the NFL and with regard to the degree of
rationality with which franchises act.

        This paper will lay the foundation for investigating the dynamics of the NFL
quarterback market by developing a comprehensive compensation model for veteran
quarterbacks3 from 1996-2002. As a result, the overarching aim of this paper is two-fold.
One, it is meant to provide a working blueprint for future analysis of the NFL and markets
similar to it. Understanding compensation in an arena where past performance is perfectly
observable and quantifiable may provide insight into other related or similarly structured
labor areas as well. Two, this investigation will utilize the developed models to answer a set
of wide-ranging inquiries into the nature of the NFL QB market. These inquiries can be
grouped as follows:

       •   How do NFL franchises truly value QB talent? Do they strictly use a statistical
           performance-based model or do they employ an augmented model with other non
           performance-based considerations?

       •   How does free agency affect salaries in the NFL? Is it a direct effect – i.e., a player
           must participate in free agency to benefit – or an indirect effect?

       •   How well does past performance predict future performance? Do NFL franchises
           realize the difference between past and future performance? Are highly paid QBs
           really worth it based upon their future performance?

         At the highest level, this study has three fundamentally different objectives. The first
is to improve upon prior empirical results through methodological enhancements to the actual
compensation model. The second aim is to answer a series of market specific questions with
regard to the affect of free agency on NFL salaries. The third goal of this study is to
generalize the behavioral implications of this investigation to other organizations through ex-
ante/ex-post analysis. In general, ex-ante compensation models can be thought to explain
what organizations are paying for in their hires. Conversely, ex-post compensation models
illustrate what organizations get in return for their money.

        For the purposes of clarity, this paper will be divided into five sections. The first
segment briefly overviews the reasoning for investigating the NFL QB market, reviews the
scope of prior sports-related labor market literature, and highlights the improvements of the
approach used in this analysis. The second piece presents the data and gives the reader a
better understanding of the underlying performance fundamentals within the NFL. The third
section systematically develops the compensation model by improving upon past
methodology. It is at this point that the framework for answering the primary inquiries of this
study is constructed. The fourth portion represents a discussion of the results. The fifth and
final part provides concluding remarks and suggestions for further research.

                                1.1 - Why Study NFL Quarterbacks?4

         This investigation into the nature of the NFL quarterback labor market is meant to
serve two purposes. The first aim of such an endeavor is to improve the learning capacity of
the chief actors within the NFL by bringing systematic analysis to a domain often ruled by
anecdotal evidence and cliché.5 A model that describes even a few of the determining
components of wages is valuable given the nature of the position’s compensation. Moreover,
while football is indeed a team sport, the quarterback is the most visible player of a franchise.
It is not uncommon to have the starting quarterback among the highest paid players of a team
and serve as a team captain. Thus, a data-driven paradigm that allows general managers
(GMs) to systematically price QBs is of considerable importance. A benchmark model could
be used to highlight outliers or those players who were significantly under or overpaid. Such
observations would serve to better calibrate the compensation expectations of both players
and franchises.

        The second reason for studying NFL QBs is more exploratory. From the point of
view of the researcher, understanding such exorbitant compensation figures in an arena
where past performance and skill sets are perfectly visible begs investigation. The
availability of player attributes and past performance characteristics lends itself to an
assessment of the quality of decision making by NFL executives. By building labor models
that rely upon empirical evidence, not only can one determine whether or not a player is
being “overpaid” but also whether he “pans out” over time.

                                1.2 – A Review of Related Literature

       While the specific techniques utilized in this paper may be unique, the basis for
examining the NFL labor market is based upon prior research. This section highlights the key
additions that several economists have made to the study of sports compensation models.
Moreover, by juxtaposition, a distinction between the methodologies and ambitions of this
paper and past work will be apparent and summarized in the ensuing section.

       In their study of the National Hockey League (NHL), J.C.H Jones and William Walsh
(1988) attempt to use econometric models to determine the impact of player skills, franchise
characteristics, and ethnic background on compensation. Using salary data from 1977-1978,
Jones and Walsh hope to determine whether it is the player (monopoly hypothesis) or the
4
 The models developed in this analysis are by no means meant to explain all the observed variation within the
NFL compensation structure. They serve only as guides for future research and provide insights into the minds
and motivations of players and executives alike.

  There are numerous factors for why the NFL labor market acts differently than most other industries. First, the
set of employers within the NFL is quite small. There are currently only 32 NFL teams. Moreover, each team
has a maximum number of players available for the final roster. Such an arrangement lends bargaining power to
franchises when negotiating with most players. Second, the NFL, like many sports leagues, oversees the hiring
practices of all franchises. This is primarily evident through the adaptation of a salary cap in 1993. Third, the
NFL and the NFL Player’s Association (NFLPA) have agreed to a dynamic minimum salary requirement for all
players. Fourth, the NFL employs complex rules with regard to free agency, signing bonuses, performance
bonuses, and re-structuring contracts. Thus, while the NFL may appear to act like many other markets at its
core, it is much more complex.


                                                       3
franchise (monopsony hypothesis) that wields greater power during contract negotiation.
Running regressions by position, the authors find that neither the monopoly nor the
monopsony hypothesis is overly evident for most positions. However, they find that hockey
forwards, the typical goal scoring and glamour-receiving players on a team, have some
monopoly power. In addition, Jones and Walsh corroborate prior sports research and
conclude that skills appear to be the prime determinant of player salaries.

       Jones and Walsh motivate their investigation by looking for discrimination in the
hiring process. While this paper has no such aim, the authors’ findings with regard to the
impact of skills and bargaining power on wage have larger implications for a study of NFL
quarterback salaries. The models developed in this paper will go beyond the usage of skills
and utilize actual past performance statistics as the basis for compensation. Ultimately,
employers are interested in the application of skill to produce output. In addition, the value
and negotiating power of high-quality quarterbacks is augmented with Jones and Walsh’s
findings and should be evident in the models constructed henceforth.

        Building upon earlier models similar to those employed by Jones and Walsh,
Lawrence Kahn (1992) uses data from the 1989 NFL season to examine the issue of racial
discrimination. Given the absence of free agency at the time, or the ability for players to
move from one franchise to another freely, the author hints at the increased likelihood of the
monopsony hypothesis. With regard to assessing the pervasive nature of racial
discrimination, the author prefers the sports industry, because unlike most other labor
markets, individual performance is controlled for. Employing an econometric model, Kahn
uses performance-related variables like games started, experience, and days injured to value
NFL players. He validates past findings and determines that there is a slight but insignificant
difference in compensation between races. More importantly, Kahn’s assessment of demand
factors suggests that the racial composition of the local market plays a role in determining the
wage of NFL players. That is, white players earn more in metropolitan areas with larger than
average percentages of whites than in other areas, and vice versa with blacks.

        Kahn’s investigation took place prior to free agency and consequently, his results will
vary from those of this study. The bargaining landscape and compensation levels in the NFL
may have shifted once free agency and the ability for talent to move freely became
commonplace. Indeed, the National Football League Players Association 2003 Salary Trends
publication states that the average salary in the NFL has been rising steadily since the advent
of free agency. As a result of such trends, little emphasis is placed on the demand
characteristics of the franchise in this investigation beyond the team’s performance the
previous season. Furthermore, the models developed in this paper will go beyond the
performance-related variables Kahn used, and directly address past performance.

        Closely related to Kahn’s article in methodology, Dennis Ahlburg and James
Dworkin (1991) attempt to answer whether it is player performance or experience, position,
and draft that truly determines compensation. Using data from 1982, the authors develop a
model based upon both performance and non-performance variables in which seniority plays
a key role in salary. They argue, however, that draft should be insignificant if it is only an
indicator for professional performance and should decline as a player ages. In the end,



                                               4
Ahlburg and Dworkin find that both player performance and non-performance-related
characteristics impact wage determination. Their models indicate that salary is significantly
related to seniority and draft round, and that career performance explains two to four times as
much of the variance as the previous season’s data.

       Like Kahn, Ahlburg and Dworkin examine the NFL prior to free agency and like
most studies in the field, they look at compensation across all positions. However, Ahlburg
and Dworkin’s methodology is robust and useful for the goals of this investigation. The
econometric distinction between career performance and previous season’s performance is a
technique that will be used in models developed in this paper. Likewise, the usage of both
performance characteristics and non-performance characteristics will also be employed.

        Eric Martin (1999) attempts to untangle the NFL market for quarterbacks using a
bilateral labor model. Like many other experts, Martin argues that a quarterback’s salary is a
function of both on-field performance and team-related variables. Martin stresses that
although the QB is the leader of the offense and receives more of the blame and credit than
he deserves, football is still a team game and that the talent around a player matters. Using
the salaries of 32 players from 1987-1993, the author develops an econometric model for
starting QBs consisting of three unique estimations implementing both performance and team
variables. Underlying much of the analysis is the assumption that players play to win and that
the amount of revenue a franchise generates is a function of winning. In the end, Martin
concludes that both past season and career performance are significant and that teams highly
value quarterbacks with a track record of winning.

         Martin’s investigation is one of the few that revolves solely about quarterbacks. And
while the author utilizes both performance characteristics and team-related variables, his
analysis is limited to only 32 starting quarterbacks. A robust model would include data on all
quarterbacks during the time period studied. Indeed, the models developed in this paper hope
to go a step further and illustrate the differences in quality and compensation among different
tiers of quarterback. A full understanding of the market for quarterbacks must encompass the
varying degree of value a player can bring to a team depending upon his designated role.

        Wallace Hendricks, Lawrence DeBrock, and Roger Koenker (2003) also analyze the
hiring process in the NFL. However, the authors take a novel approach and focus more on the
role of uncertainty on statistical discrimination. Seeking to better explain the linkage between
ex-ante hiring patterns and ex-post productivity, the researchers look to the NFL draft. Built
upon option value mathematical models, Hendricks et al. validate past research that suggests
“groups may be at a disadvantage when the reliability of the test instrument used to predict
their performance is less than the reliability of this instrument when it is used to predict a
competing group’s performance” (2003, p. 883). The end result is fewer individuals from the
disadvantaged group are selected. However, research indicates that employers should take on
the increased risk of the disadvantaged group if they can eliminate the poorer performers
prior to selection. In the NFL draft, the disadvantaged group consists of players from lesser
known colleges and athletic programs. The data show that players taken earlier in the draft
typically hail from better known football teams despite the fact that conditional upon




                                               5
selection in one of the early rounds, “disadvantaged” players have better careers. The
opposite is visible in the later rounds of the draft.

        The notions of uncertainty and ex-ante hiring versus ex-post productivity encompass
one of the objectives of this paper. In determining what attributes and performance
characteristics are truly valued by NFL franchises, an ex-ante model is developed. In
assessing the value of a player to his team in any given season, an ex-post model is
constructed. One of the central goals of this study is to better understand and explain how
NFL management deals with the uncertainty of signing QBs. Establishing whether GMs are
over-confident or under-confident in their predictive ability is a topic of great speculation.
More importantly, such results can be generalized from the sports arena to many other types
of decision-making.

                    1.3 – Improvements/Modifications in Methodology

        Building upon past empirical frameworks, this investigation will implement three
novel principles into the development of its compensation models. The first modification is
establishing a distinction between performance in the previous season and performance over
the length of a player’s career. By distinguishing between performance one season ago and
the aggregate performance prior to last season, the model establishes a “decay” factor into
the analysis. The uncoupling of past performance will enable further investigation into the
nature of “memory” with regard to NFL executives. Indeed, such a model will highlight
whether player compensation is driven by more recent statistics or by career performance.

        The second adjustment entails correcting for the selection problems almost all prior
work ignores. Unlike many other labor markets, the NFL QB market does not allow for all
talent to be signed to a contract. That is, despite the fact that many players may be willing to
sign with a team for a minimal amount, the nature of the NFL bargaining agreement and
team structure prohibits such a move. Such an arrangement leads to selection problems when
modeling for salary because the data lack completeness. For example, suppose that
quarterback X wishes to play in the league but is only valued at Y. Then, if the minimum
prevailing salary exceeds Y, quarterback X will not be signed. Consequently, the dependent
variable is censored.

        Such an arrangement is only exacerbated by that fact that a football team is comprised
of only 53 players. Any one team is not likely to have more than three quarterbacks on their
roster at any one time. Thus, despite the fact that hundreds of potential hires exist, only a
fixed number will get signed. To correct for this selection problem, this investigation will
utilize Tobit regressions in addition to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). However, a second
related but different selection problem occurs when quarterbacks leave the league yet are still
valued by franchises. To correct for this secondary selection problem, players who leave the
league are left in the consideration set.

       The third enhancement involves the development of two unique but connected
models – ex-ante and ex-post. The ex-ante model determines the value of the characteristics
that go into the hiring decision and encompasses both last season’s performance and career



                                               6
performance. The ex-post model ascertains the value, or lack thereof, a player brings to a
franchise in a given season. While the ex-ante model aims to establish the methodology by
which franchises sign QBs, the ex-post model examines whether the same methodology
bears fruit post signing. In this manner, we shall be able to determine whether or not past
performance is a suitable predictor for future performance.

                                   2.1 – A Basic Description of the Data

        This section reviews the performance statistics, performance-related attributes, and
team-related items utilized in the models developed in this study at a high level. The next
section will provide a more detailed look into the importance of each of the attributes and
their predicted influence on compensation.

        The bulk of the data were obtained from two resources. The statistical data were
acquired from www.stats.com. These data include all performance statistics for all
quarterbacks from 1976-2002. The salary data for QBs were collected from the web version
of the USA Today for 1996-2002. The baseline criterion for quarterbacks in this dataset is
that all were on a team roster sometime after 1992. In this manner, QBs are valued in the
labor market even after having left the league.6 For the purposes of our analysis, however, all
QBs in consideration have played more than five seasons in the NFL.7 Veteran QBs were
chosen to avoid the influence of the draft.8

         Table 1 shows the summary statistics for each season’s performance. Given the
structure of the dataset, each observation is a player year. Table 2 shows the same summary
statistics as Table 1 except aggregated over the length of a player’s career. This aggregation
occurs every season such that for example, a seven-year veteran’s career statistics in his
second season in the NFL is the combination of his first two seasons’ performance. Table 3
summarizes the performance-related characteristics and player attributes in the data.
Information on whether a player was a free agent in the prior off-season and his height and
weight are captured here. Some of these variables are listed on a yearly basis and others are
also aggregated over a player’s career. Table 4 is a summary of the adjusted salary data from
1996 to 2002.9

       In addition, data are available or were constructed for the following: whether or not a
player was on a roster the previous season, the franchise for which a player played with in a
given year, the year he was drafted or first observed in the league, the percent of the total
offense a player represented, the length of time a player has been with his current team,
whether or not a player is playing for a new team, and a team’s winning percentage in a

    A number of quarterbacks return to the league after missing a year or two.
7
 It should be noted that for the purposes of the ensuing OLS regressions, we restrict our consideration set to
QBs with salary. This restriction is lifted for Tobit regressions.

 Empirical evidence suggests a strong positive relationship between the earlier a player is draft and his first
contract.

model.

  Note the smaller number of observations for variables based upon pass attempts. This is because several QBs
never attempt a pass during the season and these variables are consequently incalculable.

NOTE: The variables are defined as follows: s_gs = the number of games started that
season; s_gp = the number of games played in that season; s_p_atts = the number of pass
attempts that seasonl; s_p_comp = the number of completed passes that season; s_p_yds =
the number of passing yards that season; s_p_tds = the number of touchdowns passed for that
season; s_ints = the number of interceptions thrown that season; s_r_atts = the number of

s_r_tds = the number of rushing touchdowns scored that season; s_fum = the number of

s_per_comp = the percentage of completed passes that season; s_per_yds = the yards gained
per attempted pass that season; s_per_tds = the number of touchdowns scored per attempted
pass that season; s_per_ints = the number of interceptions thrown per attempted pass that
season; s_rating = the quarterback rating that season.

        There are three key observations from the season performance summary table. One,
given the distribution of games started, full-time starting quarterbacks in the NFL are
somewhat rare. Only a small fraction of players start all 16 games in a season adding value to
those players who do. Two, based upon the distribution of rushing yards, many QBs are
rather immobile and do not gain many yards running the ball. It is quite possible that most
teams dismiss the running capabilities of a quarterback as inconsequential to his overall
ability. Three, Pro Bowl seasons are infrequent occurrences in the data potentially adding
value to those players named all-stars.

NOTE: The variables are defined exactly as above except over a player’s career to that point
in time. Thus, the further along in a player’s career that these variables are looked at, the
larger these values become. In addition, c_bowl is the total number of Pro Bowls a player has
been to while c_per_bowl is that total divided by the number of seasons that player has been
in the league.

         There are three notable observations from the career performance summary table.
First, the significantly different distributions of games started and games played indicate that
many more quarterbacks come off the bench and play than start any given game. Second, the
nature of the career Pro Bowl variables suggests that players named to the Pro Bowl in any
given season are not guaranteed a return trip later in their career. Third, the high density of
career passer rating observations about the mean may suggest that QBs who are able to
achieve ratings greater than 85-90 can distinguish themselves from their more mundane
peers.

NOTE: The variables are defined as follows: draft_round = the round in which a player was
drafted; draft_pick = the pick within the round a player was drafter; draft_over~1 = the
overall draft pick of player; exp = the number of seasons a player has been in the NFL up to
that year; freeagent_~e = a dummy variable equaling 1 if the player signed a free agent
contract in the off-season; move = a dummy variable equaling 1 if the player moves to a new
franchise; tenure = the length of time a player has spent with the current team; ht = a player’s
height in inches; wt = a player’s weight in pounds.

        Three items are particularly striking in the summary table of player attributes. One,
quarterbacks are chosen with high frequency in all rounds of the draft despite their relatively
greater importance to the team. Two, most QBs move from team to team over the length of
their career with regularity. It may be determined that those players who remain with a given
franchise for a longer period of time are somehow valued higher than those who do not. We
shall return to this issue below. Three, the distribution of height indicates that most
quarterbacks fall into a pre-conceived range of 6’ 2” to 6’ 5”. It could be that there is a pre-
screening process that takes place in college or earlier that limits shorter players from
pursuing the quarterback position.

The salary data summarized below pertains to the set of quarterbacks who were on a roster
after 1992. All quarterbacks, not only those with greater than 5 years of experience are

        As expected, the distributions of adjusted salary from the summary table have
essentially the same means. However, the overall distribution of compensation seems to be
changing slightly over time. The increasing standard deviation from 1996 to 2002 suggests
greater variation in the contracts players are signing. The increased diffusion in
compensation may be occurring because of two reasons. First, teams may have devised a
method to better calibrate player value in more recent years and distinguish between
marginally different prospects. Second, as free agency became a greater and more important
part of the hiring process, the dichotomy between those players who reach the free agent
market and those who do not has widened.

                      2.2 – Performance Assessment and Predicted Influence

        This section will break down the compensation driving factors into three categories –
direct performance statistics, performance-related variables, and other attributes. Tables 1
and 2 from the previous section represent the set of direct performance statistics. Table 3
captures performance-related variables and other important attributes. The primary function
of this section is to acclimate those unfamiliar with the NFL with the basics of quarterback
performance. However, an understanding of the predicted impact these variables have on
compensation will underlie the consequent models. These predictions are provided within the
parentheses following each variable.

Direct Performance Metrics:
       The impact of these performance variables is directly related to value. It can be
argued that past performance is a strong indicator of future performance and prior research
suggests that teams are likely to use past performance measures when determining a player’s
value and compensation level. The magnitude of these traits is perhaps the most significant
aspect of salary determination.

       •   Passing yards (positive relationship) – The accumulation of yardage is perhaps the
           second most important aspect to offense in the NFL. The ability for a QB to move his
           team up and down the field in order to get into scoring position is highly valued.

       •   TDs passes (positive relationship), TDs scored (positive relationship) –The ability for
           a QB to not only move his team offensively but also score is important. Touchdowns-
           scored is a more encompassing measure that takes into account touchdowns thrown
           and ran for.11

       •   Interceptions thrown (negative relationship), fumbles (negative relationship) – One of
           the ways a QB can stifle his offense is by turning the ball over to the other team.
           Interceptions are generally the most common and tangible way this can happen.
           Fumbles are a secondary way for a quarterback to lose possession. The market will
           devalue a quarterback with a higher propensity to throw interceptions or fumble.

       •   Completions (positive relationship), completion percentage (positive relationship) –
           Completions and completion percentage are characteristics indicative of the
           efficiency with which a player produces. As such, teams seeking systematic
           production desire such traits.

       •   QB rating (positive relationship)- The QB rating is a highly visible composite of
           several factors including those listed above. Used widely as the first line of
           comparison between quarterbacks, the rating serves as an indicator of aggregate QB
           performance.

Performance-related Indicators:

11
     The vast majority of touchdowns scored by quarterbacks are passing touchdowns.


                                                       12
       While not identical to performance traits, these related variables measure the success
a QB has had during his career either directly or indirectly. While these traits are seemingly
not as important as performance, one would expect that a player’s longevity, winning
percentage, and national recognition to positively affect his salary.

     •   Victories (positive relationship), winning percentage (positive relationship) – Given
         that winning is the primary aim of all sports franchises, the ability to hire a proven
         winner is tantamount. A QBs winning percentage may also serve as a proxy for
         leadership ability, an attribute requisite for the leader of an offense.

     •   Number of starts (positive relationship), number of games played in (positive
         relationship) – Unless signed only to serve as a backup or mentor, most QBs are paid
         to produce on the field. The number of starts and games played in are good indicators
         of the talent level a player brings to a team.

     •   Experience (changes from positive to negative over time)12 – As with most labor
         markets, those players who have spent several years in the league can rely upon their
         past experiences to assist them going forward. Experience may also serve as a proxy
         for intangible assets like leadership, maturity, and dedication.

     •   Pro Bowl selections (positive relationship) – Each year six quarterbacks are selected
         to the Pro Bowl. Fans, coaches, and GMs conduct voting for the Pro Bowl and those
         players selected are typically thought to be the best at their position. Consequently, a
         high value is placed upon past Pro Bowl selections.

Other Attributes:
       Beyond performance statistics and related variables, there may be other signals in the
market that affect compensation. Justifiable or not, these variables tend to center on the
“labels” a player receives throughout the length of his career.

     •   Position taken in the draft (no discernible prediction) – While past literature suggests
         that draft is merely an indicator for performance in the NFL, there is some evidence
         that the influence of the draft persists throughout a player’s career. It is possible that
         the draft may pick up on some characteristics that performance measures do not.

     •   Becoming a free agent (negative relationship), moving to new team (negative
         relationship) – A central argument of this study is that players that are valued highly
         by their current teams will never reach free agency. Their contracts will be re-
         negotiated before other teams can make offers to them. Thus, the act of not resigning
         a player may serve as a signal to other potential hirers that this player is currently
         overpaid and potentially deficient in some area.




12
  Suggests the usage of both an experience and experience-squared term in the model. Such a notion is
supported by prior research.


                                                     13
       •   Tenure with current team (positive relationship) – Franchises may pay some premium
           for “firm specific knowledge.” Moreover, given the uncertainty of hiring that
           pervades much of the NFL, teams that retain talent may be willing to pay more for
           decreasing the associated hiring risk.13

                                          3.1 – The Baseline Model

        In order to simultaneously maximize both the reader’s understanding and the overall
viability of the compensation model for NFL QBs, we shall present its construction through a
series of additions or stages of development. This section shall formulate the baseline model
from which all deviations will follow. In line with the compensation models developed in
prior research, this model shall encompass mostly past performance statistics as well as
examine the influence of experience and draft on player wage. However, to be consistent
with the ex-ante/ex-post dichotomy uniquely developed in this investigation, the baseline
model developed will be based upon lagged statistics. That is, when examining the salary in
season t, we shall only consider performance and other pertinent variables from season t-1
and earlier.

        Regression 1 is an initial attempt at developing a baseline model through the
inclusion of all potentially significant performance statistics. All the variables in the
regression behave as predicted except for the experience and experience-squared terms,
which were predicted to have the opposite sign.14 The lagged number of games started over
the length of a QBs career is positively related to wage. Lagged completion percentage, yards
per pass attempt, and touchdowns per pass attempt are all also positive in compensation.
Lagged interceptions per pass attempt is negative in compensation as are lagged fumbles.
The influence of the draft on compensation is negligible. The key facet of this regression is
that the factors of QB rating are decomposed into independent regressors.15 However, given
the lack of significance on most of the decomposed variables, a more suitable model may use
the actual rating instead of the individual statistics as is done in Regression 2.

        Not surprisingly, the results of Regression 2 are superior to those of Regression 1.
The aggregation of statistics into lagged QB rating turns out to be significant at the 1%
significance level. Moreover, neither the economic interpretation of the other regressors and
nor their significance changes when QB rating is used. Thus, given the better overall results
of Regression 2, we shall proceed to the next section with it as our baseline model.

career-aggregated value of that variable at a given point in time for a single player.
Observations are included only if a player was on a roster after 1992, has salary for the years
13
  The role of free agency and the related market signals is an unexplored area in the much of the literature. Its
usage in this paper is based upon the research goals of this investigation.
14
     We shall overlook this unanticipated result until the complete model is developed.
15
  The quarterback rating is calculated using completion percentage, average yards gained per pass attempt, the
percentage of touchdown passes, and the percentage of interceptions.

                       3.2 – Improving the Methodology of the Model




                                              15
        There are two major modifications to the baseline model that enhance its overall
viability – the inclusion of performance statistic decay and the utilization of a Tobit model
instead of traditional OLS.16 A third, yet relatively minor addition to the baseline model is
the insertion of winning percentage. Such modifications are in line with the enhancements
sought for fulfilling the first major objective of this study. As mentioned, the second and
third major objectives of this investigation are to inquire into the impact of free agency on
compensation and to determine the predictive capability of hiring practices through the
construction and evaluation of ex-ante and ex-post models. These two major methodological
improvements of previous research should allow for more accurate inquiry into the nature of
free agency and facilitate the building of a better end model.

        The first modification will call for the specification of a model with both the previous
season’s statistics and career statistics lagged two seasons. By uncoupling performance from
the previous season (stats from t-1) from performance earlier in a player’s career (aggregate
stats up to t-2), it may be possible to better understand the decay structure embedded in the
ex-ante model. The magnitude and significance of these variables may suggest how far back
in time a GM is willing to venture in order to make the best hiring decision possible. It
should be noted that the relative importance of performance from the previous season and
career performance has been confounded in previous studies.

       Utilizing the decay assumption in the model significantly improves Regression 3.
When compared to the baseline model, Regression 3 can better explain the variance in the
data (R-squared of 0.48 versus 0.62). Again, with the exception of the experience and
experience-squared terms, all the variables - career lagged two seasons and the past season -
behave as predicted. Compensation is increasing in the number of career games started
lagged two seasons, career passer rating lagged two seasons, and the frequency of Pro Bowls
lagged two seasons. Conversely, compensation is decreasing in the number of career fumbles
lagged two seasons. As with lagged career statistics, compensation is positive in the number
of games started last season, last year’s passer rating, and making the Pro Bowl and negative
in fumbles. The impact of the draft is again negligible.

        In comparing the significance of lagged career performance with past season’s
performance, determining which set of statistics is more salient in compensation is not clear.
For both the number of games started and passer rating, last season’s statistics are more
significant. However, for fumbles and Pro Bowl, career statistics prevail. Such results are
consistent with prior findings and suggest that both past season’s performance and career
performance matter in the hiring decision. However, such results may lend credence to the
“recency effect” for actual statistics and the “label effect” for career stats. Since QB rating
and games started may serve to better predict direct performance next year, their more recent
values are more important. Conversely, since the Pro Bowl and fumbling are more
categorical by nature, their effects, for better or for worse, persist over time.

       The inclusion of career and season winning percentage has a strong impact on the
model. Based upon Regression 4, both variables are positively related to compensation with

16
  For a more encompassing overview of Tobit regressions, the reader is strongly urged to look in a basic
econometrics textbook like Gujurati’s Basic Econometrics.


                                                      16
career winning percentage significant at the 5 percent level. That said, the direction of
causality here is somewhat ambiguous. It is possible that winning quarterbacks are paid more
relative to losing ones because of the unstated characteristics they bring to the table. But it is
also plausible that winning franchises pay more for QBs given the importance of the position
to the on-field performance of the team. Further investigation into this question is needed.

       Regression 5 is essentially Regression 4 as a Tobit model. It is important to note that
since many of the quarterbacks now in the selection set did not play the previous season, the
past season’s QB rating and team winning percentage are removed from the model.
However, the addition of quarterbacks not previously on a team’s roster begs for the addition
of a did-not-play variable. Thus, Regression 6 includes a did-not-play variable among the
regressors, capturing the devaluation that occurs when a player is out of the league and
compensating for the loss of rating and winning percentage.

        The usage of a Tobit regression instead of OLS in Regression 6 yields some
fascinating results. First, the economic interpretation of the experience and experience-
squared terms flips and agrees with their previously predicted directions. Such a result can be
explained by examining the type of players excluded from the OLS regression. The OLS
model, which was conditional upon players receiving salary, did not capture players who
were no longer in the league because of their declining value in age. Thus, since the OLS
framework only included players who were on rosters, the marginal influence of experience
was positive.

        A second observation from the Tobit model is that many of the career performance
metrics lose their significance. Only winning percentage over a player’s career remains
important. A closely related third observation is that the significance of games started last
season and passer rating last season increases even while fumbles and Pro Bowl remain
insignificant. The driving force behind such a result is the increased role of the did-not-play
variable discussed above. It is import to note the large magnitude and high significance of the
did-not-play lagged variable in the Tobit model. With the inclusion of all quarterbacks and
not only those who were on a roster the prior season, greater weight is given to recent
performance. Because a significant number of quarterbacks that did not play the season
before are now valued under Tobit (note the increase in observations between Regression 4
and 6), those QBs that did play become more valuable. Conversely, those quarterbacks that
did not make a roster last year are seen as less valuable.

        The growing statistical dichotomy between quarterbacks who played last season and
those who did not places increasing weight on recent performance. Therefore, one may
conclude that the shifting importance of the performance variables when using a Tobit
regression signifies that GMs have a shorter memory than expected and are more interested
in performance last season than performance two or more seasons ago.

        With the aim of parsimony, Regression 7 is a pared-down version of Regression 6.
First, all of the career performance variables – games started, quarterback rating, fumbles,
and Pro Bowl - will be dropped from the regression given their declining importance. Career
winning percentage will be retained given its significance and economic meaning. Second,



                                               17
  the number of fumbles from last season, whether or not a player made the Pro Bowl, and last
  season’s winning percentage will also be removed given their relative insignificance. A last
  consideration (not shown here) is the usage of games played instead of games started to
  better capture performance. The end result is a model with all of its variables significant at
  the 5 percent level except for experience lagged, experience-squared lagged, and inverse
  draft.

                                    3.3 – The Impact of Free Agency

         Conventional wisdom suggests that the advent of free agency in the NFL in 1993 was
 quite beneficial for player compensation.17 Many believe that the ability to move from one
 team to another increases the negotiating power a player has, and thus leads to increased
 salary. Such a result is supported by the theory of labor mobility. Accordingly, one would
 expect the unconditional effect of free agency to be positive in compensation. The purpose of
 this section is to determine whether or not such conventional thought holds empirically
 through the development of compensation models that include free agent variables.

        This analysis of free agency and its impact on wage will systematically build from the
 very basic to a model encompassing the significant performance variables and non-
 performance traits used previously in Regression 7. In this manner, the general impact of
 free agency can be determined without conditioning for performance. For example,
 Regression 8 is a simple model that has only whether or not a player was on a roster the
 previous season and whether or not a player is in the first year of a free agent contract. In this
 model, the did-not-play variable is vital as it conditions for those players who are joining new
 teams because they were not in the league the previous year. Regression 8 suggests that being
 in the first year of a free agent contract negatively impacts compensation. While it is
 premature to speculate, such a result may hold because only marginal players reach the free
 agency market. A player that a team truly values typically has his contract extended or re-
 negotiated before he reaches the open market.

         Regression 9 bolsters the model and the developing hypothesis by including a
 variable representing whether or not a player moved to a new team in a given year. The
 negative coefficient suggests that players signing on with new teams receive less
 compensation. The unwillingness of a team to re-sign a quarterback may serve as a market
 signal for other teams to devalue the free agent. Regression 10 adds tenure, or the length of
 time a player has been with his current team to the model. The strong positive relationship
 tenure has with salary implies the importance of firm specific knowledge in the hiring
 process. The franchise benefits from retaining a known commodity and avoiding the
 associated uncertainty from hiring an outsider. In addition, the initial costs of training a
 player in order to create familiarity and establish a comfort level for interacting with a given
 coaching staff and front office is avoided.

          Regression 11 augments the model by including an interaction term between move
 and tenure. Building upon the rationale for why tenure is so important, the movement of a
 player who has spent several seasons with a respective franchise is probably an unfavorable
 signal in the open market. A player that is not re-signed by a team for which he has played
 for several seasons consecutively may not be worth signing in the free agent arena. However,
 given the relative insignificance of the coefficient, no such claim can be validated
 statistically.


 17
      The 2003 NFLPA omnibus on player salary trends highlights this notion.


                                                        19
         Finally, Regression 12 is the full compensation model with free agency variables
included. The weakening impact of these additional variables when regressed alongside
performance and performance-related statistics lends support to the hypothesis established
previously. If only those players who are not highly valued by their current teams reach the
free agent market, it is safe to assume that these free agents will have poorer performance
statistics relative to those players who never reach the open market. The decreasing
significance of the free agent variables in the face of past performance statistics validates this
argument. Players who reach the open market are not paid less because they are free agents,
but because their performance statistics are weaker than their non-free agent counterparts.
Free agency is simply an indicator of this poorer performance.

                            3.4 – Predicting Future Performance

        Much of the behavioral literature of the psychology of prediction focuses on the
notion that decision makers do not incorporate chance or statistical theory into their
predictions. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two experts in the field of behavioral
decision making, argue that many decision makers rely upon heuristics and other a priori
information to make predictions about future events. Kahneman and Tversky (1973) find that
the utilization of such techniques often leads to severe and systematic errors in prediction.
Thus, the purpose of this section is to analytically assess the predictive accuracy of NFL
franchises’ hiring practices. In order to accomplish this, we shall compare the results of an
ex-ante and an ex-post compensation model. In simplest terms, an ex-ante model reflects
those variables or attributes being paid for while an ex-post model illustrates the variables or
attributes received in the future.

        At the heart of the matter is the question of whether or not past performance is a good
indicator for future performance. Since it has been shown that NFL teams pay players for
past performance, it can be ascertained that they feel confident in the predictive capabilities
of performance. This hypothesis can be tested empirically by modeling compensation as a
function of strictly on-field performance variables.

         Regression 13 is the ex-ante model of compensation as a function of only
performance variables conditioning for experience. The model includes the four major
performance statistics of interest – games played, winning percentage, QB rating, and Pro
Bowl – from both last season and from a player’s career two seasons prior. The direction of
the coefficients on all of the variables is in line with the predictions made earlier. Teams
traditionally pay more for quarterbacks who have been on the field and have produced in the
past. In addition, the “recency effect” and “label effect” hypotheses established above seem
to prevail in the ex-ante model as well. The number of games played and a player’s QB
rating from last season have more significance than those career variables lagged two seasons
satisfying the recency claim for direct performance. Conversely, both a quarterback’s career
winning percentage and his Pro Bowl frequency lagged two seasons are more significant than
those variables last season are in the model. Given the categorical nature of both these
statistics, the label effect seems to hold.

        Regression 14 is the ex-post model of compensation as a function of performance that
season conditioning for experience. To maintain symmetry, this model also includes the four
major performance statistics of interest. The results are somewhat contrary to their predicted
values thereby strengthening the claim that franchises may be overconfident in their ability to
forecast performance into the future. The number of games played is significant and positive
in compensation as expected. The winning percentage variable is negative in compensation
in the ex-post model. While this result is contrary to its predicted direction, the variable is
difficult to interpret in its current form. A better variable would be the difference in winning
percentage this season from last season. In such a form, the realized gain from paying more
for a quarterback can be better estimated. The quarterback rating variable, while positive, is
insignificant suggesting that franchises do not realize the benefits of rating. Finally, Pro Bowl
with its positive relationship acts as predicted and is significant.

Table 8. Ex-Ante versus Ex-Post
The dependent variable is the log of the adjusted salary. For the Ex-ante model, each
observation represents either the player-year or career-aggregated value of that variable at a
given point in time conditional on a player playing the current season. For the Ex-post model,
each observation represents the current player-year value for that variable. Observations for
the both regressions include only players who were on a roster after 1992 and have more than
5 years of experience. * indicates significant at the p<.05, ** indicates significant at p<.01.

        Two observations are particularly interesting when comparing the ex-ante and ex-post
regressions. The first result worth noting is the differences in the direction and significance
of the coefficients between the ex-ante and ex-post models. If NFL franchises were able to
perfectly calibrate their hiring decisions, those variables on which teams pay (ex-ante) would
be the same variables that are evident when determining on-field production the following
season (ex-post). While NFL teams pay for games played, passer rating, winning percentage,
and Pro Bowls, only games played and Pro Bowl behave in the predicted manner.

         The reasoning behind the emerging disconnection between past and future
performance is either the function of structural causes within the NFL or implies that past
performance is a poorer indicator for future performance than expected. It is not surprising
that a team gets increasing playing time from a player with a higher wage. At the highest
level, it is the franchise itself that controls which players get playing time. The front office
can exert pressure on the coaching staff and push for the insertion of any player into the
lineup. Thus, the results of the ex-ante/ex-post comparison of the role of games played is as
expected; teams with higher salaried quarterbacks on their roster have a greater propensity to
put that player on the field over other less paid ones.

        On the face of it, the results of the above models with regard to Pro Bowl appearances
contradict the claim that past performance is indeed a poor predictor of future performance.
However, an argument similar to the one made for games played can explain why the
occurrence of Pro Bowl persists over time. While franchises themselves have no real power
in ensuring that any of their players return to the Pro Bowl in a given year, the nature of the
selection process lends itself to repeat all-stars. Given the infrequency of Pro Bowl
quarterbacks relative to all others at the position, the “label” value of being named to the Pro
Bowl is substantial. It has already been determined that the impact of past Pro Bowls is
significant on salary several seasons later. Thus, while the statistical performance of a
quarterback may not necessarily warrant his selection to the Pro Bowl, the fact that he was
selected last year works in a player’s favor. The ex-post model corroborates such an
explanation. In theory, Pro Bowl selection should be linked to a player’s passer rating and the
winning percentage of his team. Such theory is confounded by the fact that while past Pro
Bowls may predict future Pro Bowls, past QB rating and winning percentage have no such
discernible effect.

        The second key observation from the ex-ante/ex-post model comparison is the
disparity in the pseudo R-squared values. While the ex-ante model is far from ideal, the
inability of the ex-post model to explain even 15 percent of the variation supports the idea
that franchises are overconfident in their predictive abilities. The forecasting of on field
performance is much like that of mutual fund returns. The primary finding from this section
is that teams continue to pay quarterbacks as though past performance is an adequate
measure for future performance despite the empirical evidence that suggests that it is not.18

  The divergence between the ex-ante and ex-post models is much more apparent when the two are run using
OLS. While the coefficients and significance levels of all the variables remain similar to those in the Tobit
models, the R-squared values separate a great deal more (R-squared = 0.55 for ex-ante; R-squared = 0.23 for ex-
post).

                              4.1 – A Discussion of the Results

       The purpose of this section is to discuss the analysis’ results. However, in order to
systematically discuss the implications of the models developed in this study, this discussion
will be divided into the three main objectives of this paper, and proceed in the respective
order of their presentation.

        The first major result of this study is the value gained from the methodological
enhancements implemented throughout the model building process. The dual improvements
of incorporating decay into the model as well as the usage of a Tobit regression to avoid
selection problems proved to be beneficial. Future investigations into related markets should
encapsulate both these modifications into their analysis. Indeed, the nature of the hiring
process and its dependence upon past performance raises questions about the memory
capacity of hiring executives. Whether or not last season’s performance statistics are given
more weight than statistics from earlier on is a fundamental inquiry into the nature of the
NFL quarterback market. Moreover, the importance of uncoupling the most recent season’s
performance from career performance was magnified when the Tobit model was employed.

        Tobit models were utilized in this study to eliminate the significant selection
problems that pervade the NFL labor landscape. Given the existence of a salary cap and
minimum salary in the NFL along with the potential for players to leave the league and
return, the observed data are only part of the entire consideration set. By employing the Tobit
model in place of typical OLS, a great deal of importance was placed on whether or not a
quarterback was in the league the year before. Not surprisingly, teams significantly devalued
those quarterbacks who were left of the regular season roster in a past season the following
year. As a result of this devaluation, the usage of the Tobit model also gave greater relative
weight to recent performance over career performance.

       The second major set of results of this study is the implications it has for free agency
in the NFL. Conventional wisdom and basic economic theory would suggest that increased
labor mobility would enhance the wage prospects for players who reach the open market.
Based upon the analysis conducted in this investigation, free agency may indeed enhance
wage prospects in the NFL. However, the impact is indirect rather than direct with those
players who never reach the free agent benefiting much more than those who do. Such a
provocative result occurs primarily because those players who reach free agency perform
more poorly than those who re-negotiate their contracts before expiration. Thus, while the
conditional effects of free agency may be mixed, the unconditional impact is negative. The
moment a player becomes a free agent, his value is decreased because his current team
decided not to re-sign him before he gained access to the market.

      The third implication of this study revolves about the predictive capacity with which
NFL franchises make their hiring decisions. A comparison between ex-ante and ex-post
models suggests that NFL executives are overly reliant upon past performance in their



                                              25
prediction of future performance. In the two areas in which predictive accuracy was found -
games played and Pro Bowl - actual on-field performance is secondary to other
considerations. The franchise itself controls the number of games in which a player plays. In
order to recoup their lost wages, a franchise would seek to maximize the overall production
potential by providing as many opportunities as possible to a highly paid QB. Furthermore,
the selection process of the Pro Bowl is highly based upon past Pro Bowl selections and
independent of actual performance.19

        The inability of NFL franchises to accept and incorporate the lack of predictive power
past performance has on future performance can lead to an implicitly flawed compensation
system based upon unrealizable future productivity. However, such a phenomenon is not
limited to the hiring process in the NFL and can be generalized to many labor markets. While
hiring decisions are often based upon past performance and a candidate’s skill set,
organizations would be better served to understand the large degree of uncertainty that is
associated with future output and modify their compensation frameworks accordingly.

                                          5.1 – Concluding Remarks

        As stated in the introduction of this paper, the aim of this investigation was two-fold.
The first aim was to provide a working blueprint for future analysis into the NFL and related
markets. This study should represent one of many urging executives and front office
managers to utilize an empirically driven hiring system. The second aim was to address three
major objectives pertaining to and going beyond the NFL. Through the improvement of past
compensation methodology, market specific inquiry into the nature of free agency, and ex-
ante/ex-post performance analysis, this investigation opens up several avenues for future
research.

        Further research into the nature of the NFL QB market may take into account any of
the following four refinements. These refinements may serve as separate inquiries in their
own right but also would make the current analysis more robust. The first modification
revolves about the methodological change from OLS to Tobit regressions to correct for the
selection problems prevalent in the league. Future analysis using Tobit models should better
classify those players who did not play the previous season. As seen in the models developed
in this paper, the inclusion of such a variable precludes the usage of some season statistics. It
is advocated that a system that distinguishes between players who were not on a roster and
those who simply did not play during the season be created.

        A second improvement mentioned in the analytical portion of this paper involves
distinguishing between team winning percentage and a quarterback’s winning percentage. A
tangential modification is the creation of a variable that reflects the change in team winning
percentage from year to year. The inclusion of both these items would greatly enhance the
interpretation of results from the compensation models constructed. Given the great
importance sports franchises place on winning, the optimal hire would lead a team to an
improved record the following season. Moreover, researchers would be able to answer


19
     This potential for unwarranted autocorrelation in Pro Bowl selections lends itself to further research.

whether winning quarterbacks are paid more or if winning franchises pay more for their
quarterbacks.
        A third enhancement to the framework presented in this study would be to include a
categorical analysis of compensation. It is probable that NFL executives do not always
depend upon performance statistics in their hiring decisions. A more comprehensible
compensation system would categorize players into different bins and determine the value of
each of these bins to a franchise. For example, quarterbacks may be classified as either Pro
Bowlers, above average starters, below average starters, backups, or deep backups. By
calculating the value a team has for each of those categories and then examining a player’s
historical probabilities of falling into each of the categories, his overall value can be
ascertained. The difficulty with using categorical variables arises when attempting to include
decay in the regression. Weighting the importance of categorical performance over time is an
econometrically difficult task but is doable.

       A fourth and final consideration for studying the NFL labor market is conditioning
the value added of a single player on the performance of his teammates. Football is the
ultimate team game and a quarterback’s performance is highly dependent upon the quality of
his offensive line, wide receivers, and running backs. Numerous immensely talented
quarterbacks have performed poorly when surrounded by sub par talent. Conversely, many
marginal QBs have made a career by simply fulfilling a certain role within an offense loaded
with “weapons.” While an accurate determination of the expected role of a player is nearly
impossible to determine econometrically, conditioning upon the individual performance of a
QBs teammates may be a step in the right direction.
