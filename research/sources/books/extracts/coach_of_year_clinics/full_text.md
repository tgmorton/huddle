Florida State University

Thank you. A lot of city people have a little trouble understanding how I talk, but I can't help it. I hope all of you in here tonight are country boys. It is really good to be here. I've always enjoyed being part of a clinic. It seems strange for me to be up here talking. I feel I should be out where you are. There is so much football for me to learn. I hope I never get to the point where I think I know it all. If I do, I'll get out.

I can remember years ago when I was coaching in Alabama, every time we could get any information on a clinic, away we went. One of the things that makes coaching a great fraternity is that we are not afraid to share our ideas with each other, including the people we have to line up and play against. It is an honor for me to be here and be a part of the Nike Clinic. I know that the job Earl has done through the years has just been outstanding.

I started my college coaching career here in Kentucky. I worked for Roy Kidd at Eastern Kentucky University for a year in 1966. I coached for a year and a half in high school before Coach Bryant got me that job with Coach Kidd. I'm fortunate to have coached for that long in college. I learned a lot of football from Roy. I think he is one of the great coaches and great men of our profession. The first year I was coaching for Roy about killed me. My wife and I had just had a son. She thought I was supposed to help with rearing that little boy as she did. It didn't work that way. I was coaching offensive backs. We spent some long hours working.

I can remember the first time I went into the mountains to recruit. It was about Christmas time, and I had never been in that part of the country. There are not many mountains down in south Alabama. I was visiting a prospect. When I drove up to the house, there was a little nativity scene out in the yard. I really didn't understand everything that was there. It was a homemade deal; I guess they had made it themselves. When I got inside, I asked the boy what the three figures were outside. He told me they were the three wise men. The men were all dressed in red. I asked him why they were dressed in red. He said they were firemen. He told me that in the Bible it said, "They came from 
afar." 
I knew exactly what he was talking about, because that is the way we talk in south Alabama.

In the last 10 years I have been very fortunate to coach at Florida State. In the 90s we have been the most successful team in the country. We have lost 10 games and won 75. When something good happens, you need to find out why it did. If something bad happens, you better find out why. I think the biggest reason for our success is that we have had some great players. We have had some great recruiting years. We think we just had one this past year; only time will tell. The thing that impressed me was the way these players were willing to do the things to improve and become successful. We have had some great players come through FSU during those 10 years. We have also had some players with great ability who didn't become great players. They wouldn't get out of the comfort zone to push themselves to become great players.

We are in our off-season program now. We work at six o'clock in the morning two days a week. We have to get 10 days in before spring training. It is the 10 roughest days those guys will ever go through. It is that way by design. It is an old-time gut check for an hour. It is a time when we are trying to focus and put our guys into situations where they are going to fold or fight through it. That is the backbone, along with recruiting, that has led to our success. We work a tremendous amount on strength improvement, but at the same time we spend time working on speed and agility. We think movement is just as important as strength. We are trying to teach our kids to do things with great intensity and strict discipline. We want them to start, maintain, and finish their drills with great intensity. The thing we stress is 
never quit. 
The first thing Coach Bowden covers with the players who come to Florida State is this: "Don't ever quit."

In the 14 years that I've been at Florida State, we've lost four National Championships because we didn't finish. We couldn't finish the fourth quarter. I would be surprised if there was another team in the country that outworked us this year. We had the same thing come up this year in our bowl game. We were playing for a National Championship. We looked at the results and evaluated our play. I don't think there was anything wrong with our effort. We got outskilled, out-big played, outcoached, and outfought a few times. Those are the things you want to make sure don't happen very often if you plan on being successful. We may not be in the hunt for the championship next fall. We have to replace eight starters on defense. We had a very good defense this year. Our kids did a whale of a job of fighting back and getting pride back in our defense. We will be good on defense next year, but I don't know how quick it will be. We open up with Southern Cal next year at their place. We better be pretty good when we get there.

We have a lot to accomplish in our off-season, spring, and summer practices. I really believe this. It doesn't have anything to do with X's and O's. There is a place for that kind of thinking, but you better not depend on winning games against people who are as good as you are with physical talent. It takes more than that. The thing we are trying to accomplish in spring training is to win with good people who will give great effort, play with great fundamentals, and finish the game. We try not to get to caught up with X's and O's. You win championships in the off-season. From when you put the pads away until they come out again is when you win championships. That is when you work on the mental phases of the game. That is when you work on some critical things that have nothing to do with blocking and tackling. I'm going to show you our defense. The success we had was not the X's and O's. It was our players' attitude, character, will to prepare, and will to do the things we ask them to do. It is not easy for the coach or player. If your players will pay in the off-season, that's what helps you win on Saturday. That is where the fun comes in and makes it all worthwhile. I was recruiting this year in a high school in Florida. I saw this on a coach's bulletin board. I thought it was neat and applied to what we were trying to accomplish in our off-season. It was called "The Law of Survival": "Every morning the gazelle awakens knowing he has to outrun the fastest lion to survive. Every morning the lion wakes knowing he has to run faster than the slowest gazelle or he will starve. It doesn't make any difference whether you are a lion or a gazelle. When the sun comes up, you better be running." That kind of tells the story of our off-season program.

I don't think you have to get up at six in the morning to be successful. That is not the magic we've had at Florida State. The reason we started working at six in the morning was because of the players' academic requirements. We could have worked at night, but we felt the morning was better. It makes the players get up. Also, we have a lot of kids that play other sports, and this time doesn't interfere with their practice time. I have one kid that will be a starter on the baseball team as a freshman. We have six kids that run on the track team. They go through our off-season program in the mornings and the track practice in the afternoon. The morning time gives our kids an opportunity to play more than one sport. The only time that these guys miss off-season workouts is when they have a game. Every defensive back I've had has played baseball or run track.

After we get through with the bowl game every year, we sit down as a coaching staff and list some things that we want to accomplish next year. We sit down with our players and sell them on these things. The one thing we want to sell to the player is to become a champion. If our player develops a championship attitude, we won't have to worry about him. He won't be getting into trouble.

We set down four things as goals. When I first went to Florida State, they had only one goal: That was to win the National Championship. In the first five years the closest we got was about 60th. We weren't even close. We decided to set some goals that we could reach. By doing that, we could reach other goals. We are in a state where the National Championship has been won 5 times out of the last 10 years. Miami, Florida, and Florida State have played in many other National Championship games and have not won.

 





Page 7

Our first goal is to 
win our state championship. 
We are the only team that plays both the other teams. Miami and Florida don't play each other. If we can beat both of those teams, we have an opportunity to go for the National Championship most of the time. We were fortunate to beat both teams in the regular season this year. We have been in the ACC for five years. Our second goal is to 
win the ACC Championship. 
That is important because the winner of the ACC Championship automatically gets a New Year's Day Bowl Game. How you are ranked at the end of the year determines what type of bowl game you get. We have lost one conference game in five years. Our third goal s to 
win a New Year's Day Bowl. 
If you can play in and win a New Year's Day Bowl Game, you will end up in the top four or five in the country. We have finished in the top four for 10 years in a row.

Not every player we get is a good football player. But they have been winning for us. I had Deion Sanders there. He was not a great player. I am not saying that to get any credit for his success. Deion earned what he got. He is not the most-talented guy around; he is the hardest-working guy around. That is saying a lot, because we have had some great players over the years. Hard work is the key to success. I remember that back when I was at Alabama, I was not a great player. was one of the guys who was average that Coach Bryant took and made think he was a great player. Coach Bryant had that knack. I thought I was great, and because of that I played better than I should have. That is one of the things we try to do at FSU. If you can reach the guy who is an average player and make him raise his play to another level, you can be successful.

One of the best high school teams I've seen in the state of Georgia did not have a single guy taken off that team. Valdosta has been one of the most successful programs in the country. They must have won 20 State Championships. I was recruiting and asked the coach how he kept coming up with good teams. He told me hat he coached next year's team this year. I went back and thought a lot about that. That is the thing we do on defense. We play ever single guy we can get ready o play in a game. We try not to play a guy who is not eady. But if a guy can contribute, we try to get him in the game. If we can get him in the game, he is going to prepare better. If he prepares better, we are going to perform better. If he can make a play, he will push the guy playing ahead of him.

Our last goal is to 
win a National Championship. 
We have done that one time in 13 years. Coach Bowden has had two undefeated seasons and has lost in the bowl game for the National Championship. You are not going to win every time you get there. But if your guys keep fighting and getting in that situation, sometime it will fall your way. It has happened to us one time. The way our kids have worked in the off-season program, we will be back. It may not be next year, but we will be back. We'll play for it again, and if we don't screw them up, we'll win it.

We tell our kids that if they want to win the National Championship, they have to be 
dependable. 
They have to do what the coaches tell them. If they are supposed to play in the A gap, they better play it. There are no excuses for them not doing it. This applies to the offseason also. We can't make our guys go to the weight room or come to the off-season program. We don't try to. All we do when they miss is give them the opportunity to make up for what they missed, because we think their mama would want them to do that, and we don't want to let mama down. We want them to be on time and do their job the very best they can on every play. Bobby Knight made the final statement on this when he said you have to do it time after time after time. That is called 
consistency. 
You can't be great without consistency. You have to be 
productive. 
It doesn't matter whether you are on the field, in the weight room, in class, or in study hall. Jimmy Johnson probably gets as much out of this as any coach in the business. If they don't produce for him, they are someone else's problem. We can't do that. We have to find another way to motivate these guys. That is when coaching becomes difficult and the biggest challenge.

I've got a kid who started at strong safety for me this past year. He was a walk-on who started playing a little last year but broke his arm in the fifth game. He couldn't do any upper-body work. He worked on his lower body in the off-season program. The doctors

 





Page 8

cleared him for spring practice the day before we started. I really wanted to see whether he was going to play as if he had a broken arm or whether he would play like a football player. He played as if he wanted to be a football player. He was the most productive man I had in the secondary this season. I called him the "Trash Man." He scored three or four times on interception, fumbles, and blocked kicks. He was always there to pick the ball up and get in the end zone. He had tremendous vision. I remember visiting with the Dolphins' line coach when he was giving a lecture at Clemson. I asked him what he thought was the most important thing about a defensive player. He said 
vision. 
A lot of people talk about a linebacker having a nose for the ball. He doesn't have a nose for the ballhe has great vision. I got to thinking about it. I had never been around a great defensive player who didn't have good vision. An intangible that a player may have can allow him to be productive if he is strong enough at being dependable. We tell our guys that there is no place for excuses. George Washington Carver made the statement that 99 percent of the failures come from people who have learned the habit of making excuses. That is a strong statement, but it is true. We don't want excuses. We want results.

Attitude is 
a thing that can make a difference. Attitude controls how far you go. It controls you performance, preparation, and success. You have to have 
discipline. 
The problem we have is that the kids we get don't have a whole lot of self-discipline. They have to lean on us as coaches. We have to discipline them until they can do it for themselves. That is a difficult thing for most people. The last quality we look for is 
persistence. 
If you are lucky enough to get those three qualities in a person, he is going to be hard to beat, regardless of his speed or size. If you have enough people with those qualities, you are going to be hard to be beat. We are going to try to continue to do things in the off-season to coach those things. Any day we don't scrimmage, we end up on the goal line. Every one of those things comes out on the goal line. We tell our guys, "People don't score on you unless you let them." Every time we scrimmage in situations, we go 3rd and 3 and 4th and 1. Every time someone gets in our end zone, our defense runs a gasser after practice. It is not punishment, because all of them can do that without any effort. It is a matter of 
pride. 
That is the goal-line attitude you are trying to develop.

We have some defensive goals. We want to be the best defense there is in the state, conference, and nation. We have our objectives posted in our locker room, and each player gets a copy of them. This year we ranked number one in rushing, passing, and scoring defense in the state of Florida. In the conference we ranked number one in rushing, but we were number two in the other categories. In the nation we were number one in rushing defense. We were number six in passing defense. We gave up 229 total yards and 11 points a game. This is important for us and our kids to see.

We spend every penny we can to get better as coaches. We travel to other college programs and pro camps to study defenses and schemes. But that doesn't mean we are going to be better coaches next year. Maybe it can prevent us from going out there and doing some things that could prevent our kids from being the best they can be. Every time we recruit a defensive back, I ask him how good he wants to be. If he tells me he wants to be great, I'll try my best to make sure he gets there. Deion told me after his sophomore year that he wanted to be an All American and the best defensive back in America. I told him, all right, I was going to start coaching him like that. I didn't want him to start bitching and moaning at me when I was down his throat and pushing him. If you are a star, you will not be coached gently. When you tell them that and they tell you to do whatever it takes, an agreement has been reached. If they mean what they tell you, they will take the toughest coaching you can give them.

Our base defense is a 4-3. Ours is a little different from most 4-3 defenses. We play our defensive end about a yard wider than most defensive ends. We put them in a three-point stance and cock them in toward the inside. We tell them to get into the backfield as quickly as they can. We had one kid that ran 4.7 in the 40 but played like he ran 4.5. The other kid ran 4.5 and played like a 4.5. They weren't quite as big as most defensive ends. One was very athletic and skilled. The other was a hard-nosed country boy. One of them was a doctor's son, and the other was the son of a blue-collar worker.

 





Page 9

But both of them bought into the scheme that we were going to turn them loose to go to the ball. Their eyes lit up. We've been doing this for a number of years. We tell our two inside people to penetrate. We want them to move the line of scrimmage. Their aiming point is to get a foot behind the line of scrimmage. We want all backs to have to cut laterally. I don't have time to get into our block reaction. Basically, we are trying to take four guys and form a new line of scrimmage. At one time we played our linebackers five yards deep to attack the line of scrimmage. We went for a visit to Nebraska. We changed a lot of our thinking about the 4-3. A lot the things we do we got from Nebraska. Also, we went to Washington and Arizona. We tried to take different things people were doing and incorporate them into what we are doing. Don't take people and try to bend them into what you want to do. One of the best things you can do as a coach is to take your people and adjust your scheme to your people. Offensive people have been doing that for years. If they have a great option quarterback, they run the option. If he can drop-back pass, they do that. Don't put people into situations where they cannot be successful. Take what you have, and put them into the best situation for them.

We now use an "up call" to get our linebackers up to the line of scrimmage. We had three middle linebackers who had to be our linebacking corps last year. We put Bush in the middle and moved the other two to the outside. They were more effective playing up to the line of scrimmage, so we put them up there. I think both of those outside linebackers will make it into pro ball: one because he has great ability, and one because he has a big heart. They'll make it because it means enough to them. The middle linebacker we had this year was one of the smartest guys I've ever been around. I heard someone say that he was so smart that it was like trying to sneak daylight by a rooster. It just doesn't happen. I can tell from that reaction that most of you guys in here were raised in town. Most of you haven't heard that rooster early in the morning.

We started off as a quarter-quarter-half team in the secondary. After the fourth football game in 1993, we changed to quarter-quarter across the board. That was a good coverage for the personnel we had. This past year our personnel did not allow us to play zone coverage as well as we played man coverage. Therefore we played a little more man coverage last year. The main thing we wanted to do was get seven men up on the line of scrimmage and make the offensive linemen account for linebackers. If a linebacker is back deep, the offensive linemen are not worried about him blitzing. If he is up on the feet of the defensive line, they get worried. We tell our linebackers that they can run through anytime they want as long as they can make the play. Most linebackers want to blitz every play. But if he runs through and doesn't make the play, he is going to get his butt chewed out. We can't stand him making bad decisions, but by being on the line of scrimmage, he confuses a lot of blocking schemes.

These are the alignments we used. Our defensive end plays a wide 9 technique and has a 7-gap responsibility. The defensive end to the split end lines up in a wide 5 technique and has a 5-gap responsibility. All four linemen key the ball. We want them to get up as close to the line as they can. We got a bunch of off-sides calls this year. We were the most penalized team in the ACC this year. I'm not bragging because Coach Bowden says penalties are coaching mistakes. You eliminate penalties with good coaching. He's right because he is the boss. I don't believe you can be aggressive on defense and not get penalties. We got a lot of criticism against Florida for hitting late, but we got penalized twice for it. I don't want my defensive ends wondering whether the quarterback still has the ball or not. I want them coming hard, not holding back. If we've got a guy pinned against the sideline and the whistle hasn't blown, hit him. That back should not be running out of bounds. We don't teach dirty ball. Bobby Bowden doesn't, and he would fire anybody who did. But we do teach hard-nosed ball. As long as that guy has our ball, we are going to try to get it. It's all in how you look at it.

The tackle is in a 3 technique to the tight end and has a 3-gap responsibility. The nose guard is in a 2 eye on the guard to the split end side. He has the 1-gap-weak responsibility. Our linebacker aligns tight to the line. The strong linebacker is in a 7 technique on the tight end and has the 7-gap responsibility. The middle

 





Page 10

linebacker is in a 1 technique to the strong side and has the 1-gap-strong responsibility. The weak linebacker is in a 4 technique to the split end side and has the 3-gap responsibility. On the snap of the ball, if the linebacker is not running through, he takes a step back. He does that to let the linemen clear, and he can take a better angle to his gap. When we first looked at it, I didn't think we could do it. I didn't think I could coach a linebacker to back up when the ball was snapped. But it worked.

In our quarter-quarter coverage we are going to read the inside guys. If we get a vertical pattern from the inside people, we are in quarter zones deep. If we get anything else, the safeties become involved with underneath coverage. The bad thing about playing this coverage is that your linebackers end up being curl to flat players and they can get bogged down with fakes. Any coverage you put up is like a front. You are playing that coverage to gain a strength. The reason we like the quarter-quarter scheme is that we can get an eight-man front from a seven-man alignment. We can use one of our defensive backs as a hidden linebacker. We align our corners five yards deep and put the number-one receiver inside to his side. The free safety and rover are eight yards deep, keying the two man to their side.

Let me show you our support to the strong side. If the tight end blocks down or releases, the 9-technique end tightens down and swaps gaps with the strong linebacker. His responsibility is the 5 gap instead of the 7 gap. The Sam linebacker ends up outside the 9-technique end in his gap. If the tight end blocks out, we maintain our gaps. The middle and weak linebackers flow and leave the cutback to the rover.

You may not think that looks right, but it works. Our first objective is to stop the run. Unless you can whip everybody at the line of scrimmage, the best way to stop the run is to get an extra man that the offense can't block. That is why I don't like to play the quarter-quarter-half scheme. If your rover is a half player, he can't help on the run. The linebackers have to slow down, and the whole defense is in a bind. Plus one guy split out blocks two people: your corner and rover. In quarter-quarter our corners basically end up in man coverage. The underneath coverage is a route read by the free safety and rover. On the isolation weak we attack with the weak-side linebacker. He wrong-shoulders the blocker, and the rover flies up and makes the hit on the line of scrimmage. He may not keep him from gaining a yard, but he can make the hit on the line.

There are some problems you can get into when you are playing zone defense. We declare to the tight end. If an offense bring two receivers to the same side, we bring our corner over. We don't take our linebackers out of the box if we can help it. We want to match a corner on a wide out. There is very little adjustment. If the wide out motions, the corner goes with him. If he aligns over, the corner aligns over with him. It gives us cover guys on receivers. We play a lot of situation

 





Page 11

defenses. We play a 1st and 10 as a rundown and run our defense to fit the situation. We keep our linebackers committed to the box as long as we can. We like to play the quarter-quarter coverage because it allows us flexibility to match up talent with talent and still stop the run.

Gentlemen, it has been a pleasure to be here. If you are going to be in Tallahassee, drop by and see us. Just call ahead to make sure we are there. Thank you again.

University Of Oklahoma

Thank you, gentlemen. I would like to thank you for inviting me here. I know that a lot of time when we go to clinics we talk X's and O's. Football is much more than that. In this game you are dealing with kids. The first thing I'm going to talk to you about is philosophy. I'm going to talk about my philosophy and what I feel it's going to take to bring the University of Oklahoma back.

The fact is that there is no discipline in our schools any more. I give credit for the course of my life to my mom and dad. They instilled values in me. They led me into my beliefs and religion. Jesus Christ is the foundation of my success. The only one I have to please is God. I think we should thank God for being here today and for our opportunities. I am a young coach, and I know what it takes. I think the most important things that got me where I am today are my respect for people around me, my parents, and Jesus Christ.

I've got a wife and a nine-month-old baby boy that I thank God for every day. A great deal of my guidance came from my high school coach. Every coach in here had that time when they left mom and dad's influence. That was a big time in my life, because I turned to my high school coach, and he turned me toward God. All of you sitting out there can do the same thing. I thank God for the high school coaches. I know you don't make a lot of money, but it takes a special person to help the kids of today. I know what you go through. I thank you for the effort you show toward the kids and the patience you have with them. It's tough.

I came back to Oklahoma for one reason. I liked it in the NFL and could have stayed there. But I wanted to coach the young men at Oklahoma. They were struggling and needed somebody. I told the president that 90 percent of my time would be spent with the kids, not the X's and O's of football. These kids were under all kinds of pressure from their peers to take the wrong path. There is so much in our society that can lead our kids down the wrong road. Drugs, alcohol, stealing, and all different social ills are out there to prey on these kids. I want to get into the kids' hearts and minds.

There is not much difference between a good player and a great one. If you take a good player and discipline him, get him to lift weights, and get him to do what you say and if he is coachable, he can become a great player. A great player may be able to make the plays, but if you can't control him, he'll hurt you in the long run.

You can develop outstanding players. I've seen it in the NFL. The Dallas Cowboys are a tremendously talented team. But all it takes is one or two plays to decide whether you win or lose a football game. We blew out some people, but so many other times if Troy had not made a great pass or someone didn't make a block, we would have gotten beat.

I know the commitment it takes to be a professional football player. It takes discipline to play 60 minutes of football. On this level the players are paid to do a job. That is not the case in college or high school. I understand that. That is why my one goal is to take care of my players. Half of the meetings I have with my team are not about football. I talk to them about drugs and alcohol. I talk about being out late at night. I talk about who they hang out with and peer pressure. Those are the things I talk about with my players.

I love being at Oklahoma. I played there. I know what it takes, and I left the NFL for that reason. I came back to lead and protect these kids, and I hope Oklahoma gets back on top. I need your help. I know how important you are. I want to recognize you and help you in any way I can. Getting to college coaching is not about who knows the most. It is about opportunity.

 





Page 13

Anyone in this room could coach on the college level if given the opportunity. However, your commitment to high school coaching is a blessing for these kids.

At Oklahoma I had to put together a staff and start to build a program from one that has been down. Oklahoma has great tradition. To build back that tradition, you have to start with staff development. When you put together your staff, you have to have a number of things present within the people you hire. They must be committed to the things you are. They must be loyal to you and the school. They have to be accountable for their work. The players are looking to the coaches for examples. How can we tell a kid not to smoke when we smoke? Those kids are looking at us and mimicking us. What do you want to be remembered for? Do you want to be remembered as someone who influenced the lives of their kids or someone who just won games? I want to be remembered for making a difference in these kids' lives.

Today in college football we have to emphasize academics. Academics will be the number-one priority at Oklahoma. We have an academic support system which sets up study halls, monitors class attendance, and grades. If a kid assigned to that study hall misses, he reports to the stadium at 5:30 in the morning. He has to run. We are going to focus on the direction these kids go.

I put together an outstanding staff with a lot of high morals and values. I got one of John Cooper's coordinators, Bill Young, who had been with him 18 years. He took the same job at Oklahoma. He saw the direction our program was going.

You must have loyalty within your staff. If you don't, it will turn your program inside out. Most programs and jobs are lost because someone from inside the program destroyed it. If you have a situation where one of your assistants has a friend who doesn't like the way you un your program, that is not disloyalty. But if that friend starts to talk about the program and his boss and the assistant won't defend the program, that is disloyalty.

I'm going to talk about the 4-3 defense in just a minute. We'll talk about the alignments, linebacker play, and coverages. That is the type of football you want to hear. Just remember guys, it is not what you run, but who is running it on the field. It is the talent and not the scheme that wins. It is developing the talent with the proper thinking that wins games. Discipline and commitment are tremendously important. Kids have to believe that you care about them and love them. We had a team this year that wasn't that good, but they never gave up. We played 60 minutes of football even when the game was out of reach. That was because our kids knew that we cared about them. These kids were loyal and would fight to get the job done for the coaches. They all know how to line up and play football. That is why you have to reach them to get them to play to the highest level they can. That goes for pros as well as college.

We played a 50 defense at Oklahoma for 12 years. When we went to the Cowboys, we went to the 4-3 defense. At Oklahoma when I was playing, we played the 4-3 in a nickel situation. But for the most part, teams in the Big Eight ran the football. They did not throw the ball all that much. But today the 4-3 defense allows you to balance across the front and secondary. The 4-3 defense is an attacking defense. We teach our guys to attack and react. We get as close to the ball as we can and come off the ball. In our alignment we want the inside hand down. The inside hand is the one closest to the ball. We want our inside leg back. The reason for that is to squeeze the play and not get turned out. That is the hardest technique to play. As the defensive lineman steps with his inside foot, he is creating power in his punch hand where he can squeeze the slip block. The guard is trying to butt up and slip to the backside linebacker. By using that type of charge, the defensive tackle can defeat the reach, squeeze, and slip and maintain control of the B gap.

In a 4-3 defense if you bring a defensive tackle into a 2 technique on the guard, make sure he has A gap responsibility. That way you keep your linebacker clean.

Let's talk about alignment. The end to the 5 technique side is inside ear hole to outside ear hole of the

 





Page 14

offensive tackle. That is generally the short side of the field. If he gets a weak set by the back, he widens to keep from getting cut off. The 3 technique is lined up ear hole to ear hole on the guard no matter what happens. He does not worry about getting reached. A 2 technique is outside ear hole to inside ear hole of the guard. The 4 technique is the same thing except on the tackle.

We play a 7, 6, and 9 technique on the tight end. On all of these techniques we are playing ear hole to ear hole. We do not ever want to be cut off and turned out. Players like Russell Maryland, Leon Lett, and Charles Haley never get reached. A player who gets reached is late coming off the ball. He is reading and not attacking. When he comes off the ball and attacks the blocker, he is in an attacking and power position. I want to lock up and drive the offensive blocker back off the line of scrimmage. After he starts to drive the offensive blocker back, he starts to maintain his gap responsibility. The mistake a lot of guys make is jumping outside when they see the reach drive block. When they do that, the blocker seats his block and drives the defense outside. The key to this technique is to get off the ball.

A type of attacking technique can get the defensive tackle upfield too far on some occasions. That makes him vulnerable to the draw-and-trap play. We work hard on down and distance to give our people a chance to think about what is coming.

We work on recognizing blocking schemes. Make your people complete football players. Make them think about down and distance so they are ready for the draw and trap. As our defensive linemen come off the line of scrimmage, they recognize the set and hand position of the offensive linemen. When they read the draw set, they start to squeeze to the inside. We don't want them to stop their charge, because if it is a playaction pass, it is hard to restart the charge in the pass rush. If the offensive lineman pops straight up and stutter-steps, it is a run.

Our defensive linemen run games and stunts, and we never tip them off. If defensive linemen look at where they are going, they tip the stunt to the offense. Offensive linemen look for the tip-offs. Teach your defensive fronts not to look where they are going. Teach them not to stagger their feet the way they are going.

One stunt we like to run is called ''ET.'' The E stands for end, and the T for tackle. The end goes first, and the tackle comes around. It is generally a weak-side stunt. The end comes down and works to the backfield. He has to get his feet moving and keep them moving. He keeps going until he is deep into the backfield. If he stops his feet from moving, he can lose his balance and fall. The defensive end has to make the tackle take him. If he stops working his feet, the tackle will read the stunt and come off on the defensive tackle coming around. The tackle comes off on the guard and bull-rushes the guard. He doesn't start his move to the outside until he sees the end come down. Again, this stunt requires the defensive linemen to come off the ball hard.

In the 4-3 defense, never let the 3 technique play in just one spot. Move him around. Put him on the inside pinch, or formation game. Use linebacker and defensive-line stunts to free up their playing area. If the inside tackles don't make things happen on defense, the defense is in trouble. If they don't make plays, your Mike linebacker will not be effective. Move the down 2s and 3s around as much as you can. The easiest block for the offensive tackle is when he knows the defensive end will never come inside of him.

In the pass rush we teach our linemen about the 3-, 5-, and 7-steps drop. We have to know what the offense likes to do. If they are a 3-step-drop passing team, our stunts have to be quick and short so that we can get our hands up in the quarterback's face. This goes back to down and distance. That helps your players to execute the plays you want from them. It lets your

 





Page 15

linebackers make the proper drops. If the quarterback is running a 5-step drop, the defensive linemen can run a delayed stunt. Teach down and distance and pass drops in your philosophy.

If the offensive goes to two tight ends versus the 4-3 defense, most coverages are some kind of quarter coverage. Generally, we are in quarters all the way across. The corner has the wide receiver mostly in man coverage in the zone. If the receiver runs past 10 yards, the corner has him man to man. If the receiver climbs to 14 yards, he still is man. After that he is going to trade him to the safety. If he takes off, he lets him go. He is then reading flow and could be support on a run.

In the 4-3 defense versus a two-tight-end set, we will declare to the side we think you are going to run. That means we will play a 36 technique to the strong side and a 27 to the weak side. We declare our strong-side tackle to a 3 technique, which is outside eye of the guard, and the end in a 6 technique, which is head-up the tight end.

To the other side we play the tackle in a 2 technique, which is head-up the guard, and a 7 technique, which is inside eye of the other tight end. In the 4-3 defense there are a lot of holes or bubbles in the alignment. The inside tackles have to be studs. They have to be able to draw the double team. If the offense can handle your tackle with one guy, your defense is going to be weak. The tackles have to make the belly play bounce flat to the line and outside. For this type of offense to be successful, there have to be tight ends who like to block. In the 4-3 defense the safeties have to stay on top of the number-two receiver, who is the tight end.

The two-tight-end formation is a good formation to run against a 4-3 defense, if you have two good tight ends. The offense can make all kinds of adjustments with their personnel and cause the defense some problems with alignment. I like the 4-3 defense because it allows you at all times to run "run blitzes." That gives you the chance to get minus yards in pass situations or definite run situations. The 2nd and 2 is a waste down for the offense. The 3rd and 2 play is a run situation for the first down. These are situations where we like a "run blitz."

A lot of defensive coordinators would like to find one key that will put them in the right front. I'm going to give you some ideas about how to find those keys. When you scout a football team, find out from each formation what play they like to run. We like to run the "tight 5." That puts us in an overshift defense to the tight end. This gives us a 1 and a 5 technique to the split-end side. We are in a 3 and a 9 technique to the tight-end side. We move and jump or stem into those sets. The offense likes to come to the line and call their play. You want to get into a defense and then stem to the "tight 5."

If the offense comes out with a back strong, we can take the Sam linebacker, walk him up on the line outside the defensive end, and bring him. The defensive end takes an inside charge and covers the Sam linebacker's gap and the Sam linebacker takes the defensive end's responsibility. If the offense sets a back weak, the Will linebacker and 5-technique end can do the same thing.

 





Page 16

If the offense stays in an I formation or strong set, we can call "Mike scrape." That allows the Mike linebacker to run a stunt with the 3-technique tackle. The 3-technique tackle slants back into the 1 gap, and the Mike linebacker runs through the 3 gap.

The Mike linebacker makes the call off the offensive set. How many times have you broken the huddle and wished you had called another defense? Let Mike call the defense, and you have a chance to stop the play.

Last year we had a hard time stopping the run. We had to commit to an eight-man front and play cover one, man coverage, in the secondary. We call our eight-man adjustments "one-free." This means that at the last minute the Mike and Will linebackers are going to slide a little bit to the weak side. The end to the weak side would normally, on a running play, bounce the zone play. Since the free safety is gone and cannot support, the end has to box and contain to his side. He plays outside in and keeps the ball inside. When you check to man coverage, the end has a different responsibility.

You can kick the defense to the weak side and get the same eight-man front. We overshift the front to a 3-and-5 technique to the weak side and a 1-and-5 technique to the strong side. The Sam linebacker shifts up into a 9 technique. Mike and Will linebackers stack in the 3 and 1 gaps, and the strong safety walks up to the 7 technique on the tight end.

Defense is an attitude. But you have to practice that. In your philosophy you have to simplify the calls you are going to make. We want kids to be aggressive, not cautious. There are three phases of football. We have offense, defense, and the special teams. Set individual goals with your kids, especially on special teams. If you win in your special-teams play, you have a chance to win the football game. Special teams are a major factor in winning a football game. You have to emphasize that phase of the game.

I measure defense by no points on the board. I understand that teams kick field goals. But they have to drive to get into position to kick a field goal. Never give in to a situation. Try to make your guys play harder when they meet adverse situations and sudden changes. Defense wins championships. Offense wins games. Make sure you build your defense first.

We run the "pursuit drill" to improve our defensive team. The defensive coach gets in the middle of the field, calls the defense, and then watches his team react. We film this and make sure every kid gets the proper angle going in his pursuit responsibility. The kids are conditioning as well as learning. With everything that you do in football, try to make your guys think. They are sprinting, but there is a purpose to what they are doing. They have to think. It is a good drill because they are reacting to the takeoff, sprinting to the ball, and sprinting off the field.

Another drill we use with our defensive team is the "intercept drill." We call the defense and let the defense react with pass rush and coverage. We throw the ball downfield where a defensive back will intercept. He returns the ball, and everyone has to react to that side of the field, get in front of the ball, and escort it up the sideline.

We do the same things with our offense. We like upand-run goal-line drives. We huddle them, snap the

 





Page 17

ball, and run the plays. The offensive linemen sprint down field and escort the ball. That is conditioning with a purpose.

Gentlemen, we are going to do everything we can to help you. We have our football camp. If you come down, our coaches will take you into a room, sit down, and give you some football time. I don't mean just lecture. We want to help you become a good football coach.

Again, your main focus has to be your kids. You have to spend time with them and direct them. You can talk X's and O's all you want or draw plays until you are blue in the face, but if you don't have the kids' minds in the right direction, it won't work. Your focus should be spending time with the kids and making sure they are doing what is right. That is what we are about at Oklahoma.

Gentlemen, if you don't have any questions, I'll close. Just remember how important you are to your players. You are a big influence on what they do. Teach them to do the right things, and I'll promise you everything else will take care of itself. I appreciate your inviting me. Thank you.

Wayne Bolt

Setting the Offensive Practice Schedule

Troy State University

When Ray Lamb called me to speak, I told him I had four types of lectures. I told him I had a one hundred dollar, two hundred dollar, five hundred dollar, and one thousand dollar lecture that I could give. I asked him which one he want me to use. He said, "Wayne, I want you to lecture 
free." 
I said, "No way." But I am glad to be here.

For those who do not know much about Troy State, let me bring you up to date. We are located in south Alabama. We are a Division I AA football team. We are a member of the Southland Football League. We are about one hour below Auburn. We are about two hours from the beach. We have been pretty successful for the last six years. I work for Larry Blakeney, who was an assistant at Auburn for 13 years. We have put together a good program. Not only is it a good place to go to school and to get an education, but it is a place where we feel we can win some football games.

Today I want to go over what we do with our offense. First, I want to talk about our practice schedule. At a lot of the clinics you go to, they talk a lot of X's and O's. Everyone has a different idea. When I go to speak at a clinic, I try to give the coaches something that will give them some different ideas and things to think about.

The thing we try to do is to get in as many reps as we can in the time we have allotted for practice. A lot of coaches will talk about quality reps. Yes, you do want quality reps. However, getting kids lined up and getting them moving is very important. I go to a lot of high school and college practices, and I see five players working and 50 players standing around watching. What we try to do is to get everyone moving at a rapid pace. We want to create in practice the situation the players face in the game. I am sure everyone wants to do this.

We start off with running fundamentals. We do those 10 to 15 minutes per day. Next, we go to the chute-and-sled drills. We do a board drill as well. I have all of our fundamental drills on a tape. If you want to see it, I can get it to you.

We do half-line runs for 10 to 15 minutes per day. Most of you have only one offensive line coach. If you have two line coaches, that is a good situation. We work on the plays that we need to work on for that day as we go through the drill. We go "no-huddle rapid fire" on the left side, and then we do it on the right side. Then we swap sides between the 1s and 2s on offense and defense. This is with a quarterback and no backs. I find myself spending more time coaching the scout team than I do at times on our kids. It is important to get the look you want from the scout team. We are in the "no huddle with rapid fire" and then "no backs."

Everything is scripted for the drill. I have another man running the defense, and I have the 1s and 2s. Everything is filmed. If I see something wrong, I will correct it. We run a play and then bring the second group up on the line and run the play. This is rapid fire. We want as many reps as we can get. We are teaching on film rather than spending the time on the field. At the same time there are a few little things that you have to do, but you want to get as many reps as possible.

Next, we go full-line runs with our backs against the scout team. We go best against best early in the year. We do not do this much. We do not want anyone to get hurt. We want to be able to use them on Saturday. We do just enough early in the year to get their pencils sharpened. We will do four reps with the first group and four reps with the second group. Then we repeat the four reps with each group. After that we go two reps with each group. They end up getting 10 snaps each, best against the best and seconds against the seconds.

 





Page 19

Next, we go to our "blitz pick-up with backs" drill. This is not a high-intensity period. Again, it is scripted; it is geared to what we want that day. I am standing behind the line calling the plays: "Rapid-right 72." We do not have any quarterbacks or receivers in the drill. We get the defense lined up and work against the blitz we expect that week. You may make your guard and center interchangeable. This is the time to work with them. This is not a "get them tired" type drill. It is blitz pickup working on assignments. Again, we are in the no-huddle set. It is a 10-minute scripted drill.

Pass-protection fundamentals are the toughest thing to teach offensive linemen. We work on that 10 to 15 minutes per day. We have the bags, we do the steps, and we do the whole shooting match. We do that 10 to 15 minutes per day.

Then we do our half-line pass protection. Now we go back-to-back. The reason we go half line is because we do not want the big piles at the quarterback. We do not want anyone to get hurt. At the same time we want the quarterback to feel pressure and be able to react.

Last, we do team work for 30 minutes. We do two huddles at once. We go two huddles, and we run the same play. The second group gets to see the play against the defense. That is basically our practice schedule.

We are an I-formation football team. We run the option. If it were not for the option, we would not be where we are today. We have been ranked in the top 10 in our division for the last several years. We believe in hard-nosed football. A hard-nosed offense makes for a hard-nosed defense. There is no question, you win championships with defense. We believe that, and I am an offensive coach and have been for years. How do you get good defense? You do that by recruiting good players and by being hard-nosed on offense.

We run the toss sweep. We run it strong and weak. We believe in the toss sweep. We have good backs that can run, and we have fullbacks that can block. We do a little scheming, but not very much. We run the isolation series. We will run the ball right dead at you. It is hard-nosed "iso" downhill. We come off the ball and hit them in the mouth.

We have gone to a one-back zone play. It has been good for us. We run the wide, tight, and cutback. We call them wide, tight, and cutback. We do not get real fancy with it.

We have been fortunate to have had good fullbacks. We run four plays with the fullback. We run the belly, trap, dive, and cutback. We fake-sweep and give it to the fullback on the cutback.

We do run the option. We believe in the option. I have heard a lot of coaches say they did not want to run the option because they did not want to get the quarterback hit. We believe in the option, so we run it. We run the option with the fullback and quarterback, and we pitch the football.

We believe in the triple option. We work on the triple option every day during the two-a-days for 10 minutes. We go half line for 10 minutes. We have two quarterbacks running the drills. The most important thing is coaching the scout team. During the season we work twice a week on the option, going half line. On Tuesday and Wednesday we have the pads on, so we go 10 minutes per day on half-line option drills. We work very little on the double and speed options.

We run the belly option. Basically, it is a quarterback sweep play. We pull the guard and log or hook the end. We can run the play to the strong or weak side. The fullback is on the linebacker. The quarterback reverses out and hauls ass. He wants to get wide and run. The quarterback option is big against the blitz. We believe that this play keeps the blitz down in the two-back set. We can get some big plays off the belly option.

We run the misdirection game. We run the counter gap and pull the guard and tackle on the back side. That is basically our running game.

In our passing game we have basic protections. The toughest one is the drop-back pass. That is the one we spend most of our time on.

 





Page 20

Let me go over these very quickly. Our three-step game is gap protection. It is the passing game with the hitch routes. In maximum protection, if the defense gives you a bunch of blitz, you keep the backs in and have them check on the release. Sprint-draw protection is off our isolation series. Split-draw protection is just what it indicates, with split backs. Shotgun and drop-back protection is the toughest protection we have. People ask us what kind of offense we run. We tell them this: "We are an I-option, power-sweep, 'iso,' no-back, shotgun, and one-back offense." They say, "What? You are kidding me!" No! If we are in long-yardage situations, we get in the shotgun. We also use the option-pass protection. If you are going to run the option, you have to have the option pass. We run the ball down the line and make it look like the run. We throw to the wideouts in the perimeter game. We run the bootleg, waggle, and naked protections. We do not run them much, but we have them.

You have to have a plan if you are overmatched. If we are overmatched at the two tackles and they are getting upfield, we have a way to double them. We also have a way to sprint away from them. We have our sprint-out protection. We also have the ability to dash away from them. By 
dash 
we mean to pull the backside guard and get the quarterback on the edge if we are having trouble with the pass rush. We will let our offensive linemen use the cut block as a changeup block on our pass protection.

Next, I want to talk about our half-line option drill. We have the coaches stationed where they can watch the drill. The quarterback coach watches the quarterback and fullback. I am in between the two groups. We have our wide-receiver coach with one group and another coach with the other group. We are looking for reps.

Again, we run two groups at a time. We have a coach outside with the wideouts. Both groups go at one time. We rotate quarterbacks and fullbacks every play. We rotate the line every three plays. If you do not have many people, you would run one group at a time. This drill is to the boundary. We work two groups on offense, and the third team is our scout team. We work against all of the different looks to the boundary.

HALF-LINE OPTION DRILL TO THE BOUNDARY

When we face an eight-man front, we run our option to the field. If the defense has an eight-man front with a three-deep, we do not have enough men to run the option to the weak side. We run the option to the field. We run back-to-back half-line drills with two teams going at one time.

HALF-LINE OPTION DRILL TO FIELD, BACK-TO-BACK

 





Page 21

Again, the coaches are spread out so that they can see what is going on. We go back and forth and try to get as much done as possible. Again, we rotate the line every three plays and the backs every play. The quarterbacks rotate every other play. Again, we film it all.

We work on half-line blocking schemes. These are onside blocks only. We work the backside blocking during fundamentals. We go two groups side by side. I stand in the middle, and we go rapid fire. We work on the particular block we need that day. We do not have backs in the drill. We have a quarterback, and we use our snap count. We go on a quick count. We want a lot of reps here. We work all of the different individuals in the drill. We run to both sides. Then the second group goes. While one group is going, the other one is getting ready. We do not want to waste time. We work on the plays we need to go over for that day. Again, you have to work your center both ways. On one play he goes to the right, and the next play he goes to the left.

We do not flip-flop. We are right side, left side. Most people say flip-flopping is the best thing. The one thing I would be afraid on flip-flopping would be pass protection. That is the reason we do not use the flip-flop.

Next, we go to half-line pass. We want as many reps as we can get. We want to stay away from the big piles. We do not want anyone to get hurt. This is an all-pass drill. Everyone knows it is all-pass. It is a tough situation up front, and it is tough for the quarterback. It is the best drill we do as far as pass protection. We go with the right side at the top. The defense can do what they want, including using the blitz. We do not touch the quarterback on the drill. We tag the quarterback. We script all of the plays we are going to work on.

One group runs the play while the other group is getting their play in the huddle, one yard from the ball. In the game we huddle five yards from the ball. We do not waste time in practice getting from the huddle to the line. We are trying to get as many reps as possible and save as much time as we can. We are not concerned that the defense knows what we are calling. We feel that is overrated. We run the drill from the right hash, right middle, middle, left middle, and left hash. This way the quarterback gets a look at all the reads. We do not do a lot of coaching in this drill. We want reps. Our extra linemen are on a knee off to the side. We have a lot of players working here. Let's see the film.

HALF-LINE PASS DRILL: TWO GROUPS BACK TO BACK

Chris Brown

Building and Maintaining a Program 

West Grand High School, Colorado

I have come to this clinic for a long time. This clinic started in 1982 in Denver. Eddie Kintz was the first clinic director. I have made all of the clinics held here. This is a special time for me. It is a good time to talk things over and to get some new ideas. The cost of this clinic is only $60. They give you a nice travel bag when you register. That takes the cost down to $40. They give you all the beer you can drink, and now the cost is down to $20. They have 20 speakers here, so if this lecture is worth $1, we are OK. A lot of you got out of school on Friday, and that has to be worth $60. It is to me this time of the year. I am thinking about passing around a collection.

In 19761 started coaching. At that time the philosophy was "We are with you, win or tie." In 1986 the philosophy was this: "Coach, we are with you win or win." By 1996 the philosophy was this: They do not care if you win or not, as long as their son gets a full scholarship.

I would like to thank John Burke for having me on the clinic. I coached with John in the All-State game. I have worked with John on the Coaches Board of Directors. I even have ties to the person who started these clinics, Duffy Daugherty. I do not know how many of you even knew who Duffy was. I grew up in Michigan just north of Lansing. I got to caddie for Duffy in a golf tournament for three days. I can't remember what he paid me or what his score was, but I do wish I could remember some of the jokes he told. He made the caddie stay close to him so he could tell his jokes. Of course, I was a Michigan State fan, and they were good during that time. That was a real treat for me.

One person asked me if I was going to talk about our weight program. I am not. What I want to do today is to share some opinions and ideas on how to build and maintain a good solid program. We have been successful, and I will tell you what we did in our program. I say "opinion" and "ideas" because I do not have any answers. There are many ways to achieve success. There are many ways to run an offense, defense, and other phases of the game. In 21 years as a head coach, I have realized that I do not have many answers, but I do have some strong opinions.

First, I want to talk about what coaching means to me. Our philosophy is simple. You need something to hang your hat on. It is simple for me:

(1) Have West Grand High School football be a positive experience for every player. Just think about that one statement. Sometimes that is tough to do. That is our goal.

(2) Have each player be a better person for having been in the program.

(3) Treat each player as I would want my son to be treated. I try to do that with each kid. I have a son who I am fortunate enough to coach now. He is a junior. I watched him grow up being the ball boy and now a player. That has really been important to me through the years.

(4) Take the talent we have and maximize it to the fullest. We were 13-0. In 1985 we were 4-6, and that was probably the best coaching we ever did. Sometimes when you have a losing record, it does not mean you did a poor coaching job. Sometimes a winning record does not mean you did a great job with the talent you have.

Next, I want to go over the things we want to accomplish:

(1) We want to teach and lead with class and integrity. For us that is important: how we treat our opponents, our kids, officials, teachers, and everyone we come in contact with. We get letters from restaurants, old ladies, and others on how our players act and dress when they are out. That gets back to the school board, and that is important to them. If we ever go 0-10, we hope

 





Page 23

we can drag those letters out and have the board read them.

(2) We want to communicate to our players at all times. (a) They should know what is expected of them on and off the field. (b) They should know their status. (c) They should know they fit into the program.

(3) Our team should be fundamentally sound and well disciplined. The highest compliment I have gotten is when another coach told me our team was fundamentally sound and well disciplined.

(4) We should improve daily and weekly. We want to learn from the best. You can learn from anyone, but learn from the best. I followed Lloyd Gasket. He won 10 state championships. I do not know how many second places he finished. One thing he taught me was this. He said, "Chris, don't try to change everything." He said, "Bite off a little at a time. Get it done, and then go to the next thing you want to change." Lloyd gave me a lot of ideas.

I was in a coffee club that met at 7:30. Bob Smith was a principal, and he was a three-sports star in high school and college. I think he had 12 letters in college. He was a catcher for the New York Yankee organization. He was at the AAA level. The Yankee catcher hurt his leg, and so Bob was to move up, but he broke his leg. The next guy to move up was Elston Howard.

Don Kimble was our band director. This man never took worse than first in the state. How many of you can say that? That was for 31 years.

Another person I learned from was Warren Mitchell. He won more state championships than anyone else. He won the state in several sports, including football, basketball, and track. We would sit around and talk. I would ask him questions. It is amazing how much you can learn from these people. What I am trying to get across to you is this. You have to find those guys. You can always find someone to talk with.

Another way to learn is by reading. Here is a book on Bear Bryant. It came out in 1974. I still read this book each year before we start football. I think I know it by heart, but I read it anyhow. I am not an Alabama fan, but I am a Bear Bryant fan after reading his book.

You can learn a lot at these clinics. If you ever buy anything, it is this manual. I'm talking about the 
Coach of the Year Clinics Football Manual. 
Here is the first one I got, and it was in 1980. Woody Hayes is on the front cover. If you want to know about history and war, he was the man that knew about it. But he also knew something about football.

I went to see Ohio State when they played Michigan State. Woody was out there in his short-sleeved shirt and black hat. He is the one who started soccer-style kicking. Woody would throw his hat down, and he would kick the sideline markers. Then things would go flying out on the field. I think that is where the soccer-style kicking got started. You can watch games and learn what colleges and other teams are doing. You can scout other teams and learn from them.

Someone asked me what is tradition. We all have tradition. Every school and every coach that has been coaching a while has tradition. To me tradition is how others view your program. It is also how your players, parents, community, and related others view your program. For better or worse, we all have tradition. It does not matter whether you have a winning or a losing program.

The next question is how to get a tradition going. How do you establish your own team tradition? I will give you a few ideas on what we do to establish some of our traditions. One of the things we do is to wear a shirt and tie to games. This includes the coaches as well as the players. We coach in shirts and ties, both home and away games.

Another thing we do is this. The moms make us treats every day during the play-offs. The kids love this. Our kids are like zoo animals. You feed them, and they expect it all of the time.

Another tradition we have relates to the dropkick. Two years ago they were going to take the dropkick out of the rule books and eliminate it from football. I wrote a

 





Page 24

letter to the rules committee, and we kept it in. I like to think my letter saved the dropkick. We may be the only team that still does the dropkick anymore. My dad taught me the technique to drop-kick. It has been important to me to keep the dropkick in the books. My dad is still living, and he played when they used the dropkick.

We started using the dropkick, and it became a tradition. In 1978 we did it in a game finally. We were ahead at the time, and the kid tried the dropkick and made it. The referee come over and gave me a hug. He said that he had been officiating for 40 years and when he played football that is what they used to do. He was retiring at the end of that game, and he had not seen the dropkick used in all of his years of officiating. What we do is to have a senior dropkick contest. Some of the kids who do not play football go out and practice drop-kicking. This year we had a lot of good kickers. We even had a soccer-style kicker drop-kick the ball. That was a first for us. In one game he made five or six kicks drop-kicking. We even drop-kicked a couple of kickoffs. It is a fun thing to do, and when we are way ahead or way behind, we use it. Establish your own tradition.

Let me talk about assistant coaches. When I first came out of college in 1976, I tried to coach it all. I was the head coach of everything. The assistants got to coach their positions, and that was it. We started out and were 1-3. After we got beat in our homecoming game, I decided to turn over the defense to one of the assistants. That was the best thing that happened to me. I learned to let assistants coach. It is important to let them have responsibility. It gives them ownership in the team. When we get an award for the season, it is for all of the coaches and not just the head coach. It takes a whole staff to be successful. Our coaches go scouting together and watch films together.

Next, I want to talk about recruiting in your school. Football numbers are important. We all know that. Track and football are the only two sports where you can have a lot of kids out there. It would be good to have five football programs if we had enough players out. What we do is this. We make a list of 8th, 9th, and 10th graders not out for football. It is not so important for the older kids. We have 45 to 50 kids out for football. We have kids walking the halls that should be playing. I am sure it is the same at your school. I am not talking about the butt heads. I am talking about good kids. They may not be good athletes, but they are good kids. They get good grades, and they are dependable. They could be helping your program, and you could be helping them. We get some kids who stick with it and some who quit. But we really make an effort to get more players out for the team. Another thing we have done is to write a letter to each class. We send the team a letter on the subject, and then I send individuals letters encouraging them to give football a try.

On the other side of the issue is weight lifting versus other sports. I would rather have players in another sport than lifting. I teach weight-lifting classes. I get most of the team lifting. We have really seen some progress, but I would much rather have them playing basketball and hockey.

You must realize that attitude is the key. I always start the season with this point. I tell our team that our season will depend on our attitude and our offensive line. I put the pressure on the offensive line right away. I would always rather take an average player with a great attitude than a great player with a poor attitude. I seem to do the best coaching job when I have a great player with a great attitude. I can do a good job of coaching that type kid. If I had more of them, I could really do a good job. An average player with a great attitude can play for you.

Potential will get you beat. We play performers and producers. Also along these lines, we play and practice with enthusiasm. We have fun during the game. A lot of teams will look at us before the game, and we do not say a word. We got out-yelled 13 times this year before the game. We do not waste our energy yelling during the pregame.

We probably do our best job in placement of our personnel. We do an off-season scouting report. Basically, we take a look at the personnel, see whether we need to switch players to other positions, and see what we have to do to be up to date.

 





Page 25

The next area is what we list as playing time and our JV system. We guarantee our freshmen, sophomores, and juniors that they will start somewhere on the JV team. We keep the players and parents happy that way. Also, we are building up the team for next year. This increases enthusiasm and helps the players develop a good attitude about the game. We are a Class A school, but we play Class AA and AAA teams on the JV level. We do not guarantee the seniors anything.

On the varsity level we use all of our one-way starters and our best JVs on our special teams. Now, this ties more players to the varsity level. As far as counting quarters, the kicking game does not count, so we can get kids in the game who are not starters.

Let me talk about the seniors. Next year we will have about 18 seniors. We do not have captains. All of our seniors are captains. Each year I have the seniors over to my house for steaks. We talk about leadership, tradition, and our expectations. We do everything we can to play seniors. We cannot guarantee that they will start. Our seniors expect their best year next year because we had a good year this past year.

The next area relates to penalties, turnovers, execution, and fundamentals. We teach the rules. You would be surprised to find out what your players do not know about the rules, especially in the kicking game.

We really stress turnovers just as you do. We stress taking care of the football on offense and creating opportunities on defense. This past year we were plus28 in turnovers. We teach fundamentals and stress them all of the time. One way we do this is with the perfect play drill. Instead of running sprints, one day we will tell the team they must run five perfect plays before they can go in. As the coach, you can decide how perfect the plays are. It depends on how hard you want to work them at the end of practice.

This next area may be something that a lot of you do not believe in, but we do not hit much in practice. Once the season starts, we hit for only five minutes for the week, and that is it. We play most of our games on Saturday. I think we have two games on Friday night. We have very few injuries. We may go down on the goal line, put our best 22 kids against each other, and go live for 10 plays.

We have most of our JV games on Monday. Our varsity will watch film and go out and stretch. We may not even go out on Monday. We practice Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Some days we do not practice on Friday because we go to scout other teams. Some of the teams we play are four hours away, so we go scout them and do not practice on Friday before a Saturday game.

Let me list some results of not hitting so much after the season starts. (1) We have very few injuries. We want our best players playing on Friday night or Saturday. (2) It keeps the moms happy. (3) It keeps the players fresh. They are mentally and physically fresh. (4) The game becomes special to the players. It is more than just someone new to hit and another chance to wear the game uniform. On Wednesday or Thursday after the JVs have played on Monday, we may take them at the end of practice and hit for 15 to 20 minutes. (5) It allows us to gear up for 13 games and a longer season.

There is one drawback to this hitting rule. We do not block or tackle well early in the year. We know this going into the year.

We do not let our freshman kids go live against the varsity players. We want to protect the freshmen at all times. We do not want to run off any players. You do not know the type of player a freshman will make. We want to keep as many players as we can, not run them off.

We use an off-season scouting report. We use last year's films. First, we scout ourselves. We look at our personnel. We look to see what we did right and what we need to improve on. We take a look at the plays to see whether we need to change or add or drop plays for the next year.

We scout our opponents. We look at their personnel and their offense, defense, and kicking game. We do

 





Page 26

this on every team we play. We do this in the offseason. We get them back out in the summer and update them.

We do an evaluation of the drills we do. The criteria we use for our drills is this: They must adapt to game situations. When I played, we used a drill called the monkey roll. I am sure some of you have done the drill. Do you ever see anyone use the monkey roll in a game? We want the drill to adapt to a game situation.

Now I will talk about our offense. The best advice I can give young coaches is this: ''Be known for something.'' For us, we are known for the option and the play-action pass. We run out of the I formation. I see a lot of teams that change their offense because of the personnel they have coming back. Some years we will have the leading rusher in the state. Some years we will have the leading passer or the leading receiver. Some years we are a ball-control team. Some years we are a big-play team. But, we are always in the I set. We do something different each year, but 85 to 90 percent of our offense is the same every year.

The other thing we do is to limit the number of plays we run. When I first started coaching, we had six running plays and four passing plays, and we won the state championship. When I look back, that told me something. Bobby Bowden said if they add a play, they have to take one out of their offense first. If you are going to add one, take one out.

We really try to balance our run and pass plays. You usually are good at one or the other. If you are really good at one or the other, then you had better work on getting the worst part better. This year we had 30 TDs running and 30 TDs passing. That is balance, but it does not always work out that way.

When you look at your offense, you should evaluate your practice time spent versus how often it is used in a game. We spend a lot of time working on plays, but when we get in the game we never run them. We may run them once or twice. I am talking about your base offense.

It is important to package your plays to get the most out of them. We start out with a base play. Then we have an extension and a misdirection out of the play. Next, we have play-action passes. Finally, we have our special plays.

We work hard on our execution and situations. When I said we go against the bags, it does not mean we are not working. We used to go out and scrimmage in the middle of the field. Not any more. Now we work on situations such as goal line, coming out, 3rd and 10, and two-minute offense.

On defense it is the same thing as offense. Once you know what you are doing, you can adjust. You need to be known for something on defense. This year we saw several different formations. We saw the spread, fullhouse, run-and-shoot, pro, trips, single-wing, shotgun, and wing-T formations. Take your defense, and figure out how to adjust your defense to meet different formations. We are a 6-2 team and could adjust to those sets.

I think there are four things you need to have a great defense. It does not matter what level you are on; these still apply:

(1) Assignments and alignments. Make sure the kids know what they are doing before you play a team.

 





Page 27

(2) Get off blocks. I do not care what position you play, you must be able to get off the blocks. We use a drill we call "get off the block." We do the drill with bags.

(3) You need to learn to run to the football to have a great defense. We use a burst drill, a pursuit drill, and a pride drill to teach players to get to the ball.

(4) Good tackling is a must to have a good defense. We use a lot of drills on this. We run these drills with them: hit and fit, one man, Burma, open field, scramble, and eye opener.

Let me go over one or two more points before we get out of here. First is punt for points. We have had the All-State punter for the last two years. We have had the All-State punter more than our share.

We do this drill at the end of practice. We may have enough players for four or five teams. You divide the players into teams. We are looking for three things on the punt-for-points drill. We want to work on punt coverage, communication, and conditioning. We line up in punt formation and go down and cover the punt. You can put the ball on the 50-yard line or whatever yard line you feel your punter can reach. The punt is made, and the team covers the kick. If the ball lands between the 15- and 10-yard lines, you get one point. If it lands between the 5- and 10-yard lines, you get two points. If it lands between the goal line and 5-yard line, you get three points. If the ball goes in the end zone, you do not get a point. If you want, you can double the points for kicking the ball out of bounds near the end zone. You set a goal for the number of points you want them to reach. If the goal is seven points, when a team gets seven points, they can drop out and watch the other groups. There are a lot of variations you can use with the drill.

The last point is what we call extra-point reduction. We may tell the team we are going to run 30- to 40-yard sprints after practice, but we will go for the extra-point reduction. We have two kickers and a guest kicker. We line up with our two regular kickers. We line up with no referees and no defense, and we are kicking the PATs. We let them kick, and if they make them, we reduce the number of sprints they have to run. We keep moving them back after they make a kick. We are putting the kickers under pressure. We will do some bag rushing, but we are going against air here. Some days we may not run many sprints, and some days we may run a lot of them. This encourages team spirit. They really cheer for those kickers. We may have to adjust the number of sprints they run, but it is fun.

I hope I have given you some ideas. Thank you.

The OSU Running Game

Ohio State University

Thank you very much. It's good to be with you today. It is an exciting time of year for me. It is an exciting time of year for anyone in the coaching profession. I used to come to these clinics all the time. In my opinion probably the best coach who has ever coached the game of football was Paul "Bear" Bryant. Coach Bryant used to get up and tell coaches, "If you can live without it, don't coach." I have thought of that over the years. My son played college football for me, and I used to tell him that I didn't want him to go into coaching. I wanted him to get another job. Looking back, I think that was a mistake. I wish he had got into coaching.

I love coaching. I tell people all the time that if I ever get out of coaching, I'll have to get a job. It is a great way to make a living. When I get up in the morning, I can't wait to get to the office. I hope most of you feel that same way. Right now we are looking at tapes of last year's games. We are looking at the good and bad things we did last year. We get in a workout every day. I'm a strong believer in being in coaching condition. It keeps you young. It gives you a chance to work out with your players. We work out in the weight room with our players. When they see us in there, they want to get in there and work out too. It is a fun job, and we all make good money. We are making more money than we ever dreamed we would be making. You get a chance to work with these young players. I don't know what the hell I'd be doing if I were not coaching. It is a great profession. And to think you have any influence over these young guys is a very gratifying feeling.

Every time I go visit somewhere, I ask the question, "What is the best thing about your program?" At Ohio State obviously we have good players. We have some great football players at Ohio State. But the best thing about our program is the chemistry and the work effort of our players. The best thing we do at Ohio State is our off-season program. You win in the winter conditioning program. Our players love to come in and work out. I think we have the best strength coach in the country. A lot of our former players who are playing pro ball work out with us. If you come up to our place at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, you will see Eddie George, Terry Glenn, Ricky Dudley, Joey Galloway, Orlando Pace, and a lot of others in there working out. Our players love to have those pro players around there working out.

Our football players spend 12 months a year in Columbus, Ohio. I tell them they don't have to be there in the summer, but if they're not, they are not going to play. They are all there during the summertime. That is why we have a good football team. They are there, and they work their butts off.

We have a saying at our place: "What you see is what you coach." When you look at films of your games, what you see is a reflection of you. There are a lot of things you can control. You may not be able to control the ability of your players, but you can coach them to line up properly. You can coach them to get in a good stance and not make mistakes and things of that nature. Teams that jump offside and get all kinds of penalties are a reflection of how you coach them during the week. When you run a defensive drill, you should move on the ball. Move on the ball, don't go on a cadence. Everything we do in the winter conditioning program with our defense is movement on the ball. Little things like that you can control.

I believe that your players will play as well as you expect them to play. If you talk about next year being a rebuilding year or "we're not very fast," then you are setting your team up. You will not be very good. At our place we lose more underclassmen than anybody. We have lost about 10 underclassmen to the pros. This year Shawn Springs and Orlando Pace are leaving early. I don't worry about guys I don't have. Don't worry about things you don't have control over. When one leaves

 





Page 29

early, that gives another one a chance to play. Those young players will play about as well as you expect them to play.

In our league we think that you have to be able to run the football and defensively you have to stop the other team from running the ball against you. There are a lot of good coaches in the Big Ten. If you can only run the ball, everyone will play you in a nine-man front. If all you can do is throw the ball, they will play you in nothing but a nickel package and take away what you can do. I think the game of football is being coached better now than at any other time. Now you have to be multiple. You better be able to run the ball and throw it. You have to do both. At our place we want to be about 60 percent to 40 percent run-to-pass. We have good balance in our offense.

You have to play great defense. Two of my very best defensive coaches are lecturing here later on this afternoon. I would advise you to go listen to them if you want to know what we are doing defensively. Last year we had a great defensive football team. We gave up an average of 10 points a game, and we play a great schedule. You win with defense. To have a good defensive football team, you have to commit good personnel to that side of the ball. You don't suddenly decide that you are going to play good defense. At our place our best players play on the defensive side of the ball.

We recruit linemen who can run. If they can run at all, we are going to give them a chance to play defense. If they can't play defense, we move them over to the offense. We take the good athletes and put them on defense. Shawn Springs could have been a great wide receiver or running back. But he was a great corner. What you are going to see in our league is the corners playing man-to-man and everyone else stopping the run. That is why you must run the ball and throw it. You have to use a lot of different formations and utilize the strengths of your football team.

At our place you have to win. I found that out at the first Buckeye booster meeting I went to. They assured me that they were 100 percent behind me, win or tie. 3ut they said, "Don't tie too many." I went down to buy a house. I talked to the real estate lady. She asked me what I did for a living. I told her I was the new football coach at Ohio State. She said I should rent this first year. We had an awful football team my first year. I made a mistake. I went in and talked about rebuilding and that we do not have any talent. Well, that is the way we played.

I don't brag a lot or lure players on the field. But I spend a lot of time in the locker room and weight room telling our young players how good I think they are going to be next year. We expect to have a hell of a football team next year, although we lost eight defensive players. We lost six offensive starters, but we expect to have a hell of a team. The Buckeyes are going to be good again next year. I tell that to our players all the time. Nobody is going to outwork us. Nobody is going to coach better than we coach. Nobody is going to work harder in the winter program.

We have a sign in our locker room and in our big meeting room. This is what we hang our hats on: 
Nothing keeps us from winning. 
I don't want to hear any reason why in the hell we don't win. I don't want to hear about lack of speed, size, or talent; inexperience; or anything else. I don't want to hear about injuries or the pregame meal. Don't talk about the officials or bad calls. In my opinion all you do when you talk about those things is to give yourself some reason why you got your butt beat. We don't do that. I don't care what it is. I don't want to hear about it. Just get the job done. I heard Joe Paterno one year, and he said he didn't believe in signs, but if he did, it would be, "Don't bitch about your players, because they are the only ones you've got." You can't trade them or draft some more. You better take the players you have coming back and make them into winners. That is the attitude we have.

Quickly let me show you some things that we hang our hat on. These are not original. They are called the 10 commandments. Tennessee uses them now, and Alabama used to use them.

(1) The team that makes the fewest mistakes usually wins the game. We don't make many mistakes. We don't turn the ball over much. We are not going to make a lot of stupid penalties.

 





Page 30

(2) You play for and make breaks. When one comes your way, you have to score.

(3) If at first the game of breaks goes against you, don't slow down. Put on more steam.

(4) Stress the kicking game, because this is where the breaks are made.

(5) Protect your passer and kicker, and rush their passer and kicker.

(6) Be mentally alert at all times, and leave nothing to chance.

(7) Carry out your assignment.

(8) Intercept the football.

(9) Carry the fight to your opponents. Hit them hard and fast.

(10) Win the surest way.

When you talk about the running game at OSU, we have had some great talents. We had a great back in Robert Smith, who left early. Raymont Harris stepped in. After Raymont graduated, Eddie George stepped in. After Eddie came Peppy Pearson. After him will come someone else. That is the attitude we have.

Robert Smith gained 1100 yards as a true freshmen. After Robert left, Raymont stepped in and gained 1344 rushing in the first year he played for us. He plays for the Chicago Bears now. Then came Eddie George. The first year Eddie played for us he gained 1500 yards. His second year he gained 1900 yards and won the Heisman Trophy. After that came Pepe Pearson. His first year he gained 1484 yards rushing. That's not bad for a first-year guy. He will be a senior next year. Guys, mark it down. Pepe Pearson will probably lead the nation in rushing next year. That is what I'm telling him now. I'm telling him I expect him to be the best running back in the conference next year. I told him he gained more yards in his first year than Eddie George did.

Next year I expect him to gain 2000 yards. I'm telling him that right now, almost every day. He is working his butt off. He is 6' 0" and about 205 pounds. He runs a 4.3 forty. He is a tough kid and ain't going to get hurt. He can catch the ball coming out of the backfield. He will be All Big Ten and All American and might win the Heisman. He is going to be my running back, and I want him to believe that.

We talk about balance in our offense. Last year we rushed for 2700 yards and threw for 2500 yards. You better be able to run and pass in the Big Ten. When we line up against Penn State, if we can't throw the ball, we can't beat them. Michigan and Notre Dame are the same way. If we can line up and run the ball, we are going to pound on you all day. If you are smart enough to take our running game away, we better be able to throw the ball. You have to have balance in your offense.

In the winter conditioning program your team should get bigger and stronger. We want to build confidence and a physical attitude. We want to win games up front. At Ohio State we run the ball to set up the pass. When you play us, you better buckle your chin strap on tight. You have to get down in the trenches, because we are coming after you. If you stop us, we will do something else. If you have nine people committed to the line of scrimmage, we'll run a play-action pass at you and burn you for a big play.

We run the football to make our defense physical. How are you going to be a good defensive team if you don't face a good running football team? We face each other in the spring and, more important, in two days in the fall. One thing is important at all levels of football. On the high school, college, and pro level, you have to learn how to practice. We go against each other every day. But we don't get people hurt. We tell them the first day that they can't get hurt. We had 11 defensive football players who started 13 straight football games last season. They don't get hurt because they know how to practice. We are always in headgear. Most of the time we are in headgear and shoulder pads. Everything we do in practice, we always stay on our feet. We pound on each other every day, but we stay up. We tackle every day, but we don't put the ball carriers on the ground. That way we don't get hurt. Our players get hit in practice but don't get beat up.

We run our inside drill with our best offense against our best defense every day. During the season our pad

 





Page 31

days are Tuesday and Wednesday, and we go seven on nine during those days. We spend 16 minutes with seven on offense against nine defensive players. We bring our safeties into the drill. We go best on best, full speed. Everything is full speed, except you don't tackle the ball carrier. You butt the hell out of him, but you don't put him on the ground. That makes us a physical team. We are going to stop the run and run the football.

Our defensive back and wide receiver work against each other every day. We work best on best in a manto-man scheme. We work that way for at least two periods every day. That makes us better offensively and defensively. We had Shawn Springs on one side and Ty Howard on the other. They played man to man, which allowed the safeties to crowd the line of scrimmage and run the alleys. We played a nine-man front almost all year long.

There are some things you need in your offense. You have to have power inside and speed on the perimeter. You also have to have some finesse, because there are some teams on your schedule that you are not going to be able to just run north and south on. You need some draws, counters, and screens. I'm also going to add an option next year. We are going to run more option because of the styles of defense we are facing. We are facing a lot of man coverage, with the safeties running the alley. They are playing five under and two deep. We are going to mix more option in our offense to control what the defense is doing.

When we are on offense, we are in charge. We know the snap count. We are going to get out of the huddle, sprint to the line, and go. But we are also going to have a freeze call to draw the defense offside. We want to control the tempo of the game. We will give you a lot of different sets. We want the defense to have to think. If the defense is thinking, they are less aggressive and will make mistakes. We run basic plays from a lot of different sets and formations.

We use three types of blocking schemes. We use a man, gap, and zone scheme. The man scheme is exactly W`hat it says. The gap is a double-down and kick-out type of scheme. And the zone scheme is exactly what it says. We work on the board with our best on best, just like the seven on nine. We want to take advantage of our best players. We have had some great offensive linemen at Ohio State. The best one we've ever had was Orlando Pace. He is 6' 7", weighs 330 pounds, runs a 4.9 forty, benches 500 pounds, and goes bear hunting with a switch. He is a 
footballplayer. 
The first day he walked on campus, he was our starting left tackle. We played 13 true freshmen last year and started two. Our middle linebacker was a freshman. He will probably be the next great linebacker to come out of Ohio State. We had a freshman wide receiver who caught 13 passes against Indiana and two touchdown passes in the Rose Bowl game. We are not afraid to play freshmen. We don't guarantee freshmen that they will play. We tell them the best players play. If a freshman comes in and is better than an upperclassman, he plays. In your game plan you should take advantage of your best players, attack the defense with personnel and alignment, and make them defend the entire field.

Our backs read the defense pre-snap. They know whether they are going to cut back or stay straight ahead. We try to predetermine before the ball is snapped whether to cut it back or bounce out. When we are using our gap scheme, which is our doubledown and kick-out scheme, we want to run downhill toward the line of scrimmage. We do an awful lot of "check with me" calls at the line of scrimmage. We call a run or pass depending on what the defense is doing. We count the people in the box. If you have six in the box, we run the ball. If you have seven in the box, we throw the ball. We can run the play both ways with the "check with me" call. In the huddle we call "24-25 check with me.'' When we come to the line of scrimmage, the quarterback decides which side to run. We use our quick-passing game in the "check with me" scheme.

We use movement to try to create mismatches with personnel. We want to be flexible. We run from a lot of different personnel groupings. We are going to run in all situations. Going in, coming out, long yardage, and short yardage are situations where we are going to run the ball. That sets up our play-action passes. We think we are a great play-action-passing team. In the Rose Bowl, we lined up in two tight ends and one flanker.

 





Page 32

We protected our throw well and hit our wide receiver for a 79-yard touchdown. It was from a running formation and a "check with me" call.

Here are some of the things we are doing offensively. We do this if you let us. We line up in the I formation and run power football. We run the isolation both ways. If our fullback can block your linebacker, you are in trouble. We will run our 22-23 isolation play 15 to 20 times a game, if our fullback can block your linebacker. We try to predetermine which one of your linebackers is not really physical. If you have two good linebackers inside who are better than our fullback, we are not going inside.

Coaching is not asking your players to do things they can't do. If our fullback can't handle your inside linebackers, we'll go to two tight ends. That makes the defense balance and puts them in a situation where they can't hide anyone. Most people are like us. Our Will linebacker is about half and half. He is about half strong safety and half linebacker. He is a 205pound linebacker. If we play a team that is trying to hide a guy like that, we go to our two tight ends. We double-down and kick out on him. That gives us a mismatch between our fullback and your Will linebacker.

In the Rose Bowl Arizona State had a defensive end who was all Pac 10. He was 6' 2", and 222 pounds. He was a great pass rusher, and they played him on the split-end side. We lined up and traded our tight end over to the other side. We had a 6'7", 265-pound tight end blocking on this 222-pound pass rusher. It was a mismatch. To make up for the mismatch, they went to an eight-man front. That forced them into man coverage in the secondary. We run both our tight ends on short patterns to the left.

Their corner and free safety were playing man to man on them. Our freshman wide receiver, Darrell Boston, was man to man against the other corner with half the field to work into. He ran a post cut, and we hit him for 79 yards off a play-action pass. When we had Joey Galloway two years ago, people were afraid to play eight-man fronts on us. If they did, they had to play Galloway man to man. There is not one guy in the world who can cover Joey Galloway man to man. There is too much speed out there to defend with one man.

You guys have a wrong impression about Ohio State if you think that all we do is run the ball. We have more guys in the NFL playing wide receiver than anyone. They played at Ohio State, where we run off tackle all day. The point I am trying to make is that we do both: run and pass.

The first play we are going to try to run against you is our bread-and-butter play. It is the 22-23 isolation. The coaching points are pretty simple. We use a man blocking scheme. The onside tackle lead-steps the defensive tackle to the outside and tries to stretch him as wide as possible. The tight ends base up on the defensive end. The onside guard and center double the nose guard to the backside linebacker. The backside guard and tackle turn out on the reduced front to the weak side. The fullback comes off the double team and isolates the inside backer. That is the first play in our offense that we try to run. We work hard on this play in practice. It is a physical play. This is how we toughen our linebackers in the spring. They have to step forward and meet that fullback at the line.

The next play we run is our 24-25 sprint draw. This is the same kind of blocking scheme, except it is run off a play-action passing action. Our tailback takes a little hop and crossover step and gets the ball deeper. The blocking is the same, except the back runs to daylight. We had Orlando Pace playing our left tackle. Because he was such a good run blocker and we ran at him so much, defenses would align four defensive men to his side. It is hard to run the sprint draw toward him when you can't account for all the defenders.

To help us, we ran motion with our flanker to get an extra blocker to that side to account for the fourth

 





Page 33

defender. We could go to two tight ends and get the same results. We are going to use motion, alignment, or formation to handle the fourth defender. We are not going to let the defense dictate to us what we have to do. If we didn't do any of that, we would run the other way.

Last year we didn't have the big, blocking fullback we've had in the past. But you don't have to pancake a linebacker to have an effective block. If the fullback can get a stand off, stay on his feet, and keep them moving, we can live with that block. If he can keep his man from making the tackle, that is fine with us.

The other power play we are going to run is the old double-down and kick-out. If you have a defensive end who is thinking about stopping the quarterback by rushing upfield, we will run a lot of this play. If our fullback can block your end, you can bet on seeing this one. We can get in two tight ends and run it both ways. We have two big, physical tight ends at Ohio State. They are 6'6" and 265 and 250 pounds. We are going to make the small linebacker defend the running game. They had better be able to get off a block. We run our gap scheme on this play. We block down with everyone on the play side. The backside guard pulls into the hole, and the tailback runs off tackle. This play is our 4647.

We coach our defensive ends to cross-arm or wrong-shoulder the kick-out block and make the ball bounce. That is the way just about everyone is playing this type of play. We are getting our ends into 6 and sometimes 7 techniques to keep from getting vertical holes in our defense. That is why this play is hard to run. We run it in passing situations, because we think your defensive end may be thinking about getting upfield to sack the quarterback. If you stop the play, we get the punting team on the field, kick the ball, and play great defense.

Too many times we have too many guys coaching the point of attack. I want guys blocking away from the point of attack. To me those are the important blocks. We want to work on those backside blocks so that plays can break for long gainers. We don't want the single or double. We want a home run.

OK, guys, I think that's it. Does anybody have any questions? We have spring practice in April. We don't have any secrets. Our salvation is you, the high school coaches. Any time we can help you in any way, let us know. Come on up and see us any time. Thanks a lot.

George Curry

Developing High School Quarterbacks

Berwick High School, Pennsylvania

Men, it is good to be back in the state of Kentucky. I was in Kentucky exactly 30 years ago. I was down in Lexington. The weather is a little different this time. Thirty years ago it was hotter than hell in Lexington. It is good to be here, and I want to congratulate those of you who are here for coming out to this clinic. I am an administrator in our high school. There is something about football coaches. I am the assistant superintendent in our school system. I have always made other teachers mad in our system. I tell them this: "If you people would work at your job as hard as the football coaches work at their job, no one would be able to touch us as far as education goes." I am sure they do not want to hear that. Men, I mean that. It is a pleasure to be here. I congratulate those of you who have come here to try to learn one or two things to help you become a better football coach.

My topic today is developing high school quarterbacks. Before I talk about the X's and O's, I want you to know that we are not a big high school, but we do play the big high schools. Some of you may say that we get a lot of talent at our school. That is true. But we handpick our quarterback. We have 350 boys in our school. We played the 4A schools. Our whole schedule was against 4A schools. I am not going to bullcrap with you. I will tell you how we approach quarterbacks and how we teach them, and I will take you through the things we do with our quarterbacks. I have four grad assistants who will assist me with the demonstrations.

I have had 13 Division I quarterbacks since 1971.1 think it all has something to do with the way we approach the quarterback position. It has to do with the way we pick the quarterback and how we work with the quarterback.

There are two things that I feel are important in developing the quarterback. Number one is mechanics. You can coach the hell out of mechanics, which we do. The second phase of it is decision making. We have 210 players in our program from 7th grade to 12th grade. Every kid in Berwick plays football unless you are handicapped or an oddball. We tell them we will teach them the quarterback mechanics, and we also do a segment on decision making. I have had some great quarterbacks. I had Powlus, Kelchner, and Orlando, who is now with the Cincinnati Bengals. Those quarterbacks were decision makers. I do not give a darn how far a kid can throw the football. I do not want to hear that. There are kids that look good in the punt, pass, and kick contest. I want the player who can make decisions. A quarterback is a decision maker under duress. When the pressure is on the quarterback, he must make a quick decision. That is the kind of kid we want. We have a way of training those players.

We start with the mechanics, men. We break the mechanics down into two areas: passing mechanics and running mechanics. First, I want to go over the passing mechanics. I will not be able to get very far in the time I have today. I will go until they run me off the stage.

There are three things you must look at when you are trying to develop a quarterback as far as passing mechanics. First is developing the hands. Next is developing from the waist up. Third is developing from the waist down. We take the body and break it down into three areas. We spend a lot of time on the last two-from the waist up and from the waist down.

Some of you may wonder what I am talking about in regard to the hands. I have been in coaching 30 years, and I can tell you that you do not want a kid in your program who has bad hands. We want a player with good hands to handle the ball on every down. That includes games when the field is wet and muddy. How many of you ever looked at the hands of your quarterbacks when you picked them? Have you ever looked at their hands? I have 21 quarterback

 





Page 35

candidates in my junior high program. I look at everything about them. I check their feet and their hands. I check everything except their penis. I check everything about them. I want to know what my quarterback is all about. I want a kid with hands that are big enough so he can handle and throw the football.

We start off with a couple of hand drills. I have three grad assistants here to demonstrate. First, we do the palm drill. We just take the ball and hold it out palm down. Then we do the around-the-waist drill. We just pass the ball around our waist. Next, we do the figure 8 drill.

I got a great drill from Paul Hackett. It simulates the center snap. We want the quarterback to be aware of the snap at all times. When you do these hand drills, you are strengthening your fingers and hands as you grasp the ball. The kids get down in position, bounce the ball off the ground, and grasp it like a snap. This develops the hands. We do a series of these drills every day. We do those drills every day in the weight room. I tell my quarterback and centers that they will always have three balls as long as they are at Berwick High School. They have the two God gave them, and they will have a football in their hand. When our players get through lifting weights, they are going to do those hand drills.

Next, we do a seat drill. Next, we do a one-hand snap and have the quarterback take the snap and try to curl the football. [Demo] Everything is done with the hands. I want to make the kids aware of the hands. If we are playing a game in front of 12,000 people, I do not want the ball on the ground.

In the hand drills we are trying to simulate the snap, and we are trying to strengthen the fingers and hands. We want to make him aware that they are the most critical part of his body.... I better watch what I say because we have a lady in the audience.

Next, we will discuss the area above the waist. The most important thing about passing the football is the release. I will ask those of you in the audience this question: Did anyone ever show you how to throw the football? Raise your hand if someone taught you how to throw the ball. You were lucky! I run quarterback camps. I see over 1000 quarterbacks. I am going to tell you something, men. Those quarterbacks had no idea what I was talking about. Most coaches teach their quarterbacks the X's and O's, and they teach them how to read defenses, but they never show them how to play quarterback.

I want to talk to you about five major points involved in the release of the football. We start on this when the quarterbacks are in the fourth grade. I do not want them to get screwed up when they get to the high school level. It is too late to change their release at that age. If you get them early, you can teach this.

First, we get them in a pre-throwing position. Step one: We want the ball in a trigger position. The ball is between the earlobe and the armpit. I do not want it away from his body; I want it here along and parallel to his chest. We call step one the 
triggerposition.

Step two is to release the ball at the top of his throwing circle. If we took a hula hoop and placed it in front of the player, it would form his throwing circle. We want the player to release the ball at the top of that circle. This is how you develop overhand releases. We do not want a sidearm quarterback. We want him to release it at the top of the throwing circle. You have to have a slight bend in the elbow because you cannot throw the ball with a stiff arm. We do not want a javelin thrower for a quarterback. We want to keep the elbow at a right angle or perhaps at a little less than a right angle. If you raise your arm up and bend your elbow, you will be at the top of your throwing circle.

Step three and step four go together. Step three is transferring the weight from the back foot to the front foot. It is a short step. We do not want to overstride. It is a transfer-of-the-weight step. We want you to get your hips into the step. As you transfer your weight, the ball is going on the top of the throwing circle. You are stepping and hitting that circle all together. As you transfer the weight, you follow through. You should aim your belly button at your target. I want to bring the off arm down and back. Let me have the GAs demonstrate. Give me two guys over here and two over here. Just play pitch and catch with the ball. Not bad!

 





Page 36

Step five is this. As you throw the football, you bring the ball up to the top of the circle, bring the opposite arm down to break the plane of the back, and transfer the weight. As you bring the off arm down, your index finger is the last finger off the football. That should put your palm out of the way. If I throw the football, my palm should rotate inside and point away from my body. If the palm is turning over to the side where you can see the palm, you are sidearming the ball. That means you are turning your wrist. I promise you, if the index finger is the last finger off the ball, you will not break your wrist. As you come over the top of that circle, it is a perfect overhand throw.

We need to talk about a couple of side points here. Let me review the five major points of throwing a football: trigger position, top of the circle, transferring the weight, elbow breaking the plane of the back, palm turned away with the index finger off the ball.

Now consider a couple of other points. We emphasize this to our quarterbacks: ''We do not want you to patty-cake the football." A lot of quarterbacks pattycake the ball as they are holding it. I see them on TV. They patty-cake from the throwing hand to the offside hand-back and forth. Do you know what you are telling the defense when you patty-cake the football? Here it comes! If you do that against a good defensive secondary, they will pick you to death. You do not pat the football! If I see my quarterback pat the ball, he has to run a 40-yard sprint.

When you are standing up and have the football in the trigger position, it is a short release. Have you ever heard a coach talk about shortening the release of a quarterback? If the football is in the trigger position and you come to the top of the circle, you are shortening the release. One thing I take pride in with our quarterbacks is that they have a short release. They are not going to separate and have a big windup. One of the best releases in football is by Dan Marino.

I videotape all of our quarterbacks on their release. I tape other quarterbacks in college and the NFL as well. I am fascinated with the release of the football. I have the kids sit down and look at their release. I show the quarterbacks on the video in slow motion. Some of my players think they are movie stars. I go over the release with each of them, and then I tell them what they need to work on.

Question: What drills do you use to help with the release? We have a couple of drills that we use that I want to discuss with you. We have a drill that we call the rope drill. [Demo] We have the player bring the ball to the top of his circle and have him stop at that point. We take a rope and tie it over his wrist and have another player hold the rope. We make the quarterback throw the ball over the top of the rope. We want them to pretend the rope is not there. Some kids get obsessed with that rope. We tell them not to worry about it. We want them to throw through the rope. It is not going to hurt anyone. We have taken care of sidearm quarterbacks with this drill. We get some kids who want to come under the rope on their release. The rope drill will help them get the ball to the top of the circle. I have seen other coaches who use a volleyball net to force the quarterback to release the ball over. Some coaches use a goal post for the drill. I use the rope because you get 100 feet of rope for two or three bucks. You can have them work on it in the offseason. This is especially good for your young kids. I love working with those young kids. They will listen to you. They are all eyes. If you can get them going in peewee football, you can teach them good habits.

We put the players in a circle and have them throw the ball over the rope to each other. [Demo] This is a coaching clinic, so we are going to correct the demonstrators. We want the throwing motion to be natural. What we do at our quarterback camp is to tape every kid when he first comes in. I see all kinds of techniques. Then I show them at the end of the camp, so they can see the progress they have made.

Next drill-we need two quarterbacks here and two over on the other side. Now we do the kneel-down drill. We start with one knee up. Everything is going to be the same. The ball is between the earlobe and the armpit. We still stress all of the points in the release. He still has the circle, he still releases, he brings the left or nonthrowing arm down, and he comes off with the index finger last. They play pitch and catch with each other. Next we go to two knees. It is the same

 





Page 37

thing. This time they pick the ball up and follow through. Everything is from the waist up.

Next, we stand up and put the throwing foot forward. If you are right-handed, we want to put the right foot forward. We have them pick the ball up and do the same as before. It is still from the waist up. We do not want them to use their legs yet. We want them to come to the top of the circle and stop. We want them to come over the top.

Let me bring you up to date at this point. There are five points in the release, and I gave you four drills to improve the release. There are other drills you can do. I have a lot of drills to use on this technique. I give our kids only five or six and have them work on those.

Next is 
footwork. 
Now we talk about the quarterback from the waist down. We are assuming your kids will soak all of that in so it becomes a habit with them. They must be able to do the drills naturally. Now footwork. We do what we call 
quarterback agilities. I 
have talked to the best quarterback coaches in the country. When I go to clinics, I look for different ideas. I pick the minds of the people I come in contact with. I want to know everything I can about quarterbacks. I share this with our kids, and I am sure it helps our kids. Paul Hackett will tell you that no matter what, footwork is the most important thing in being a quarterback. If your feet are not in the right position, you are not going to throw the ball properly. He is correct. Some kids have strong arms and throw the ball improperly, but they get away with it on the high school level. When you get up against a good team, they are not going to get away with it. It is just like a boxer. He can throw a good punch if he has a good stance. If you are a quarterback, you can throw a good pass if you are in a good stance and your feet are in the proper position. When quarterbacks are under pressure, they never get in the right throwing position. This is where footwork comes into play.

Here are some of the things we teach our kids. We work hard on this. Let me have our GAs come down here to demonstrate again. The first thing I want our quarterbacks to do is to learn how to run. A lot of kids do not know how to run as quarterbacks. We talk about an armpit-to-armpit motion. We run down the field in about three-quarters speed. As we come down the field, I want the ball to come from one armpit across to the other armpit. We want them to come out nice and easy and transfer the ball back and forth. We want the ball up to the chin. Some players will get a little stiff when they run this drill. We do not want too much sway in the motion. It should just come naturally. It is a natural motion armpit to armpit.

The next thing we teach them is run backward, looking over the nonthrowing shoulder. If they are right handed, they should look over the left shoulder. They are just going to run back, taking a crossover step. As they do this, their eyes are focusing down the field. We want them to run as fast as they can. We do not do the carioca. We do that later. We just want to run backward. Why run that drill? That is a quarterback agility. Some kids cannot turn their head around and move their legs at the same time. It is side vision. This is how I work on the drill. I want the quarterback to see from sideline to sideline. We have them put the chin down so they can see to both sides. Some players cannot put their chin down and run backward. You are coordinating all things together. If you start with the kids in the 7th and 8th grade, you can develop them to do this drill. If you want to develop a quarterback, work on this drill. Don't just tell the kid he is the quarterback and let him go on his own. Work with him. You have to work with them.

After he learns to run backward with his chin down, we have him turn the chin over his shoulder and run backwards. Then we have him turn the chin to the opposite shoulder. Next we work on going back and switching the chin from one side to the other side. As they come backward, I will yell, "switch." They turn from the right side to the left side. They turn the chin and switch. As they are doing this, I want the ball in the trigger position. I want the chin tucked and the head on a swivel. The head stays the same, men. The head stays the same. Now, we do not have a lot of room here, so I will have the GAs switch very fast. [Demo] They must be able to move. They are developing hip flexibility as they switch from one side to the other side. You cannot play football with your butt hole puckered up. You have to be cool and calm.

 





Page 38

We want the ball up high on the drop. If you have the ball down low, you tend to fumble the ball. If the ball is up high, you can tuck it away and run. If you do fumble, you have a chance to recover it.

Next, we go to the carioca drill. Now we cross the front foot over the back foot as we back up. It is front-back, front-back, front-back. This is how we work this drill. We work the drill across the field or along the sidelines. You want the kid to do the drill on a straight line. We want him to come back straight on the line. Do it on the sideline or on a line across the field. We may start out on a walk-through. Then we gradually speed it up. We may go to half speed and then to three-quarters speed. We want it nice and smooth. Your kids will develop agility to do this drill. In a week you would be surprised what the kids can do in this drill. This helps develop the feet.

Next is the backpedal drill. We want them on the front half of their shoes. It is just like a defensive back on the backpedal. Instead of pumping the arms, the quarterback has a football in his arms. We want the weight distributed over the front of the shoes on the toes. We are looking downfield as we backpedal.

We can take a rolled up towel, take the quarterback, and do the side-to-side drill for footwork. We want him to step 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, throw. Next we have the quarterback step forward and then backward. We have him step over the towel and then back over the towel. We have him working his feet over the towel.

I am running short on time, and I want to teach the drop step. We have covered the agilities to improve the quarterback's footwork. We have covered how to improve the upper body. Now we want to go to the drop step. I have not gone into details, and I have not covered the stance and snap. They only gave me one hour to cover this material. Damn, Earl, this is a threeday lecture, and you only gave me one hour. I am going fast because I assume most of you know about the stance and how to take a snap.

Now I want to teach you the proper steps in the drop back. We use a power step and two shuffle steps. We always talk about the power step. When you take the football from the center, the power step is a good drive step. On the first step we want to turn the toes on the lead foot at an angle. We want to turn the toes of the back foot toward the sideline. By pointing the second step toward the sideline, it will help the quarterback stop. I got that from Dave Roberts when he was at Notre Dame. He is now the head coach at Baylor University. The second and third steps should stop the quarterback. The feet are the width of the shoulders. The chin is down so they can see the field. We want to take the power step, then two shuffle steps, and then stop.

I am going to give you two more terms. Once we get back on our drop, we have two kinds of steps. First is the hit, and the second is the hitch. A hit step is one step and throw. When we three- and five-step drop, we want a hit step. That is a 1-2-3 step. That is a hit step. Step and throw. We have the ball up ready to throw. We can move the feet 1, 2, 3, and throw. That is a hit step. If we drop back seven steps, we can use what we call a hitch step. The quarterback can come back, set up, hitch step, step up, and make the throw. Some of the young quarterbacks use the hitch step. Why? Because they are too weak to throw the ball from the deep position. They have to step up to get anything on the ball.

Now, we make all of our quarterbacks lift weights. All of our quarterbacks can bench-press at least 300 pounds. If you are getting hit, you had better have a body that can take it. The stronger the quarterback, the quicker he is. If a kid is quick, he can control his body. You can control your body when you are stronger. You can go one step and two shuffle steps, and that would be the three-step drop. You can go three power steps and two shuffle steps, and that is the five-step drop. The seven-step drop is five power steps and two shuffle steps. We still want to keep in mind trigger position and five major points in the drop.

We run an evasion drill. After we teach them to drop back at five steps, we do what we call a cross drill. They go back five steps and stop, slide to the right, slide all the way back to the left, come back to the middle, then a three-step drop, and throw the ball. [Demo] When do we teach this drill? If the rush comes,

 





Page 39

we want them to have some agility to avoid the rush. We are teaching them to keep their eyes open. When they move, the ball stays in the trigger position. When they take the five-step drop and they see the rush coming up the middle, they step to the side and throw the ball. You must be able to do that. If the rush comes from the other side, they must be able to avoid them and make the play. You can improvise on the drills. We have all kind of drills we use to teach them to evade the rush.

There is a lot to playing quarterback. I have 10 decision-making drills. We use these drills to help them make their decisions. I have four camps in Pennsylvania. We work the hell out of the kids that come to our camp. We charge them $35 for an eight-hour day. I saw in the newspaper where Kerry Collins paid Bill Walsh $40,000 to straighten out his release. Damn, I could have saved him a lot of money. I could have done it for 35 bucks. Let me tell you, there is a lot to being a quarterback. Thank you.

The Role of the Head Coach

Louisiana State University

Thank you, gentlemen. It is great to be back here. We have been traveling, and we have been gone since Sunday morning. I coached at Colorado for nine years, and it was great. We won some football games, and I thought we had a great run. Our staff at Colorado was structured a little differently from my staff at LSU. One of the differences was that not everyone on the staff at CU had a piece of the state to recruit. The recruiting at CU was something special to me. I like to travel the state and meet people. It had an impact on me. When I went to LSU, I divided the state up into nine areas. The year doesn't go by when at least one of our coaches will be in every high school in the state of Louisiana. I have been to every high school in the state. I go every spring. One spring I drove 9000 miles and never left the state. Actually I had a GA driving me, but I was in the car. My experience at CU had a lot to do with that.

I have an appreciation about what you do and how you do it. I don't think it changes much from state to state. I admire what you coaches do. I think the state university has an obligation to the high school coaches in their state. Really, it is an obligation to the high school athletes. That goes for all athletes, not just the ones we recruit.

When I left Colorado, I was the offensive coordinator. We ran what everyone called the "I-bone." I was very much involved with the offense and called the plays. When I went to Vanderbilt, it was my first head coaching experience. It was a lot like a military school. We did things the way the Air Force did. I felt the option offense was the way to go. I felt as if I was an expert with the option offense. We implemented the "I-bone" at Vandy, and I coached it. In fact, the last year I was at Vandy, which was 1994,1 coached the quarterbacks, called the plays, and was the head coach.

When I got to LSU, I didn't want to do that. I thought it would hurt us in recruiting, and it wasn't the way we could do our best. Our personnel didn't fit the option, so I got away from it. The reason I mention that is because of what I am going to talk about today. I am going to talk about what I do. It is not the X's and O's part. I am pretty far removed from that part of the game. I've gone from one extreme to the other. Two years ago I was coaching the quarterbacks and calling the plays. Now my job is much different. What I want to present to you today is how I've spent my year.

I could stand up here and be an expert on LSU's offense. I couldn't stand up here and tell you about our defense. I could tell you what we are doing. But if I had to talk on the offense or defense, I would have brought along our two coordinators. What I want to share with you is what I think I am an expert on. I want to tell you how I motivate my staff and players. I'm glad my topic in the program is Tiger football. I spoke at the Nike Clinic in Dallas, and my topic was defensive football. I never intended to speak on that subject. That was a joke. We gave up a bunch of points against Florida the week they called to get my topic. I was joking when I said defense. But, what I'm going to talk about today is what I do.

I'm going to take you through the yearly calendar. I'm going to start in July when the staff come back and start to get together in preparation for the season. I believe that as a head coach I have an obligation and responsibility to set the pace, tempo, and motivate the rest of the coaches. They all generally go on vacation in July. When they come back, I give them a book. The book has everything we are going to do between the first meeting and when our players return. That is a 10- to 14-day period. I always try to pick out some kind of theme that applies to the upcoming season.

When we took over at LSU, they had lost for six straight years. We took over in 1995 and won seven games and went to a bowl game. Everyone thought the program was turning around. This was not the coaches

 





Page 41

and players, but the fans. But the program really wasn't. My chief concern was how to keep the momentum going. That was the theme I brought to the coaching staff. If you are trying to turn a losing program around, your real problems come the second year, after having some success the first year.

That first year when you take over as a coach, everyone really buys into what you are preaching. You sell the team and that the team is the most important thing. In the second year, I believe that human nature takes over, and the team starts to get more individualistic. Some guys began to think that ''the team is winning, but I'm not playing." Those selfish attitudes can crop up and start to wear on a team. Going into the 1996 season, I studied a lot of second-year programs. I got a lot of media guides of all the major colleges through the years. I looked at the coaching changes. I looked at the first year where they had some success, but the second year was worse than the first. I was really concerned about that.

I think that there is a psychology about being involved in a second-year program. I want to share some of my staff agenda with you. I'm not going to cover all of it, but there are some highlights. I think these things are critical to our program. The first thing on the agenda is a senior barbecue. I'll come back to this a little later, because I think there is so much to be said about senior leadership, how you lead them, and how you teach them to lead. The first year that I was head coach at LSU, I found myself constantly talking about leadership. While you are traveling, you have a lot of time to think. I wondered how much these kids knew about leadership. I assumed that someone had taught them how to be a leader. You can't do that.

I have a player council. I started this when I was at Vanderbilt. I have two players from each class. I have the classes vote for them privately; I'm not there when they vote. I meet with the council periodically. Sometimes I take them to breakfast, and sometimes we meet in my office. They have a voice, but they don't have authority. They don't tell me who to play, what to run, or how to run the team. They are going to tell me things that the head coach would have no way of knowing. I have no idea what it is like being a student at LSU. I have no way of knowing what is served at the bars or how many drugs are around. I make a decision to learn about it or not to learn about it.

Every other week we meet as a council. I always go with an agenda. There are certain things I want to know about, so I ask them. They tell me. After that I turn the floor over to them. They have come up with some good things. If you let them talk, they will make your program better. I always ask our strength coach who the five best and five worst players are in the weight room. I like to go into camp knowing who has had a good summer and who has had a bad one. As it worked out, the five best in August in weights had outstanding years for us. Of the five worst, one left the team before camp, one didn't finish the season, one I threw off the team, and two didn't play at all. I was alerted before the season started that these guys weren't going to come into camp and all of a sudden have great work ethics.

After we go through personnel as a staff, we go to organization. I think it is tremendously important that you go through organization with your coaches. I think you have an obligation to them to discuss it. I'm going into my seventh year as a head coach. I've got five guys on my staff who have been with me for those seven years. There are certain things that shouldn't take the amount of time that it took seven years ago. I come from the Michigan school, because I was with Coach Bill McCartney for nine years. If you didn't get there at 4:30 in the morning and leave at midnight, you were a lousy coach. There is something to seeing how you are using your time. It is something for a new staff member, his wife, and his family not to be surprised by how much he is going to work or how little he is going to work. I think you owe that to your staff. I've always reviewed with them our work week and our work format.

I schedule situation scrimmages, such as goal line, short yardage, our pass protection, and other problems we are having. I took the things that hurt us the most during the season in 1995 as the guidelines for the situation scrimmages. We were very average in short yardage, goal line, throwing the ball when we had pressure on us, and the two-minute drill. Rather than get into a big philosophical discussion with the

 





Page 42

offensive and defensive coordinators, I went into the meeting and told them we were going to situation-scrimmage those thing early in camp. Now, the coordinators know these things are coming the first or second day we are in camp, and they can prepare their practice schedules accordingly. It is not up for discussion. This is what we are going to do.

The next thing is the "iso-camera." This is something we use for motivation. It is a little off the wall. At Vanderbilt, the first year we played Alabama, we played absolutely awfully. When the captain of the team came to see me, I asked him why we played so awfully. Alabama may have been a better team, but we played just terribly. He told me that most of the team was scared. I couldn't believe that. I said, "Most of our guys were afraid?" He said most of the people in our program were afraid of Alabama. I didn't know what to do. We played a couple of other games, and then came Auburn. That year Auburn was as physical and as tough as any team I've ever seen. They would knock you sideways. I said to myself, ''If we were afraid of Alabama, what would we do against Auburn? This could be awful." When I was in the hotel before the game, I had an idea. We were taking a wide-angle shot, an end-zone shot, and a tight sideline shot. I got to thinking about this iso-camera. I got in front of the team and talked about being intimidated. I told them I had written out a script from 1 through 75. Every play we are out there, that camera is going to be focused on one person. If you chicken out at all, I'm going to show this video and show everybody that you are a chicken. We played like hell. We got beat 24-22 and missed a field goal on the last play of the game for the win. That gave our kids great confidence. From that time on, it became part of our program.

What we do now in practice is this. I've got a walkie-talkie on my belt. I can talk to the cameraman in the tower. I can tell him who to zoom in on. It doesn't matter whether we shot anybody or not. All they have to do is to believe the camera is on them.

We have drug testing. I don't know how you feel about it, but I think it is something we have to address. We address drug abuse a lot and test a lot. We want to help our kids to stay clean. It may remind you of police-state tactics, but I think it is the best thing for them. When they get older, they understand why we do it. I think that as educators and coaches we have to get involved in this. How you would do something like this is beyond me, but we all have to get involved.

We always study our first four opponents in the summer. It wouldn't matter to me what level I was coaching on. I would assign one assistant coach on each side of the ball to study one of your first four opponents. That would become his team. He would be responsible for putting together a book on that team. We open up the season with Texas, El Paso, at home. We've never played them before. The second game is Mississippi State at State. We play them every year. Then we play Auburn at home. We play them every year. We have a coach on each side of the ball to study those opponents. It gives one guy a lot of responsibility. He can spend a lot of time on that team so that everyone doesn't have to. If you have Mississippi State or Auburn, who we play year in and year out, they become experts on them. You will know much more about your first two or three opponents if you have studied them all summer. I think this gives you an edge at any level. You don't have that time to do it once your regular season starts.

Every coach in our program has to have a position training tape. When the defensive line coach talks to his players about a 1 or 3 technique, he has some game video cut-ups. On these videos are the things he has been talking about. They show our players using the proper techniques in a game situation. We meet with our kids for an hour. If you are on our staff, you better be a good teacher. You have to be entertaining and well prepared. I don't want them lecturing to a group for an hour. I want to see excellent tapes. I don't want to see some two-year-old videos. Position tapes are ways that coaches can study the game. I want my coaches to be students of the game.

I want our coordinators to put any gadget play in early. I tell our offensive coordinator that I want a reverse or throw-back in the first two or three days of camp. I want to do it first to the defense and second so our offense can execute it.

 





Page 43

One neglected area of offensive football is 
cadence. I 
don't think any of us change up enough. I have charted it. I have had a GA in charge of it. I think that as offensive coaches we get into a rut. I am willing to bet that 95 percent of the people in this room, myself included, do not use the cadence to our advantage. The thing in college football today is pressure defense. With all the pressure defenses we are seeing, for our offensive football team not to change the cadence is not smart. The problem is when you decide to try to change your cadence. You go out to practice, and your kids are jumping offside every time you try to change. You yell at the kids, get frustrated, and stop trying to do it. You have to make a commitment to it. We try to commit to it every year, get frustrated, and stop. Each year the point keeps getting pushed back further.

Our coaches are visiting other programs this week. We have coaches going to Florida State. We have some in Indianapolis to visit the Colts organization. There are some at North Carolina. All our coaches at LSU are out visiting this weekend. They will all come back with a million ideas. They all will want to put something in. I won't let them put anything in until they take something out. You can't keep adding on to football. It is not fair to the kids. We don't have them all day long. If you follow the rule, you only have 17 hours a week. You have to count three hours for the game. It all has to do with time. If you go to a pro camp, they all have the great big packages. They also have the kids all day long. We don't have that. I give our coaches a free rein. If they want to add something, they have to take something out.

In our staff agenda, which we started in July, one coach is responsible for the opponent's cadence. I assign a coachand it doesn't have to be a defensive coachto come up with our opponent's cadence. We are not allowed to live-scout any more, but I still want to know that cadence. I have a list of our opponents up on the wall. I put the name of one of our assistants next to each team. I don't care how they get it. I know the rules, but come that assistant's week, he better have the cadence, or he better make something up and hope I don't know it. When you play the same teams year in and year out, you make notes on the cadence. That is part of the way to get prepared on defense. The next thing is tackling drills. We practice tackling every day. I remember listening to Bo Schembechler when I was an assistant coach. He told the story about this defensive coordinator who was delivering a lecture on defense. He had the more up-to-date coverages, knew all the buzzwords about defense, and really looked the role. At the end of his presentation, a guy in the back asked a question. He said that he was impressed by the presentation but noticed that his team was last in the conference on defense. His comment was that they just couldn't tackle. Well that is defense. Defense is about tackling. If we don't have time to practice tackling, we have too big a game plan.

Let me cover the kicking game very quickly. Your approach to the kicking game is very important. There is a principle in leadership called 
ownership. 
I think that head coaches are the owners, and assistant coaches are the renters. I remember when I rented an apartment when I couldn't afford a house. If I put a dent in the wall, all I did was pay a $10 damage fee. When I bought my first house, if someone brushed against the wall, I went bananas because I owned the house. Who owns and who cares about the kicking game? High-profile, well-paid assistant coaches put their names on offenses and defenses. But who the hell owns the kicking game? I don't believe you just go out there and coach the kicker. Someone has to own the team. They have to be responsible for that team. It could be a special-teams coach. Ownership brings more accountability.

In the fall I give every assistant a sheet that details his total responsibility to the team. Every guy on the staff knows every responsibility he has. If a coach is responsible for the field equipment, I don't want any surprises come practice time.

I am in charge of squad letters. If you don't write letters to your squad, you're missing a chance to motivate. I write a letter a week to our team, and I write a personal note on the bottom of that letter. I have our coaches write once a week to our kids. I get a copy of that letter before it goes out. When our players get home, they have a letter from me and one from an assistant coach. I give my coaches the right

 





Page 44

to be creative and talk about what they want to. It is a great motivational tool.

In August every coach on the staff will give a clinic to the rest of the staff in our first meeting. I don't care how long we have been together as a staff. This is an old Michigan tradition. Hal Hunter is our offensive line coach. He will deliver a clinic to the staff as if he were talking to his players. He has 60 minutes to show everyone on that staff what he is going to show his position group. During that 60 minutes he will show us his training video. Every teacher has a different teaching method. That is all coaching is. Our coaches expose the methods they use to the rest of the staff. They can learn from each other different methods of teaching. When a guy joins your staff, it sets a standard for him. If I have a new guy on my staff, I never let him go first. We usually make him go last. These are grown men, professionals. After eight of those assistant coaches have gone and it becomes the new guy's time, he is puckered. He wants to do a good job. He wants to be a head coach, just like those other guys. There is pressure, but it is a great experience. When was the last time you hired a coach and didn't hear him teach? We do it all the time. We have no idea what he is telling those players. I get around now since I don't coach a position. I can tell whether a guy is doing a good job or not. I can tell if he is honest with them, whether they are listening, and if he is going too long.

I have a senior barbecue at my house for our seniors. This is a leadership clinic for them. I want to talk to them about how they see their leadership roles on the team.

The last game I coached at Vandy we lost 55-0. The reason I got the LSU job was no one else would take it. It got late, and they had to give it to somebody. Six days before we played Texas A&M in 1995, we were going to practice on Sunday. Outside our locker room I saw this kid standing on the back of a pickup truck, and everyone else was standing around listening to him. I knew I had a problem. I called a team meeting and put up the practice schedule, which included a goal-line scrimmage because we weren't very good at it. They didn't think a scrimmage six days before a game was a good idea. They hadn't got to know me. At the end of the meeting, I asked if there were any questions. The captain stood up and told me they were not going to practice. They said I was working them too hard. I told them that this was LSU property. If they didn't want to practice, they could get the hell out of my room. They stayed, and we went out to practice. We had a very average practice. That night the captain was in my office. He is a great kid who is playing pro ball now. He told me he didn't agree with the demands, but he thought it was his job to represent their wishes. I told him that was not leadership. Leadership is not counting hands to see who wants to practice easy.

I teach a leadership class. I have 11 guys in it. I bring in other students, legislators, pro coaches, and others into the class to explain their definition of leadership. I don't keep them much longer than 40 minutes. The one thing I stress is, however you start out to lead, that is the way you finish. If you start out as a rah-rah guy on the first day, I better hear from you at midseason. Don't think you can change. Don't think when things go bad you can disappear. Give a guy a chance to not be a holler guy if he doesn't want to holler. Tell the rah-rah guy that if that is his style, that will be his style all year.

I give my kids a handout with typical problems. These are the things I want to discuss. Night activity is a dangerous time for athletes. I don't know where you went to college, but where I went, Thursday night was "get drunk night." If you get drunk two nights before you play Alabama, you will get your ass kicked. That is pretty simple. I'm not going to the bars to throw you out. Who is going to keep everyone out of the bars? Seniors have to make a decision about whether we are going out or not. They need to hold the rest of the team accountable. I make them tell me what they decided.

I don't believe in hazing of the freshmen. We are all one team, and there is no place for that type of thinking. The hazing has a tendency to separate and divide the team concept. I don't allow it to go on in our program.

I never liked the idea of game captains. That is the way it was done before. We have a lot of Louisiana guys on our squad. It has been an incredible honor to play in Tiger Stadium. But it was a bigger honor to serve as

 





Page 45

game captain in Tiger Stadium. I recognized that was another motivating tool, so I went along with that idea.

Always evaluate senior leadership on specific criteria. I started to develop a small questionnaire to evaluate leadership. Is the kid a starter? Is he well liked? Does he practice well? How did he report to camp? Did he pass the conditioning test? I think he should have a personal record on his conditioning test. Why wouldn't a senior in his last year with a chance to play for his last SEC championship have a personal record? The 1997 season will be a challenge if most of our seniors who are coming back and going to play come back in worse condition than when they were juniors. I have a problem if that happens. I better address that right away.

Let me cover these thoughts quickly before I run out of time: (1) Always play someone if you promised to. At Colorado, one of our coaches promised a kid that he would play in the game regardless of what the score was. We said he was going to play, and we didn't play him. (2) Always be yourself. (3) Always teach team. (4) Try to be the most physical team. (5) Work on blocking and tackling. (6) Be able to run the football. (7) Practice situations. (8) Always videotape practices and games.

The last thing I have is "always script practice." Thursday was the toughest day for me as offensive coordinator when I was at Colorado. That was the short practice. I couldn't practice every situation. I made up a form that has every possible situation. It has 100 plays on it. It has everything that could possibly happen to you during the course of a gameor for a season, for that matter. Most of the plays didn't have to be rehearsed on Thursday. All it did was to organize my thinking. That is so that if I need a certain situation to go over on Thursday, I have it. The other type of script was the game rehearsal we had before the first game. It had a kickoff after a safety and overtime games. We used that every preseason, right before the opening game.

I believe that when we play flat, that is my fault. I take that responsibility. I hold the offensive coordinator responsible for the offense and the defensive coordinator responsible for the defense. I hold myself responsible for the emotion and motivation of our team.

On Sunday I meet with the team and review their play in the game. I meet with each unit and tell them what they did badly first and what they did well second. I meet with the offense, defense, and kicking team. I know everything that is going on. I just met with their coaches, and they told me what was going on. Having the presence of the head coach and the knowledge gives them confidence.

Monday is an off day for us. Tuesday is our scouting-report day. We try to be as honest as we can. We don't run guys down who our people will be playing against. We don't overrate the team. This is a motivating atmosphere. We are trying to get our people ready to play.

On Wednesday I meet with them as a team. We come together after practice, and I'll say something to them. On Thursday I have a prepractice meeting to go over the practice plan. There is no screwing around on Thursday. We are not a loosey-goosey outfit. We want no one who is not going to play grab-assing around. You can have as much fun as you want on Tuesday or Wednesday, but Thursday is a very serious day. After practice I meet with the team without any assistants there. It is strictly motivation about the game. On Friday we are very unemotional and technical. I want every coach to go through the game plan. I want it to be really focused, with absolutely no screwing around. I didn't let two kids play this year because they were a minute late. We won both games. Saturday is game day. We generally play at night. I get my last chance at the team in the cafeteria before we eat the pregame meal.

Gentlemen, I got about half way through, but I have to catch a flight. I enjoyed saying hello to some of you guys who came by. I wish I could stick around. It was great being here, and I hope everyone has a great season. Thanks.

The Passing Attack In The Red Zone

University Of Georgia

When you go to a clinic, it is good to talk to other people and share ideas. It is good to talk about your program and their program as far as what is going on. Most of you have a good idea of what you want to do on both sides of the ball, or you would not be coaching. It is good to have a good sense of direction.

It is also important to know that the game changes, and you have to keep up with what happens in football. You have to keep up with the rule changes and use them to your advantage. I think it is important as a coach, regardless of the level you are on, to be objective and coachable, to branch out and get new ideas.

I am not the type of coach who would get up here and preach to you. There are a lot of things we can do better. Last year we were not a very good football team. We had flashes of being a good team, but when you make changes in football, it is difficult to get things across. Hopefully, we will be able to do a better job next year. You must be able to articulate what you are doing to the players. The bottom line is, How are they going to do when the band plays on Friday night at 7:30? Basically, it gets down to what they can handle. As college coaches, we spend a lot of time watching other schools. We have two of the top teams in the country in our division of our league. We have some lofty goals to reach just to be competitive. I am sure it is the same for you.

The point I want to make is this. We want to analyze our past season. That is what we are doing now. We know what won for us last season. We also know what got us beat. As situations develop during the course of the season, the quicker your team learns how to adjust to those situations that won for you and got you beat, the better a team you will be next year. It does not matter if you have a lot of players back or not. You can reflect to them and point out what happened and how the team reacted to those situations.

For instance, our team handled overtime situations very well. They showed a lot of poise and did a great job of handling what we needed to do to win the game. Ten of the 11 games we played last year were decided in the last five minutes. This includes the Tennessee game, where we were inside their 20-yard line and were behind 10 points. We have a lot of games that are decided by certain situations and how the team reacts to them. I want to make sure that I emphasize to you, as teachers of the game and coaches, that we are dealing with kids a lot younger than we are.

One thing I learned when I was coaching at Oklahoma with Barry Switzer was the mind-set of the players. No matter what happened in those situations, we expected to win. We counted on that. When I took over at Marshall University, it was the same. I am not sure that our kids have that mind-set yet. A lot of that is based on success or the lack of success. Some of the other teams we played, we felt, had an idea that they were going to lose to us. When it starts getting tough, teams are going to lose games more than they are going to win games. Teams start making mistakes, and it causes them to lose.

From a skilled level, it does not matter if you want to run a three-back set, a two-back set, or a one-back set. It is immaterial to me today. Formations do not win for you. What wins for you are the players. Some of you are really good coaches one year, and the next year you are not quite as good because you do not have those good players. Sometimes egos get in the way.

You need to develop something good, regardless of what you do. You have to be able to take advantage of what the defense gives you. In the collegiate game today, with all of the multiple defenses and fronts and defensive coverages, it becomes a real guessing game for us. I do not like to guess. On any decision I have to make, I want to eliminate as many risks as I can in trying to be successful. If you are spending a lot of time

trying to outguess your opponent, it can get in your way a lot of the time.

I know this: "Coaching will not win for you, but it will get you beat." That is a profound statement. What I am saying is this. If we are playing against Tom Osborne or Jimmy Johnson or whoever, we better be ready to play. I will assure you that their team will be ready. We are not going to outcoach them. Their players will be just as well prepared as our players. But if you do not do everything they do, then that will get you beat.

Some coaches think they can come up with magic on Friday night at 7:30 that is going to make them win. I do not believe that is going to happen too often. Basically, you will have to make a few adjustments along the way. The teams that are constantly changing and trying to get a sense of direction and do not have a feel for what they are doing have players who do not have a lot of confidence about what is going on. If you change what you are doing every Monday, it becomes hard to believe in. Have a system and believe in it and make it work.

I have been involved with some good quarterbacks, and I have been involved with staff members who helped make them good quarterbacks. I really believe that one of the real key issues, beside the fact that they had good arm strength, is their decision-making ability. It is not just having the ability to do the right thing, but making sure they do not do the wrong thing. A lot of times, players with pressure on them cannot react properly. A lot of times in high school, the best athlete in the school is the quarterback. You need a player who the players have a lot of confidence in.

I do want to cover a couple of other things about handling your quarterback. I think it is critical that you coach all of them, regardless of age. The reason I say that is because one of these days that freshman is going to be a senior. You have to find time to coach that player as much as you do the other players. That is hard to do, I will promise you. Too many times coaches get involved with play polishing, and they are only involved with one group. I would rather have four groups alternating and coach them on the run than have three of the teams just standing and watching everyone else. When they do not know what to do, it is hard to get much accomplished. I think it is important to coach them all and to meet with them all. Have them in your meetings. Learn what it takes to make them tick.

You cannot find out what a player can do by talking to him on Friday night if you do not talk to him all week. We have a rule that if we are in a staff meeting and a player comes over to see a coach, we are going to leave the meeting and talk with him. It does not matter. I know what I can do. You had better make sure the quarterback can accomplish what you want. Over the years, the thing that has been successful for us has been the fact that we have given a lot of meeting time and practice time during the individual period to everyone. Now, you get into the team situation, and it is different. You are not going to be able to work three and four groups. But it is important for players to understand your system and to come along. You would be surprised at how some of these men can play when they are given the chance. My philosophy is to coach them all. Give them all a chance to learn what is going on with the individuals.

What we are going to talk about today is "attacking the red zone." We are referring to the area from the 20-yard line to the goal line going in. When you get the ball inside the 20-yard line by running the ball, it is hard to get away from what you are doing, and they start throwing it. The same is true if you pass the ball down to the 20-yard line and then start running the ball. Our basic philosophy is this. Whatever got us down there is probably what we are going to continue with. If we are playing a team that has been knocking the crap out of us and then we get down to the 20-yard line, we are not going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out which running plays will go. We know that all of a sudden we are not going to become Ben-Hur. Do you know what I am saying? By the same token, if we get down there by throwing the ball, we are not going to change just to be changing.

Regardless of the system you use, there are a few obvious things you need to consider inside the 20-yard ine. The other team is going to start taking more chances. They have not stopped you in 80 yards; what

 





Page 48

makes you think they are going to stop you now? The defense is going to take more risk than before. You must be prepared for these risks. The better you can take care of those risks, the better it is for your offense. We sell our receivers, just like everyone else, that we play all year to get a one-on-one situation. "Now you are going to have it for sure."

The difference in college football now and, say, five years ago is the fact that teams now are playing a lot more press coverage. They are playing more of a sic 'em type defense than it used to be. An example of that is Nebraska. Two of the last three years, they have won the national championship. They went from the completely zone, high-tech read, straight-up eagle defense to now a 4-3 defense with the Mike and Will linebackers walked up tight. They move them in and out. They bump and run on the corners. It is like everything in football. When you win as Nebraska has, everyone starts copying them. A lot of other teams are using what Nebraska does. You can run that defense if you have corners outside that can cover one on one on the perimeter.

We feel that we know what the defense is going to do once we get to the red zone now. Conversely, some teams have gotten to the point where they play more zone coverage in the red zone. They just make you beat them. If you have not scored a lot of points on them, they may play seven across on 3rd and 5 on the 5-yard line and rush four men. All of that is hypothetical that we could get into. You could say what you run, and I could tell you what I run. I am not into those aspects. I am not going to get into that today. All I am going to talk about is some philosophy of using some routes that are multifaceted that will take care of some different things.

We want to make sure our quarterback and receivers are on the same page. Our quarterback coach and receivers coach work a lot of time together against air. We are going to have to read what the defense is doing. You cannot come in after playing in front of 87,000 fans and have the receiver say, "I thought the free safety was playing cover two." The quarterback says, "I thought he was playing bump and run, man." That is when everyone wants to know who is the damn coach? That is not going to get the job done. You are looking for results. The way you do that is to coach them up hard, and basically it gets down to this: Estimate the defense's intent. What can he play from the alignment he is in? You hear a lot about teams disguising their coverage. Let me tell you something. When the band is playing on Friday night and the offense is knocking on the goal line, they are not going to be disguising anything. The are going to be covering as best as they can. If they can do a lot of fancy things on the goal line, that is great for them. To me this is just a lot of clinic talk. ''I want you to line up in an outside shade, then jump inside, and on the snap I want you to come up, then make sure you play cover two." Hey, do you think that kid is thinking about all of that? He is thinking about that war daddy running right past his butt. You have to be careful about giving the other team too much credit. The question we want to ask is this: What can they do from the way they line up? We try to react from that point on.

What we would like to do, to keep from adjusting any more than we have to, is to eliminate a possible bad play. It is like I said about taking a risk. We want to make sure we are on the same page.

The bottom line would be for you to come to our practices this spring, and we could show you what we do. We run what we call a "man-zone read." If they are playing man coverage, we are going to do 
this. 
If they are playing zone coverage, we are going to do 
that. 
This is particular with the inside receiver, whether it is the tight end in the two-wide-receiver offense or the slot in a three-wide-receiver set. We are going to run some type of read route based on the coverage. If the defense is in a three-deep coverage and we have a man coming down the field, he will continue to try to split the middle to work on that area. If it is against a three-deep and the safety is deep, the receiver will hook up. We do not want to run into a three-deep.

If the receiver is running what we call a shallow route, which is a short crossing route, and he sees man coverage, he drives up the field one more step, he gets

 





Page 49

the defender on his hip pocket, and he keeps coming on across. If he sees the zone, he will just hook up. We do not want to leave an area where we are open just to find another open spot. This is very easy to do, as long as you do not have a lot of people doing it. You do not need two or three players adjusting the routes all of the time. We feel that with combination coverage that we get with all of the different reads we see, we need someone working some type of man-zone read all of the time. It may be the receiver in the middle; it may be the running back or a lot of other people.

I do not think it makes any difference what we call these plays, because I do not have time to go over our numbering system except to tell you this. Our first digit is to the single-receiver side on the weak side. Our second digit is the middle receiver, and the third digit is for the strong-side receiver. We add a word for flare control to both sides. The first thing we say in our system is the protection. The reason we do thisregardless of the formation we are in or the grouping we have, as we could have two, three, or four wide receiversis because it gives us a multiple offense. All the receiver needs to know is whether he is the first, second, or third number and the flare control word.

I am going to cover a basic route that anyone here could run, regardless of the type of formation you base out of. What we are doing here is giving the outside receivers the ability to convert their routes. If we face some type of soft zone coverage, we are going to run a five-step hitch-type route. We use three-step protection with the quarterback. He is going to know that he has the inside people taken care of if they have underneath coverage on the outside men. It is obvious that if the corner comes up and plays bump and run on the outside receiver, he will convert his route to the fade route. I know you got to see Florida play a lot this year. Danny Wuerffel was the best I have seen at throwing the fade route. They had great receivers and a large number of completions on that play. Everyone played the receivers, hoping that Danny was going to have a bad day. He only had one bad day, and that was when Florida State sacked him so much.

The fade route is tough to complete. All things must go well for the play to work. You can have the perfect pass and have the defensive back knock it down. As our quarterback comes out of the huddle, the first thing he does is to figure out to which side he has the least amount of coverage.

FLEX RIGHTQUICK 181 STOP/BLOCK

The quarterback reads and works the strong side primarily. If you get straight man, the "80" will have a run-through, and the outside routes will convert to fade routes.

We would like to throw the hitch route here if we can. If we feel we have a mismatch on the outside and they are playing bump and run, then we will throw the fade route. The idea is this: If we are in the plus-20 area, we have a chance to have a completion, avoid the sack, and make some yardage.

Usually when we run this play, it will be packaged with some type of run play. Most of you are familiar with the outside zone play. Some of you may call it the stretch play. Because we are in the one-back set, we may call "check slant or quick pass." If the defense walks up tight on the receivers, plays tight, and plays cover two, we may check off and run the slant play. We may just run the draw play. If they take the linebacker outside, we may run the draw. It depends on the basic philosophy, front-wise.

Most of the coaches here are knowledgeable. It does not make any difference if you are knowledgeable or not, the bottom line is win or lose. This is what you have to do. Coaches will say that they can only run one snap count, and we can't check plays off. Basically, that is what you do not want to do. If you

 





Page 50

want to do it, it is very simple to do it. I teach this to the quarterbacks in our camps. It is just a matter of telling the quarterback whether we are going to run the sweep to the right side; if the defense has more people on that side than we do, we want to run the play to the left side. If the defense has more people on the left side, we want to run it to the right side. That is basically the way we do it. We may call "check 48-49." We come up to the line and run it either way we want to.

Another thing I think you can help your quarterback with is this: Most quarterbacks do not have a good system of coming up to the line of scrimmage. They get in the huddle and call the play: "46 on 2; ready, break." The quarterback comes out of the huddle with his head down and walks up to the line that way. They come up to the line and do not get their head up. What does that do for the other team? That quarterback does not show much confidence. We want the quarterback to get a definite process of looking weak to strong, strong to weak, or left to right. We see some quarterbacks break the huddle and start looking toward the area where they are going to throw the ball on each play. We want a definite process of coming to the line.

This is a simple play, but if you can package it with a running play, it not only gives you a chance to be an aggressive football team, but it is a high-percentage throw for the quarterback. It is easy to complete if the defense gives you some zone-type look. If it is two-deep or bump and run, we convert the outside receivers to the fade route.

A lot of teams that you see playing two-deep coverage are going to sink their corners pretty well. They know they have the safeties behind them. They will let you throw the ball in front of them and then break on the football. Teams used to try to jam the wide receivers inside. If the defense gives us a cushion, we will still try to throw the hitch route inside.

I want to talk about another route that we got from the pros a couple of years ago. The reason we like this play is this: On the same routes that we run off our five steps, we wanted to be able to protect the quarterback against a good defensive front and still be able to run our best routes. We take the double-in; some people call it a dig route, but we are running it off the three-step drop. You could run this off any formation. We are going to slide our protection, so we could take care of anything on the weak side. As long as the defense rushes seven men, we are OK. We have everyone assigned to someone.

TWINS RIGHTQUICK-SLIDE ROUTE 166 BLACK/SEAM

On the weak side we are going to run the same route that we ran on 181. We run the hitch on the back side. If they play two-deep, we are going to convert it to a fade route. Otherwise, we have a cinch hitch route that we can throw if the quarterback comes out and sees three-deep and does not like what he sees to the field side. That is not tough. He is going to run his three-step drop.

One thing we try to do with our quarterbacks when we are throwing to the left is this: We come out and put a lot of weight on the left instep. The reason for that is because we want the knees in a little. When you turn your body, you have a good pivot on the first step. When we take the second step, we start the pivot right now and then we throw the ball. We do not like to go back, 1, 2, 3, and then turn. We like to turn on the second step when we are throwing to the left.

We want the quarterback to find the throwing lane. He throws to the backside number. The bigger target you aim at, the more you are going to miss. We like to aim at a small target. If we are throwing an inside route, we like to throw at the receiver's teeth. If we miss his teeth, we hope to hit his head. If you can hit him in the head, you have a lot that can happen. Pick small targets. Don't just say, "Hit him in the numbers."

 





Page 51

One thing that irritates me is to have a player drop the pass and have a coach yell, ''Catch the ball." Why tell him that? 
Why 
did he drop the pass? Not every good athlete in your program has good hands to start out with. You have to work on their hands. Work on their depth perception. One of the first things you do is to take them to the optometrist. Many kids have poor eyes and have not had their vision checked. Work with them on depth perception. One thing you can do is to work with them on their hands. Work with them individually. A lot of kids lack confidence so much that they get nervous when they are in a group setting and drop a lot of passes. If you have a really good athlete who needs to work on his hands, then get him out on the field and work with him individually. Move the ball around, and make him catch the ball. Teach him to use his hands in relation to his eyes.

On the strong side against the trips look, very seldom do we get a team that will bring a linebacker outside and up close and play us with two deep. If they do, we are going to run the stretch play. If they stay in a conventional look, they will probably be in a threedeep look. This is a simple read.

We have more trouble throwing a slant route than we do the in route. If you just think about it, you will see that it makes sense. If you look at the man coming inside and squaring his body up as compared to a receiver coming in on the slant at a sharp angle, it is easier to throw the inroute. What are we looking for? The high-percentage completions! Teams that throw the ball had better be able to complete 60 percent of them. If you throw the ball a lot, you had better be able to complete 65 percent of the passes. There is not anyone in here, even if you have an average team, who cannot average 4 yards per snap.

The point here is this: If you have a strong-side cover three, you need to send the tight end down the middle. If they are playing cover two, we want the tight end to keep the safeties back deep. Also, we want to keep the linebacker inside where we can do something outside.

Let me talk about cover three. We always look at the defenders' shoulders. Their shoulders will basically tell you what they are going to do. The more they open the shoulders, or the more they close their shoulders, you know where they are going. Look to see what the shoulders are telling you. We are going to take a threestep drop, and we are going to read the strong safety and see what he does. If he hangs back, we have a good split between the two wide receivers. They are running 6 yards apart, and they are running the in route. We throw the ball to the outside receiver. If he opens toward the field, we have a good throwing lane between the strong safety and the inside linebacker, unless they happen to drop the defensive end. Usually when they are playing cover three, the end on the other side is dropping. There is always something they can do differently, I promise you.

This is a good route for you if you are a team that throws a lot of square-ins to your outside receiver down the field and you are having problems with your protection. You can throw this as a three-step drop. You could run this out of three wide receivers and two backs. The inside receiver runs a hitch, and the outside man runs the square-in.

I want to move on to another route that we have had a lot of success with. The reason we have had success is this: What happens when you go up against a threedeep team and you are running three wide receivers? We would like to get four vertical on them. If they are in a three-deep and we send four men vertical, we end up with a two-on-one at one point. If we are running all four on what we call nine routes, we will be sending our receivers all the way down the field. If the free safety cheats to the tight-end side, we hit the split end. If he cheats to the split-end side, we hit the tight end.

FLEX RIGHTQUICK SLIDE LEFT 292 SEAM/BLOCK

 





Page 52

The quarterback reads the strong side first. He reads the defender over number 2. We run the slant or seam routes. What happens is that everyone will show you cover three and then rotate to cover two. You have four men going vertical, and the defense is stacked back there against you. This route was put in to use against teams that like to play cover two against four vertical. The second routes were routes that we like to run against teams that rushed the passer. That is where we like to run the double-in routes.

This route is used because we can't run four vertical because the defense is going to cover two. We are going to run the two men on the outside and make it look like they are going vertical. What did I say a minute ago about teams that play cover two now as compared to in past years? That is right. They are sinking back. If they are sinking back, we want to throw the ball in front of them. We are going to make them think we are running four vertical. It is OK if the two inside get in collisions. If the man on him collides with him, it will open up the throwing lane outside.

This is how our quarterback looks at the play. He gets his pre-snap read. It looks like the defense is going to be in cover two. He wants to see which defender has the best chance on the inside jam. We would prefer that we not get the collision on the inside men. We would like to stick the ball in deep if the safety is backing up. If the inside is covered, we look at the defender's shoulders. We look at the defender's shoulders and read him. If he jams the inside receiver, we throw the ball to the outside man on the 2 route. If he does not jam the man, we stick the ball to him. It is a 7- to 8-yard route. Sometimes they run for days on this route. This is one of the best evolutions of the three-step passing game. The reason is this: Before, we only had two or three routes we could run from the three-step drop passing game. Before, we could run the quick out, hitch, and slant routes. That was about it. Now we have two more plays that we can run here. The 292 pass is a great route for us. We can run the 166 play as well.

I am going to coach you up. See if you are with me. We are in a three-deep situation. We may try to go four vertical or throw the hitch to the outside. If the defense is in a two-deep, we are going to run some type of double-in or the 292 seam. The whole point is that we have all three of these routes that we can run at the quarterback's command.

I am going to coach you up on the next situation. We call, "Flex right, check draw, slant or quick pass." The quarterback comes up to the line, and it has a three-deep look. It is a balanced front. We are going to go 181. If we come up and the defense has everyone walked off and has a balanced front, we are going to run the stretch play to the tight end side. If they have everyone walked off, an unbalanced front, and the linebacker walked outside, we run the draw play strong. This is not hard. It is not a matter of me having the chalk. Those are three things we could do to run or pass the ball.

Now we come up, and the corners are playing off the wide receivers, and they are playing cover two. We do not want to run a desperate route; we will just run 292. It sounds good, doesn't it? It would sound a lot better if you could win some games with it. Do you understand? We have been used to doing this. We just have to get it across to our players. We got a lot better at moving the ball. The point is that you have to have a system in place.

In the early 1970s, I was coaching at the University of North Carolina. Part of my learning process as a coach was to go watch Dean Smith practice basketball. Ijust sat in the stands and watched him coach. Everyone in the building was 100 percent behind the system. It did not matter if it was Michael Jordan, a sub on the team, a manager, or whateverthey were 100 percent behind the system. There was not any doubt about it. They believed in it. To be a player or an assistant coach involved in part of the change of command, you have to believe in your leader and make sure you back him up to the hilt. When Dean Smith blew the whistle, everything stopped. When players were supposed to be some place, they were there. Sure Dean Smith recruits, but he coaches their butts off, men. He even coaches them when they get out of school. In all of the time he has been there, he has only had two players who did not graduate from college. 
Two 
of them! Both of them are making a lot more money than

 





Page 53

he does. The point I am making is this: Everything he does the kids are really sold on. If you expect your team to be good, you are going to do better.

Now we are going to the five-step principle. Now, this situation for the inside receivers is similar to what we had for the outside receivers. Earlier I talked to you about man-zone read. What this boils down to is this: We have a good idea of the type of coverage you will be in, based on the pre-snap estimate. But again, we are not sure. Normally, we call this route when we know the defense is getting ready to get after us hard. We have a man-zone read with the split end.

The first thing we do is to come up and check the wide receiver to the split-end side. We have a hitch route for him. If we get cover three, we run the weak-side hitch. We are thinking inside on the play. The reason we have the hitch set up is in case they have any kind of zone coverage. If the defense is playing man coverage, we have what we want inside with the second route.

The inside receiver runs what we call a shallow route. It is a shallow crossing route. Generally speaking, we should have a weaker cover man on us on this side. It could be the weak safety or the weak-side linebacker. He may not be as good as a player on the outside.

It is built into our system that we can change the split end and the wideout to that side. If we want to put another receiver into the game and put our best receiver in the split-end side, we can. We can interchange those two men.

DOUBLE RIGHTSLIDE LEFT 168 SHALLOW/WIDE

What is the split end looking for? A man-zone read. If he has a man on him, he gets the man in his hip pocket and continues across the field. He tries to outrun the man underneath him.

The tight end runs a deeper six route than he did on 166. He goes deeper because the quarterback takes a five-step drop. We would not run this play out of the shotgun, because we are going to hit the split end on the crossing route quickly. Some shotgun plays are better in the red zone than others.

The tight end comes down the field and reads the defense. If it is zone, he sits down inside. If it is man, he keeps coming deep. If we get the zone coverage, we end up with a high-low between the two ends. If it is man, we look to the weakest cover man, and most of the time it would be on the split end. If we feel that we have a good shot, we may go over the top and throw to the wide receiver on the post. If the free safety starts jumping the crossing route or they are doubling a receiver, we take a shot at the post route over the top. That would be based on the game plan and situations.

We can take the formation and reverse the patterns. We can make the tight-end side the weak side of your formation and have them run the same routes as the other side did. They reverse patterns. The tight end would run the crossing route. The split end runs the six route. The pro back runs the hitch, and the wideout on the split-end side runs the post route. The quarterback reads the set. If the hitch is available, we take it. If the defense is up tight, we run the 60-shallow combinations.

This has been a good route for us, particularly on third down. It was good on 3rd and 5 or 3rd and 6. You need to work on those situations in practice. As I was saying earlier, you know what won for you, and you know what lost for you. We do a lot of team passing drills because we are going against good people every week. We go one against one every day except Thursday. Now, they can't tackle the quarterback. It makes the line work hard on protection, and it give your defensive front work against good people. Another thing, it

 





Page 54

makes your secondary go against your best players in stressful situations. When we go scout team, the defense is on top of the quarterback before he can throw the ball.

We run another route very similar to this. We like to get into the trips look because we like to run the speed option, strong or weak. We like to look at soft run support. You cannot throw the ball if you cannot make the defense worry about stopping the run. You must make the defense support the area on the outside. We like to run the speed option inside the 20 because we do not have to block as many people

We run a wide- drag combination that is very similar to the shallow route. Now we have both ends running across the field. We do not teach them to pick. If the defense runs into us, that is part of the game. We do not teach the pick. If the defense is in man, we have our best receiver running a full-speed crossing route. We can run this play from a lot of formations. The idea is that one of the two ends will be open.

We have an 80 route for the outside receivers. We have the outside man coming over the top on the post route. If the defense is in man and the safety gets hung up, we will try to get the ball deep. If the defense is in a zone, we usually hit the other wideout on a curl route.

One of the best plays in the game today is the stretch or zone play. Now teams are running the naked boot off the stretch play. The question for us on that play is what kind of route the inside man will run. We do not want the quarterback to rush the play. If the defense is not fooled and comes for the quarterback, he must be ready to throw the ball to the tight end coming across. If the defense is fooled, he can look to the flat area.

After the quarterback comes out of the fake, he always looks deep. We call it the Ray Charles play. Very seldom is he going to throw the deep ball, but as he comes out of the fake, we want him to look for the deep man. If the deep man is not open, the quarterback looks for the 30 route on the outside or the tight end coming across. The man on the boundary needs to know where he is on the field. If he is on the hash mark, he can come across quickly. If he is in the middle of the field, he will have to settle down. He does not want to get over too far.

We like to put the backs in motion inside the 20-yard line. We like to run the stretch play where we can secure the edge. We are not talking about the running game, but we want to secure the edge so we can get the ball to the next level.

Another thing we may do is to call toss or quick screen. The only difference between the stretch and toss is this: We are going to use zone blocking with our line, but our quarterback is going to turn and toss the ball to our tailback and let him run with it a little more quickly.

What happens when you call the quick screen? Half of the time, you end up checking out of the thing. We always package the screen with a running play. If the defense plays us two on two, we will throw the screen. If they play us in base coverage, we run it up and down the field.

One more point before I quit. As we get closer to the goal line, one of our favorite plays is the flood route. Again, we like to package it with a sprint-out pass action. Even if our quarterback is not really agile, we will run that action. We make it look just like the flood route, but we end up blocking people. Now, we run the play, and they are playing pass. We come out making the play look like the pass, and the quarterback runs the ball. You would be surprised, even if you have a limited athlete as quarterback, how well that play works. He can walk into the end zone with the ball. Now, the better the quarterback, the better the play will work. If we send a man in motion and the defensive man runs with him, they are playing man. If he does not go with motion, we have to make an adjustment and hit another receiver. Men, it was great being here.

A Simple Approach to the Passing Game

Skyline High School, Utah

It is a real privilege for me to speak to you. I have been to Denver several times. I enjoy coming to this clinic.

I will start off with a video of a game with Plano High School, Texas, when they needed four onside kicks at the end of the game to win. They were successful on all four onside kicks. They were down 41-17 in the last minutes of the game, made a great comeback, but lost the game at the end after they went ahead. They made a regular kick on the kickoff, and the other team returned it for a touchdown. [Video]

I could do a lecture just about the things that happened in that film. We show this tape to our kids to convince them to never give up. You always have a chance. I recall going to a clinic at the University of Colorado when Bill Mallory was the head coach. He brought in a high school coach from Cincinnati by the name of Bron Bacevich. Bron was a legend in Ohio. Bron talked about the fact that when you are down by only two touchdowns, you always have a chance to get back in the game. We try to emphasize this with our kids each week. It does not matter; as long as we are only down by two touchdowns, we have a chance to win the game. I really believe in this. It has happened to us several times. Our kids have been prepared and programmed to believe that they can come back and win.

We have some great coaches in the state of Utah. One is LaVell Edwards of BYU. Some of the best coaches in America are right here in Colorado. The Air Force Academy is on the cutting edge of what they do. The University of Colorado and Colorado State do a great job. The new staff at Wyoming will do a great job. You have a national champion in Northern Colorado. You can go to them and get information to help your program. You can attend clinics such as this. You are lucky to be here. I think I am lucky to be a head football coach. I hope you feel the same. A football coach has a big influence in the lives of young men. I have enjoyed this clinic and have gotten some good ideas that I think will help our program. I hope the material that I share with you today will help you in your program. I will tell you what we do at Skyline High School in Salt Lake City. Drop me a note if you are interested in additional materials.

You cannot have a good program without a great coaching staff. It does not matter whether your coaching staff is big or small or whether your school is big or small. I have found that most coaches are good teachers. I found that out at this clinic. You can tell if a coach is a good teacher because you just learn from him. You can pick up good things from good coaches.

People who have influenced me in my career include Coach LaVell Edwards. When I was a senior playing at BYU, it was his first year as an assistant coach at BYU. I did not get to know him that well. He was coaching a position different from what I was playing. I remember after we played at Arizona and got our butts kicked, he came up to me and said, "Roger, you did a good job." I felt bad that we had lost the game, but just that one comment from him stayed with me. I will remember that the rest of my life. I am sure you have remembered the good and the bad that your coaches told you when you were playing. If we can be positive with our players, it will pay off in the end. We are the dream makers for our players. Twenty years after they are away from football, they are not going to look back and say, "Boy, we had a great English teacher." They are going to say, "Do you remember what that dumb coach did that one day?'' They will talk about the coaches and remember the good and the bad things.

When Bill Walsh was speaking, I would try to go to listen to him. I first heard him speak in Reno when he spoke at a clinic just after he took the Stanford job.

Another name that I will mention is Tony Mason. He has passed away, but he was great. He was an

 





Page 56

assistant at Michigan before he went to Arizona as head coach. If you can get any of his motivational tapes, you would get a lot out of them. He was a real coach. In Ohio he won something like 55 straight games.

Fisher DeBerry is another great name. We run an offense similar to the Air Force in some aspects. He has been so helpful to me in everything that I know about the option offense. I was an assistant coach for seven years and then the head coach at Highlands before going to Skyline High School.

The year 1982 was the turning point in my career, when I saw Air Force come in to play BYU. They beat BYU. Ken Hatfield was the head coach at Air Force at the time. Coach DeBerry was an assistant. They got me to start thinking about the problems with our passing game. Our quarterback had messed up throwing the ball, and we had some real problems. Our players did not seem to be as big as the other team. I decided to study the Air Force offense. That winter, I took an assistant coach with me, and we went to visit the Air Force Academy. Coach DeBerry was very nice to me, helping me with the offense. We came back and put it in our offense, and I have loved it ever since. It is a perfect offense for high school. You can always find someone that can run the ball. It is so team oriented. We still go back to the Air Force Academy and visit. They have some of the best teachers in the county.

At Skyline High we have mottoes. In 1993 our motto was "one heartbeat." Our captain would get in the huddle and yell "one." The entire team would respond "heartbeat." This was a great motivational tool.

The next year I wanted to keep the same motto. In 1993 we went 13-0 and won the state championship. Why change? The captains wanted to change it. We got to the semifinals but did not win the state.

In 19951 decided that we did need a new motto. I saw Coach Lombardi when he was coaching in northern California. He talked about his motto. He would yell out, "You gotta." The team would respond with "believe." I really liked that. We used that motto and felt we would keep it forever. We won the state championship again.

In 1996 I decided we would get a new team motto, but we would also keep the other one. We did the double logo that Texas Tech has. Our motto was "Teamtogether." When they were in the huddle, the captain would say, "Team." The team would say, "Together." As the season went on and we approached the playoff, another motto developed. We had a couple of team members who just could not focus. We adopted the motto ''Focus and finish." Marty Schottenheimer uses this in some of his talks, so we stressed to the team that they had to "focus and finish.''

We elect two new captains in December. I like doing this because that helps share the responsibility of getting the team ready to go next year.

In one of the 
Coach of the Year Clinic Manuals 
I read that a team selected team leaders, so we have done that recently. We just elected seven team leaders. We have two captains and seven team leaders. We are going to have an NFL draft-type program.

We are going to have those nine players select the rest of the squad and put them on their squad. Now if we need to contact the team or give something to the kids, we can go to the captains and leaders, and it goes right down the line to the rest of the squad. Now we have nine players that can monitor the program to see how everyone is doing. In the summer we will select one of the seven leaders as a third captain. We will have three captains and six leaders during the season. During the season we have one honorary captain, so for each game we really end up with four captains. That captain can be anyone on the team. It has been really helpful for us.

When we first came to Skyline, we had to put together a staff. We have been together for 11 years now. We have outstanding coaches. They set a good example, and they are leaders. They are good teachers and good coaches.

I studied the teams that we have had a hard time beating over the years. I found that the teams that give us the most trouble are the teams that play a tough, hard-nosed defense. They are playing man to man in the secondary. They blitz about half the time against you. They do enough to really confuse the offense. As a result of this, I encouraged our coaches at Skyline High to develop this type of defense. We are an attack man-to-man defense. We try to cause confusion for the offense by running a lot of stunts. We want to put pressure on the offense to keep it from getting momentum. It took a couple of years to sell this defense. Since we have been running the pressure defense, we have won three state championships in four years. Actually, we have won four championships in seven years. We have been in the state finals six of the last ten years.

I am not going to talk about our defense, but I think the reason we have had so much success is because we play an aggressive defense that keeps the offense off balance. If the offense can deal with the pressure, you may be in trouble, but most offenses do not deal with pressure very well.

We line up and stem our line and linebackers. We do not stem them together. The tackle or noseguard can do his own stemming. We have the line moving individually. Our linebackers do not stem a lot, but they are getting better at it. That has really helped us on defense.

One of the things that we stress to our kids is to try to determine whether the offense is going to run the ball or whether they are going to pass the ball from the stances of the offense. We spend a lot of time looking at film. We want to see if they give away the play when they are running a pass play, running play, trap play, or any special play. Sometimes you can tell when those big tackles rock back on their heels to pass block. You can tell when the weight is on his hand and his butt is up in the air and he is ready to go. We spend time with our kids trying to show them what to look for on this. We do not guarantee this, but we are about 90 percent accurate. When we think we have the play figured out, we make a call that alerts our linebackers and secondary and out line. If we think it is a run, we call our tank. If they are in a pass stance, we call out an airline, such as Delta, American, or whatever. If they are in a Delta stance, we let our secondary know. If one man is in a Delta stance and everyone else is in a tank stance, we look for the counter tray or trap play. This does not help you with every team. Some teams do a good job of disguising their offense. However, some teams tip their plays a great deal of the time.

We have evolved into a two-platoon system. We have only been doing this the last two years. You may give up some players on one side of the ball, but in the long run it will make you stronger. We get twice as much time to work with each group by running the twoplatoon system.

We do use a lot of different formations. We used to line people up exactly the same all of the time. Then we started moving them around within the formations and got some great results. We used to run the ace formation just as the Air Force Academy ran it. Now we have what we call a new ace formation that allows the two wide receivers to move to adjust their splits.

ACE FORMATION

After we ran the new ace formation, we decided to adjust some of the other formations. We started splitting people out and putting the backs on the hash marks. This changed things a lot.

NEW SPLIT FORMATION

Then we went to our trips set. We could run it to either side.

 





Page 58

TRIPS

We run the rip-twins look with the inside man on the hash mark.

RIP TWINS

Now, there are so many things you can do. You do not want to confuse your kids. You do not want to do all of this on offense and beat yourself. You still need to keep it simple, but you can keep the offense so that you do not get confused and the kids do not get confused. I think that is the trend today. Also, a lot of coaches are using motion with the different sets. Some coaches go to it too much at the high school level, and the kids get confused. When that happens, they do not execute well. If our kids do not execute the new plays that we put in very well, then I put them in the recycle bin. If a play is in there, I will not use it for the game. If it will confuse anyone on the team, we are not going to use the play. That is my rule. I do not want to beat myself. Most teams beat themselves. We won a lot of games because the other team beat themselves and not because we were a better football team. If you can cut down on your mistakes, then you have a chance of winning the game. What I am saying is this: On motion, formations, and new plays, you need to be careful to make sure you know what you are doing.

I would like a balance between the run and pass at 50-50. That is never going to happen. It would be nice if it were at 60-40. It would be good if it were 70-30. We are about 80-20. The parents of our wide receivers think we run 95 percent of the time and pass 5 percent of the time. But look, if we run the option and the defense can't stop us, what do you do? Do you stop running the option and throw the ball? No! I feel that if you work on the pass, you will be able to throw the ball. If you are behind in a game, you have the chance to come back and win that game if you have a decent passing attack.

I get tired of hearing TV commentators say that teams that run the wishbone cannot come back. They get in the fourth quarter, and that is when they start telling everyone that the team is in trouble if they are behind. Sometimes they are right. Those wishbone teams just have to grind out the yardage. I keep asking this question when I see teams that have trouble coming from behind: Why can't they put in some simple pass plays with a really strong running attack, so if you do get behind, you have a chance to come back?

To me there is nothing better than the play-action pass. We all score from those plays. I think you need some type of bootleg action; you may have a run-out action. We do not sprint out, but we have a semi-sprint. Where we may be different from other people is this. We put in a three-step, five-step, and seven-step package. This is so that if we do need a certain type of pass in a given situation, we can do that play.

From the three-step drop we have our quick-out, slant, and fade routes. From the five-step drop we throw the square-in route and a streak route. Bill Walsh said that if you can complete two or three streak routes per season, that it is a successful play for you. That is about what we do for the season. On the seven-step drop we run the deep out, curl route, and a play that we call scissors. It has been a good play for us. When we are behind, we run this play. It is my favorite play. It is good against the zone or man. BYU was using this play in the 1980s. They do not do this much anymore, but they have variations of the play.

This play is out of our ace formation. The way we teach the seven-step drop is three big steps and four quick steps. It is really good against man coverage.

 





Page 59

SCISSORS

This is when crossing patterns work best. We do not run the pick with two ends. Once the end gets past the linebacker, he should be able to outrun him. Get him the ball when he clears. Against the zone, the split end underneath is open, unless the free safety comes up, and he never comes up. When we get in trouble, we run this play.

What should we put in our passing attack? What type of option should we run? In the spring we start working with our quarterbacks. We do not interfere with the other sports. We want other sports to be successful at Skyline. We want all sports to be successful at Skyline. If the quarterback is involved in one of the other sports, it is hard to work with him. We have most of our football team in our weight-training class. We have them most of the year. We do start working with the quarterback in the summer. We start working seven-on-seven drills. Some schools go out of state to do the seven-on-seven camps. We will go to one or two tournaments in Utah. By the end of the summer, I usually know how much passing we can do and how much we can't pass. I have an idea who can throw the ball and who can't throw the ball. I know who the good receivers are.

We do not start working on the option until our conditioning drills and our two-a-day practices. We spend most of our time trying to see whether we can do something passing the football. We need to be able to execute and look good on the play. If you win a state championship in Utah, then you get the privilege of coaching the All-Star Game. What a headache that can be. The All-Star Game is just before two-a-days. You do not get a lot of time before you get to the two-a-days, and you do not go in fresh, but the All-Star Game is a lot of fun. You get good players to coach. Energy-wise and time-wise, it kind of puts you behind. We got the all-stars for one week, and we were able to put in all of our offense. We had a simple option attack and a simple passing attack. We have coached three All-Star Games, and we are averaging 40 points for the three games. If you keep it simple and do not confuse the players, it will help. If I can understand it, they can understand it. How much coaching do you have to do with an all-star to run a streak?

The other part of our passing game involves the screen passes. I heard Coach Don Read of the University of Montana talk at a lecture. They were national champs in 1995 and runners-up in 1996 in Division II. He retired after winning the championship. He was a smart coach. Quit while you are on top. He said they worked 20 minutes a day on screen passes. I have never worked that much on screen passes. This past year we worked on it twice a week for 20 minutes each of the two days. It really helped us. The screen can be one heck of a play. Montana throws 11 or 12 screens per game. If you break that down, it comes out to two or three per quarter. They run a lot of different screens.

We threw two or three screens per game. It was a lot of fun, and they really worked. I will cover our wide receiver middle screen that we call "Millie." I like to give names to our pass plays. I give names to a lot of them. Our screen left is called "Sally." Our screen right is "Sara." Our middle screen is ''Millie." If it is coming from the opposite direction, we just call it "Millie Left.'' We do have a fullback screen, but we never used it in a game. It was fun to practice. The fullback had trouble catching the ball. We ran it in practice, but we did not use it in a game.

"MILLIE"

It really helped our attack this year to spend some extra time on this play. Let me show you the play, and then I will show you the play on video.

We bring the slot man outside to block the corner. The inside linemen release on the inside linebackers to the safety. Our rule on the option is this: We go block the linebacker or safety. If the linebacker is knocked down, go knock the safety down. If the safety is not there, escort the runner for a touchdown. It is simple for our linemen, and they do a really good job on it.

We have the line block for one half of a second. That is not long. They show pass, and then they go. The quarterback is on his own. He is an athlete. When the defense is coming in, the quarterback must find a way to get the ball to the wide receiver. We want the wide receiver to run straight at the quarterback. We find that we get a better angle that way. He takes one step up and turns and comes back toward the quarterback who is dropping back.

We have run this play out of a three-step drop and the five-step drop. The right tackle must release faster than the other linemen. He only sets for about one fourth of a second. He releases more quickly.

This play is a good way to get the ball to a shifty back and let him do his thing. You can put a real good running back out there and throw him the ball. Let me show the video.

Basic Defensive Alignment and Adjustments

Texas Tech University

I am proud to be here. Defense is sort of fun to talk about. Offense is not fun to talk about. If you coach offensive football, you have to be a genius. You have to remember all those rules. You have to learn what to do in every situation. That is assignment football. Assignment football is fine. You have to have it. But I'm glad we have someone else to coach it. Defense is reaction. You react to the ball and situation, and that is a whole lot more fun to coach.

I coached at a little school in Texas called Midland Lee High School. At Midland we had a good little old team. I had coached in a lot of high schools, and I got fired at a bunch of them. I was coaching at Midland and then had a chance to go to Texas Tech. I got a chance to be the defensive coordinator. I don't know why I did it. We had just lost in the state championships. After you lose a game, you are sort of crazy anyway. The dog doesn't like you. Your wife doesn't like you. Nobody likes you.

The guy from Texas Tech called me and asked me to take the job. I told him I would. I told him, "A lot has happened since last week when I turned down the job." I took the job and went up there. I was the defensive coordinator. I could bring any of my coaches with me that I wanted. "It's your defensedo anything you want to." I told him it was going to be a high school defense. He said he didn't care, just come.

I went up there, and we did pretty good. We had some pretty good defensive players. We did good enough that the head coach got fired. I was getting ready to go to the next school when they hired David McWilliams. He and I had coached together for five years at the University of Texas. I stayed on and later became the head coach after David left. He went to the University of Texas, and they hired me.

The moral of the story was that I really liked what we were doing on defense. We ran a 4-3 defense. It was the old Bum Phillips defense that we had run before. It was amusing; we ran a high school defense the first year I was the defensive coordinator at Tech, and we led the nation in pass defense. That just proves statistics don't mean much. Nobody had to pass. They just ran the football up and down the field on us.

I became the head coach at Texas Tech and my secondary coach, Coach Carlos Slaytor, became my defensive coordinator. We hired a couple of pro guys who were out of a job, and, boy, were they smart. They had all the answers. They started talking to old Carlos, and the next thing I know, we are running a 3-4 defense. We started doing things I had never heard of. We had guys in the press box watching everything. The defense was so complicated, it was a mystery. People roared up and down the field on us. The players weren't any good either. That had a lot to do with it. They were terrible.

The Chicago Bears called and wanted old Carlos to come up there and coach. He went. I started looking around for a defensive coordinator. I came to the conclusion that I would be the defensive coordinator. I used to have more fun doing that than anything else. I hadn't been having any fun being the head coach. As the head coach, all I did was walk around with a clip board. Being a head coach is overrated. There ain't much to do. All they want you to do is get out of the way. I tried to look like I knew what I was doing.

Well, I took the defense, and we put in a new scheme in the spring. We had more fun that spring than we had in years.

The second year that I coached, I coached at Ballinger High School. That is my hometown. There were 3112 people who lived there. There's not that many there anymore. We were a AA school with two coaches. Bob Wright and I were the only coaches. Bob loved offense. He coached the offense, and I was the line coach. When we went to defense, he told me that he was

 





Page 62

going to the coffee shop to get a cup of coffee. We worked on defense until he came back. Sometimes we worked on defense for two hours. He didn't know who our defensive players were or what we were running. That was great. When you get rid of the head coach, you do all the things you would do if you were the head coach.

The last year that I was in college, Bum Phillips came up with his numbers defense. He was coaching for Bear Bryant at Texas A&M. We ran the numbers defense at Ballinger. The even techniques are head-up positions. The odd techniques are shoulder techniques. From the center out both ways are the numbers. Head up the center was a 0 technique. Head up the guard was 2, the tackle 4, and the tight end 6. The inside shoulder of the guard was 1, and the outside shoulder was 3 technique. The outside shoulder of the tackle was 5. The inside shoulder of the tight end was a 9 technique. The inside shoulder of the tight end was a 7 technique.

The first thing we did was to know how to line up. We could change those defenses as quick as you could shake a stick. We could call 37 on one side and a 59 on the other. That was a good defense. We had an eagle on one side and a 50 defense on the other. We were good and had one heck of a football team. When Carlos left, I thought I would go back and run that Ballinger defense. I had three assistant coaches tell me I couldn't do that. This was in the 1990s, and I was talking about running a defense we had run in the 60s. We did that. I think it is still pretty good.

At our level you have to stop the run. You can do that with an eight-man front defense. If you can't stop the run, just tell old Grandma you're going to be there for Christmas. You are not going to any bowl games if you can't stop the run. I'm not very smart, but through arithmetic I know that if you've got seven guys up there, they can't do as well as eight. We are going to have eight guys up toward the line, and sometimes we are going to cheat and have nine. We are going to play the safety as the middle linebacker. That was part of what we set out to do. Also, we said we were going to keep it simple.

I learned a great lesson four or five years ago. Bobby Ross went to San Diego as head coach. He hired Bill Arnsparger as his defensive coordinator. Well, Bill is 150 years old. He hadn't coached football in 25 years. He went in there and told them they were going to line up correctly. The year before, the San Diego Chargers lined up by alignment wrong over 50 percent of the time before the ball was snapped. Their defense was the worst in the NFL. When they went to camp, they didn't work on technique. They worked on getting lined up correctly. I believe that the next year they ended up number 4 in the NFL, and the following year they were number 1 on defense. That was all due to lining up correctly.

I didn't think lining up was so hard. It is hard if you are not careful. We said that we were going to start over. We had a notebook burning. We had a notebook that weighed 80 pounds. We had a couple guys on our staff who were "notebook nuts." I said, "Get rid of the notebook." I told them, if they wanted to change jobs, to do it. We are going to change this defense. If you want to be part of it, that was fine. If you don't, then leave. We are going to be simple. We told our players if you don't like it, don't bitch. Just take off. We were going to find somebody who does want to play. Just leave, and good luck to you.

We started off with four simple objectives. They were simple. (1) Stop the run. (2) Be simple. (3) Create some turnovers. This next one I really think is important in football. I think the difference between winning and losing is momentum. (4) Have the ability to change the momentum of a game. If you are not careful and do not have a way to change the momentum of a game, you are in trouble. Sometimes you don't have any control over that. We are willing to roll the dice and change the momentum of the game.

We stress turnovers. We have a drill which takes us nine minutes to run. It has five stations in it, and we

 





Page 63

practice causing turnovers every single, solitary day. For the last three years we have been fourth, seventh, and third in turnover ratio in the nation. That gives you a chance to play football and be successful. The number one objective of the offensive team is, "Do not turn the ball over." If that is the number one objective on offense, then the number one objective on defense should be, "Make them turn the ball over." That is what we are going to try to do. We had a board with 31 defensive objectives on it. We had things like "Stop teams 20 percent of the time inside the 20-yard line." You had to figure what yard line it was and use a calculator, and by that time they were snapping the ball. We couldn't keep up with all our objectives.

I told the coaches, "No more objectives." My assistants said, "We have to have defensive objectives." I said, "Okay, we're going to have five." Here they are. (1) Execute the defense called in the huddle. That took the place of four of the previous objectives on that board. (2) Be physical. The defense doesn't have to worry about assignments, so be physical. (3) Sell out every play. That means give 110 percent on every play. I shouldn't say this and don't take this wrong. We've got players, and then we've got eaters and crappers. We put 60 guys on an airplane to go play. You have about 40 that play their butts off. You have 20 guys standing around giggling and farting. They eat like hell; they eat everything. You just have a lot of eaters and crappers around. You need to get rid of them and get some players. We are going to have a bunch of guys play for us. But you can bet that if they don't bust their butts when the ball is snapped, they're not going to play for us. (4) No gifts. Make the offense earn everything they get. It is hard to take the ball and move it for a long period of time. (5) Tackle. That is what defense is all about.

We have some guys who are not very smart around our place. It starts with me. I'm probably the dumbest guy, but I can remember those five objectives. We quiz our players on these all the time. They better know them.

The thing we want to do is match up well. If you have a great back, we are going to make you throw the football. If we play a team that has a great receiver, we will do everything in our power to take him out of the game. We want to make the offense do something out of the ordinary to beat us. We don't let you do what you have always done. This is how we set up our defense. I hope this is not boring you to tears; at the same time, I hope it is not too elementary. This is the best I have ever seen.

We are going to base our defense off the numbers defense. There are eight gaps, and we have gap responsibility. We have gap control and will have a guy in each one of those gaps. We tell our tackles that we are going to call 1, 2, or 3. That tells them where to line up. We have a strong and weak side to the defense. The first number is the strong-side tackle or tight-end side, and the second number is the weak-side tackle or split-end side. A 31 defensive alignment puts the strong-side tackle in a 3 technique, and he has B gap responsibility. The backside tackle, in a 1 technique, has A gap responsibility. The Mike linebacker plays to the strong side and has the strong-side A or B gap. The Will linebacker plays to the weak side and has A or B gap. In the 31 defense, since the strong tackle has the B gap, the Mike linebacker has A gap. On the weak side the weak tackle has A gap, so the Will linebacker has the B gap. That is how we start the defense and where the tackles and inside linebackers line up.

On the outside we do four things. We play regular, solid, hammer, and wide. If we play a regular alignment, the defensive end lines up in a 7 technique. If we call a "33," that is a regular defense for us.

 





Page 64

If we call a "31 solid," the defensive end would be in a 6 technique, and the Sam linebacker is in a 9 technique. If we called an "11 hammer," the defensive end is in a 9 technique, and the Sam linebacker is in a 6 technique off the ball. If we called a "22 wide," the Sam linebacker lines up in a 7 technique off the ball, and the defensive end lines up in a true 8 position.

On the split-end side we are playing an outside linebacker 3 yards outside and 3 yards deep. The weakside defensive end is playing a loose 5 technique on the offensive tackle.

Our Mike linebacker is the A or B gap player. He is the toughest linebacker we have. He has common sense. He has to cover the fullback and tight end sometimes. You can get by with an average guy with good intelligence who understands the game. He is an old-fashioned inside linebacker.

Last year, the leading tackler on our team was the left end. He only weighed 212 pounds. The reason he was playing there was that we didn't have anyone who weighed any more who was any better. He ran a 4.5 forty, which helped him. You can play a guy here who is small but can run. This next year we can move him to linebacker because we have two bigger ends that can run.

Our Sam linebacker was a 193-pound high school tailback. He started 43 football games at Texas Tech playing in front of tight ends. He is one heck of a football player. He has to play pass defense and rush the passer. But the big thing is that he has to play against the run.

The Will linebacker has to be a pretty good football player. He has to run pretty well also. He has to cover the tailback on passes and a fourth receiver vertical in some cases. He has to play the run some. He fills the lanes on the cutbacks. Ours is about 210 pounds.

The outside linebacker is called the "Raider linebacker." Since we are the Red Raiders, our rover is called a Raider. This guy here is a good football player. He is a secondary player who is tough enough to play against the run. We can get guys for these positions. If they are big enough but don't have enough speed to play the corner, they can play here. We can get personnel to fill these positions. That is how we pick the front eight people in our defense. Our tackles are just leftovers. That's where we play the principal's son. If nothing else, just put them in a gap, and tell them to submarine and tie up two players.

Everything we do on defense is based on two or three things. We are a gap-control defense, so let's start out in a regular "22." We want all 11 guys to key the football. That is the first key. The next key is whether the ball is on or off the line of scrimmage. The third thing is whether the ball is toward or away from our position. The fourth thing is the speed the ball is moving. That is called the tempo of the ball. Everything we do on defense is based on those things.

One hundred years ago when I played football, the middle linebacker had the first threat coming into the line of scrimmage. Our Mike linebacker has A gap on flow to him. If the ball goes away from him, he pursues and takes the first threat off the line of scrimmage. On flow away from the Will linebacker, he has the first cutback threat. If the ball is tossed to the tailback on a sweep, the tempo of the play is fast. If the ball is handed off, the tempo is a little slower. That is how we decide on what speed to pursue the ball. If the ball is away from me on the line, I chase it down the line. If the ball is away from me off the line, I chase it off the line. If it is fast, I go fast. If it is slow, I slow down. That is what tempo is all about. You can't coach defensive football if your team doesn't understand tempo. We work on this all the time. That is the reason we run to the ball so well.

If you knew whether they were going to run or pass, it would make your job easier. Somebody on the offensive line is going to tell you. We think we know

 





Page 65

whether it is pass or run every time before the ball is snapped. The quarterback may lick his fingers when he is going to throw. The left guard may tip when he is going to pull, pass block, or run block. Somebody on that line will tell us, and we communicate it to the others.

This is really a big word in our scheme, but it is important. If the offense runs a sweep to the outside, we tell the safety, who is lined up in the middle of the formation, to attack the line of scrimmage where he fits. That means don't run into some responsibility blind. If the contain gets knocked down and the ball is not being turned inside, don't fill inside. Go to where you fit. Have enough sense to know what the defense is all about. Make your pursuit fit the play.

Our cover one is our man free coverage. If you want to cut your teaching down, go to this numbering system. I heard Wade Phillips talk about this about 10 years ago. We number the receiver from the strong side to the weak side. The wide receiver to the strong side is 1, the tight end is 2, the fullback is 3, the tailback is 4, and the wide receiver to the weak side is 5. If 3 and 4 are in the I formation, whichever receiver comes weak is 4 and the one that goes strong is 3. In our man free coverage, the strong corner has 1, the Sam linebacker has 2, the Mike linebacker has 3, the Raider has 4, and the weak corner has 5. The Will linebacker and safety are free. We can blitz him or leave him as a hole player. He could take the coverage on 3 and let the Mike linebacker blitz.

We can call "1-key weak bracket." That means we double both wide receivers. The weak corner and Raider take 5 in some kind of combination man. They play him in and out or short and deep. The strong corner and safety take 1 in the same scheme. The Sam linebacker takes 2, and the Mike and Will linebacker take 3 and 4.

We can call "1 cloud." The corners roll up and beat the hell out of the wide receivers. The Raider and safety play behind the corners and protect deep. The linebackers pick up their people as they did in the double. If the receiver tries to come out and cross, the linebackers wall them off and combo them in and out. The Will linebacker takes the back who runs outside, and the Mike linebacker takes the back who comes inside.

We also play cover three. Cover three is our three-deep zone. The Sam linebacker and Raider are the curl to flat players. The Mike and Will linebackers are hook to curl players.

The corners and safety play thirds. The funny thing about this is we play cover three about 15 percent of

 





Page 66

the time, but we made 50 percent of our interceptions while we were in this coverage. We don't like to play this coverage because it doesn't fit the style of defense we run.

We line up the same way every time in the secondary. That is the way we disguise our coverage. Our tempo changer is the blitz. We blitz the hell out of people. The best blitz we have is when we bring these guys. We also run a "double dog." That has been good to us. We also like to bring the Raider and Will linebacker off the weak side. When you bring four rushers weak, it presents a problem for the offense. When we bring both of these guys, the Mike linebacker picks up 4, the Sam linebacker takes 3, the safety takes 2, and the corners have 1 and 5.

I've covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, but I believe that is a pretty simple method. That is not what wins for you. I understand that. You have to be able to block and tackle. I don't think we have any problem lining up correctly. We are never outflanked.

We don't have any problems with motion or flipflopping or any gimmick. When we play a twins team, we put both our corners to the same side. We match up wide receivers on corners. We can still play hard corners and have the Raider backing them up.

We have a circuit we do in practice. We have five stations with 10 guys at each station. The first station works on recovering fumbles. It is not a picking-themup drill, it is recovering them. We do all kinds of fumble drills. We do that for a minute and 30 seconds.

The second station is a one-man strip drill: one ball carrier and one tackler. The tackler is working on stripping the arms away from the ball.

The third station is working on catching the football. They are running tip drills and every ball-handling drill you can think of. We work on intercepting the ball. Everyone does it, from the tackles up.

The fourth station is a two-man strip drill. The first man tackles and strips. The second man comes in and clubs the crap out of the ball. If the ball comes loose, the first guy who made the tackle picks it up and scores. These types of things happen every Saturday.

The last station is helmet on the ball. We stick the ball with our helmet. If the ball comes out, we pick it up and run with it.

Coaches are the luckiest guys in the world. We are the last frontier. If you don't enjoy and love kids and really love coaching, you need to quit. You can make more money driving a Greyhound bus. We have the greatest profession in the world. I coached a long time, and the greatest thrill I have is to see the guys I've coached go into the coaching profession. That makes you feel good. Today in the United States of America people won't try to be a doctor because they are afraid they will fail. They are scared to become a coach because they don't think they can do it.

I learned this years ago. I went to Alabama to watch spring practice. Bear Bryant was the coach. I stayed there three days. It didn't take long to figure out why they were national champions. We got ready to leave and went out on the field to tell Coach Bryant thanks for the hospitality. He told us before we left to go to his office and read "that deal on the wall." He said, "That is what it is all about." I did not know what he was talking about. "Yes, sir." I thought that was what you were supposed to say. We went to his office and waited for him. When he came in he showed us up on the wall a framed poem. He said, ''Read that, boy, that's the real deal. That is what it is all about." The poem was "The Man in the Arena.''

THE MAN IN THE ARENA 
It is not the critic who counts, 

Nor the man who points out 

How the strong man stumbled, 

Or where the doer of deeds 

Could have done them better. 

The credit belongs to the man 

Who is actually in the arena; 

Whose fate is marred 

By dust and sweat and blood; 

Who errs and comes short again; 

Who knows the great enthusiasms, the great 

devotions; and spends himself in a worthy cause; 

Who at best knows in the end 

The triumph of high achievement; 

And who at the worst, 

If he fails, at least fails 

While daring greatly; 

So that his place shall never be with those cold and 

timid souls 

Who know neither 

Victory nor defeat.

Thank you, men; I have enjoyed this opportunity to be here.

LaVell Edwards

The BYU Passing Game

Brigham Young University

Thank you. It is good to be here in Hawaii with you guys. I was a high school coach for eight years. They buried my record so deep that nobody has ever found it. I never had any winning seasons. The only reason I got into college coaching is because I was the only Mormon in the world running the single-wing offense. Hal Mitchell took the job at BYU and wanted to bring back the single-wing to college. He hired me. It obviously didn't work. A year or so later Hal was relieved.

I became the head coach there in 1972. The only reason I mention this is because a lot of you coaches are faced with the problems I had. When I was coaching high school football, for the first five years I didn't have an assistant who had played football, let alone played in college or had any experience. I finally got one who had some experience, and that helped considerably.

When I went to BYU as an assistant, they had averaged about three victories a year for the first 47 years they had played major college football. They never had a winning season or won any type of championship. They were thinking about giving up football. After we got things turned, it has gone on from that to be a very successful program. We have had a great deal of success over the past 20 years.

In this business there are the "haves" and the "have nots." If you are a ''have," no matter what you do, you will be successful. If you are a "have not" at a place like ours, you have to be creative. You have to do some things a little differently. You really have to work at it. BYU is definitely a "have not." We try to create a different approach.

I had never thrown the football. For the 10 years that I was an assistant at BYU, I was a defensive coach. I worked for two coaches over that 10-year period. When I was appointed head coach, it was not a matter of 
if 
was going to get fired, it was 
when. 
That was the history of the way things had been going at BYU. There are about four or five key words that I stress a lot with our team and staff. Particularly with my staff, since I don't do a lot of coaching myself anymore. We have a veteran staff. I try to set the tone for what we want to accomplish.

Attitude is everything. It is an elusive thing, but to create an attitude is so important. One of the greatest stories I've every heard comes from a guy named Bob Blackman. He coached at Dartmouth and Illinois. I heard him speak one time at a clinic. He told this story. This great big tackle got married to this tiny girl. On their wedding night after all the activities were over, they were in the room together alone. He took off his pants, handed them to her, and told her to put them on. She told him that was crazy; they were too big. She said, "I can't wear these pants." He said, "That's right. Let's establish that fact right now; I'm going to wear the pants in this family." She said, "Fine." A little while later in the evening, she took her panties off. She tossed them to him and told him to put them on. He said, "Are you crazy? I can't get in those panties." She said, "That's right. And there is no way you're going to unless you change your attitude.'' She got to the heart of what attitude is all about.

I am not here to convert anyone to do what we do. Hopefully, you can gain an idea that will fit into what you are doing. That is my sole purpose for being here. That is the way it is with motivation. That motivation has to come from within. I don't believe in fear motivation. I don't coach that way. I work our guys hard, but I'm always talking to them about creating that attitude, that intensive desire to be successful.

Our guys believe that when we go into a game, we are going to win. No matter how bad or ugly things are, they believe we can pull out the win. It hasn't always been that way. I don't know all the keys to motivation. All I know is you have to have that attitude.

 





Page 69

There are two things that I absolutely insist on in practice. One is concentration, and the other is intensity. Your players cannot improve or get better unless they concentrate. The thing that gets to me quicker than anything is a guy going through the motions and not paying attention. We are not on a clock in our practice, but we demand concentration. We have coaches who will not let anything go by.

We want our players to be intense and play hard every play. There is nothing new about that. But you are not going to get it done without it. We play one down at a time and play it hard.

Our whole approach has been one of consistency and execution. It doesn't matter whether we look great or terrible on Saturday. I do the same thing on Monday. We have done it that way for years. I will be a little more upset if we have lost. But I don't bring guys back and scrimmage them or bench them. I try not to do anything differently. I don't know if that is all that important, but that is the way I do it.

What is important is execution. We don't do a whole lot of things differently today than we have been doing for the last 15 or 20 years. I'm going to take a couple of plays and show you what we have done with them. One of our lead plays is the same pass route we have been running for the last 20 years. The very first day we go out for spring practice, we will start out with "69, 66, and 62." We have been doing that for years. If we have had any key to what we do, it is in the area of execution. By the time a player gets to play for us, he knows what is expected of him.

It is amazing to me that we still see teams that almost change from week to week. If they continue to change too often, you won't see them around too long. If they continue to change, that staff will be gone, and someone else will be in there.

We have some basic ideas. Our pass protection is the key to everything we do. If the front is odd, we are in a man-blocking scheme. If it is an even front, we zone-block. There are always changes to the rules, but that is pretty basic for us. We always want to block "big on big." By that, I mean linemen blocking linemen and backs blocking on linebackers whenever possible. We always block weak on a 4-4 front.

We have a lot of different sets. We go from two backs, I backs, one back, and a lot of different things. What the defense does and what their tendencies have been are how we determine how to utilize our backs. Basically, we release the flanker, split end, and tight end all the time. At times, we may leave our tight end in to block if we flood the weak side. We have had such great tight ends over the last few years that we have gotten away from leaving him in.

When we come to the line, the center will block weak when he is not covered. That way, we may be able to get the back out to the weak side. I'm not going to get into the protection too much, but if the inside linebacker comes, we base-block. If the outside linebacker comes, we slide. If we don't know what they are doing, we double-read it. Some of this I may try to get back to, depending on the time.

In the individual technique of pass blocking, there are some important things. When the lineman comes out of his stance, he jab-steps to the inside. We always protect the inside first. We honor an inside fake. We never honor an outside fake. The offensive line coach studies the moves of the opponents we play and works with our linemen.

It is important to anticipate but not be overanxious. One of the hardest things to teach an offensive lineman is not to fire out, lunge, or get overanxious. The hands come up, not out. The knees are bent, and the buttocks are lowered. That is hard for the offensive lineman. An offensive lineman has to slide with his feet, never cross over, and never take big steps. They hit and recoil. Their shoulders are square at all times to the line of scrimmage. They deliver a blow and get separation. The defense wants to get a hold of the offensive lineman and get his shoulders turned. Once that happens, he can do anything he wants.

In training and developing our quarterback, we don't fool around with his throwing motion. If you have a young guy and are starting out with him, you can have

 





Page 70

an influence on his throwing motion. I've heard a lot of people talk about quarterback mechanics. They talk about pointing the knees and other things. That is confusing to me. I really believe there are only five things important in throwing the ball.

When you are teaching a kid how to throw, make sure he gets his elbow shoulder high. The best explanation I've ever heard in throwing the ball is as the quarterback starts to throw, he should expose his number to the target. When he throws, he should pronate the hand so that the thumb snaps down and inside.

Make sure he does not overstride. The final thing is to never throw across your body. If he exposes his numbers, it takes care of throwing across the body. He should never let the ball cross his face. That is a way of saying "Don't throw across your body."

The first play we work on is called "69." The set I'll put up here is a pro set with split backs. The split end does a takeoff. The tight end releases upfield to a depth of 7 yards and crosses to a depth of 15 yards. The flanker runs an 18-yard square-in and comes across the field. He can also run a post and then square it in or run a post-corner if he sees the corner is jumping the in route. If we want to run that option, we call "69 Z post-corner."

The linemen block big on big. The center blocks weak. The tailback and fullback have the outside backers. If they come, they block them. If the linebackers drop, they release into the flat.

We have man and zone routes. If you are playing against a zone team, make sure you create a horizontal and vertical stretch. If it is a man route, we use crossing routes or individual cuts.

If you tell your receivers to run a 12-yard curl, they will run it at 9 to 10 yards. We have to stay on our receivers all the time to get the proper depth from our patterns. The defense playing a zone wants to force the offense in. They want to compress the zone and force the receivers to run their routes short or too tight. That is our job, to keep that zone stretched.

For years, the key on this play was the strong safety. If the strong safety went with the tight end, the quarterback read man coverage. He went to the flanker running the 18-yard in. That is a good read, but this is a play we would call against a zone team. The progression for throwing is flanker, tight end, and running back.

From this we call "69 H delay." If the linebackers don't get a good drop, there is a big hole in the middle to hit the tight end. When the linebackers get their drops under the tight end, we delay the running back and bring him out late and under the linebackers. The tailback steps up and waits for two counts. If nobody comes, he trickles out under the linebackers. We do this a lot on possession downs. When we have to have the first down, this is the play we run. Most of our delay patterns are backs coming out of the backfield. If the outside linebacker comes, the back blocks him first, then trickles off.

People began to play zone deep and man to man underneath. We went to "69 H option." On the H option, we look for the halfback all the way. The halfback has no blocking responsibility on this pattern. As soon as the ball is snapped, the halfback goes hard upfield for

 





Page 71

6 yards. If it was a zone defense, he turned and spotted up. As much as we drill and run this play, our backs still want to break the pattern off at 3 and 4 yards. He has to get to 6 yards so the quarterback knows where he is.

The quarterback takes a five-step drop. He gets his depth in his first two steps. The next three steps are gathering steps. When he hits his fifth step, he delivers the ball to the halfback. He can't move around so the quarterback can find him. The halfback spots up between the middle and weak-side linebackers.

The defense knows about the H option. They study our tendencies and have a feeling for when we run the play. The outside linebacker, instead of dropping so deep, drops shallow and tries to squeeze the halfback. When that happens, the tight end becomes the number one receiver.

If the defense showed man coverage, we still run the same patterns. If the outside linebacker blitzes, the halfback knows that probably the middle linebacker has coverage on him. The halfback has a free release. The fullback comes over to take the blocking responsibility of the halfback. The halfback run his 6yard pattern, leans in on the linebacker, and breaks out. He does not spot up on a man coverage. He runs an out cut.

From this play came the most successful running play we have in our offense. It is called "draw trap." This play looks like the H option. The guard, if he is covered, tries to get his man to rush inside. The tackle gives his pass set then comes off for the inside linebacker. The center block backs for the cutoff. The backside guard pulls and traps the first thing to show past the guard. The halfback drives hard as in the H option and blocks the weak linebacker. On the snap of the ball, the fullback takes a step toward the trap and waits. The quarterback brings the ball back, slides it to the fullback, and breaks inside the trap block. This first example is against an even 4-3 front.

Let me show you different ways of blocking it against different fronts. Early on, if the defense got into a Bear front, we had a tendency to automatically drop out of the play. We don't now. Let's look at the odd-50 front. The left tackle takes a hard inside step and invites the tackle to rush outside. After he does that, he comes up on the inside linebacker. The left guard takes his inside step. He and the center have to block the noseguard and backside linebacker. They do it with an area scheme. If the noseguard slants into the strong gap or plays the center head up, the center takes him. If he goes weak, the left guard takes him. The right guard pulls and traps. The right tackle seals inside. The back blocks the weak outside backer. The quarterback and fullback do the same thing.

 





Page 72

We see a lot of 4-4 looks. Here is how we block against it. The left guard and tackle have to block the man on the guard and the offside linebacker. The guard and tackle take their inside steps. If the defensive tackle comes hard inside the guard, the guard blocks him, and the tackle goes for the offside linebacker. If he plays the guard, the tackle blocks him, and the guard comes off on the linebacker. When we first started to run this against this defense, we had the halfback going in to block the onside linebacker. But all that did was muck up the play. We have found the inside linebacker follows the halfback out. Instead of going in on the inside linebacker, the linebacker comes out to the halfback.

What we follow that up with is a "draw trap pass." On this play, everything is blocked the same way. The split end runs a curl pattern. The halfback has a free release and runs to the flat. If the linebacker runs back under the curl, the quarterback hits the halfback. If the linebacker jumps the halfback, the quarterback hits the curl pattern. We key the inside linebacker. He can't be right. Where he goes, we throw opposite.

We run a weak-side sweep. To be frank, this play has not been as consistent as we need it to be. We are going to work harder on this play. We get a lot of the 4-3 look. We played Penn State a few years ago in Provo. We ran the ball 50 times and threw it 20. We didn't have any idea the run would work out that way. Of the 50 runs, 25 were weak-side sweep. The split end cracks on the outside linebacker. The tackle downblocks the man over the guard. The guard pulled for the corner. The halfback chops the defensive end. The center blocks the onside gap and the backside scoops.

We are big on option-type routes for our receivers. We like to run this off the right hash mark. We bring the flanker in motion back to the quarterback. We could line up in the wide slot to the field. The reason we like to motion is so the defense has to tip their coverage. If the corner goes with the motion, we feel that is man coverage, and that is what we want. The fullback has a free release. He runs a 5-and-5 route, that is, 5 yards downfield and 5 yards from the sideline. Once the fullback finds out it is man, he keeps going up the sideline. The tight end takes an inside release and works upfield.

As the quarterback drops, he keys the outside linebacker. If he comes, we have no one to block him. The back is looking at the outside linebacker. If the linebacker blitzes, he gets the ball right now on the hot route. The tight end finds who is picking him up. He carries him downfield 10 yards, leans in, and pressreleases to the outside.

If we read zone coverage, we run zone routes. The fullback has a free release and runs his 5-by-5 route. The flanker reads zone, runs a 6-yard curl, and sets

 





Page 73

down right in the middle of the set. The tight end takes his inside release. He reads zone. He runs his pattern up to 6 yards and hooks outside between the two linebackers. The tight end is the primary receiver on this play. If they jump the tight end, the fullback will be wide open. This basically is the same play as the H option. We call it F option because the flanker is running the choice route.

This next play is called "62 X, Y cross." This Is What I Want we want to do against man coverage. We narrow the split of the split end to 6 or 7 yards from his tackle. The flanker takes a post move. The tight end takes an inside release and comes across at a depth of 5 to 7 yards. The split end comes underneath at a depth of 3 to 5 yards. We want the mesh or cross of our receiver in the middle of the formation. The quarterback reads the free safety. People know that is the first pattern we run against man coverage. They try to hang the weak safety in the cross area and rob the ball. They are taking a gamble by putting their other corner on an island with the flanker. The weak safety hanging in the middle gives the flanker the entire field to work with man coverage. When the quarterback sees the free safety hang in on the cross, he goes downtown to the flanker. Most of the time we win that battle. That is where we work our option route to the flanker. We can give him a post-corner.

There are a number of different ways to run the same play. One way I like to do it is bring the flanker in motion. The split end runs the post route, and the flanker and tight end run the cross. The read is the same. We can set the halfback in the weak slot and run the flanker on the go route. The split end does the post, and the halfback and tight end run the cross. The keys are the same, and the pattern is the same.

Basically, the guy who comes underneath catches the ball as soon as the cross takes place. The underneath receiver starts to float upfield. He doesn't continue his pattern across the field. We run this pattern with all different kinds of combinations. We can take X, Y, and Z on go routes and bring both back out and cross them in the middle.

One final thing here, and then I'll answer any questions you may have. One of the best plays against a zone defense is "all curls." From that we can get into the "Y choice." That is the option route for the tight end. Our outside receivers run a 12- to 14-yard curl route. This is not a hook pattern. As the receiver starts to make his move, he looks at the quarterback.

If there is someone between him and the quarterback, he takes it further inside. That is why it is important to align wide. A zone team will eat you up if you don't get the stretch. He doesn't come down and stop. He works back to the quarterback. We look at the middle

 





Page 74

linebacker in the 4-3, weak-side inside linebacker in the odd front, and weak linebacker in the stack.

The tight end's pattern is 10 to 12 yards deep. If the middle linebacker goes weak, the quarterback goes immediately to the tight end. If the middle linebacker goes to the strong side, the quarterback immediately goes to the weak side and keys the weak-side linebacker. If he hangs on the curl, the quarterback hits the back. If the linebacker jumps the back, he hits the curl of the split end.

Men, it has been a real pleasure to be here. I'll stick around for a bit if any of you would like to come up and ask any questions. Good luck to you. Thanks very much.

Our Best Pass Plays

University of Northern Colorado

Thank you very much. I have to pinch myself every morning to believe that we won the national championship. First, I want to thank the high school coaches from the state of Colorado. Fellows, we won the championship with a bunch of Colorado boys. Thank you very much, Colorado coaches. Out of 100 players on our football team, 87 of them were from the great state of Colorado. Again, thanks. We just recruited 33 more players from the state of Colorado. "Dance with the one that brung you."

I grew up one of 12 children in Lincoln, Nebraska. People ask me why I got into coaching. I have to tell them it was because of the competitiveness that ran in my family. I will tell you one story to illustrate. I will tell you the story about my brothers Jimmy and Johnny. We were playing on a Little League baseball team. We were playing for the city championship. My brother Jimmy was one of those kids who, anytime anything happened that he did not like, would get into a fist fight. If the other team would bean one of our batters, he would get after them. If the other team gave him any reason to get into it, Jimmy would be in the middle of it. That was his style. I prided myself on having a nice, clean uniform after the game. I had my uniform washed before the next game for each game. Jimmy did not have his uniform washed all summer. He was a grub. Our team and coach loved him, and he was a prince of a player to coach. He was everything you would want in a Little League player. However, we got to the city championships, where we got to play under the lights for the first time. The first time we came to bat, naturally they hit Jimmy with a pitch. Jimmy ran out to the mound and lit into the pitcher. Both benches cleared, but they threw Jimmy out of the game. The coach loved Jimmy so much, he let him go down and coach third base the rest of the game.

The game came down to the last inning, and I had my chance to win the game. The bases were loaded, and the score was tied. There was no one out. I looked down to first base but saw no signal. I looked down to third base and again saw no signal. I was just waiting to make contact to win the game. The pitcher started his windup, and I looked down and saw a runner breaking from third base. My first thought was, "Did I miss the signal? Was a squeeze play on?" The pitcher speeded up his windup and threw the ball home. The catcher grabbed the ball and put the tag on the runner. The umpire yelled, "You're out!" My brother Jimmy got up and yelled, ''You can't throw me out. I am the third base coach." Competitor! They made him go sit with my mom after that.

I do have one story to tell you before we get into X's and O's. There were four old men who were golfing partners. The four golfers had a pact. Whoever died first would find some way to get back to the others and let them know how the hereafter was. Winter came, and they quit playing golf. That winter, Ernie passed away. Spring came, and the three old men went out to play golf for the first time. After they teed off, they heard a strange voice: "Hey, fellows!" They recognized the voice. "Is that you, Ernie?" The voice replied, "Yes, it is Ernie. Did you forget about our deal?'' The guys said, "No, we did make a deal. Tell us, Ernie, what is it all about?" This was his reply: "You can't believe it. You get up in the morning, and the first thing you do is have sex. Then you go for a walk. When you come back, you have a drink and then eat. Then you have sex again and then relax awhile. Then you have a drink, then eat, and then have sex again. All day long all you do is eat, drink, have sex, and take a walk. It goes on day after day." The other golfers said, "Wow! Ernie, we knew heaven would be great, but we had no idea it would be that great." Ernie replied, "Heaven? Hell, I am in Billings, Montana." Reincarnation! Come on, guys.

Now that I am getting a little older, I try to sneak away at noon to take a little nap during our fall practice two-a-day practices. I wanted to stay fresh so I could stay

in our staff meeting late into the night. One day I went home and had no more laid down when the phone rang. I have a little dog named Patty Murphy. The phone call was from my neighbor Mrs. Scott. She said, "Coach, your dog Patty Murphy is over here on top of my little dog Pepi. "Pepi was her show dog. She had the dog registered and had all of the papers to prove her pedigree. She did not want my dog having sex with her dog. I said, "Mrs. Scott, just grab Patty Murphy by his tail and pull him off of Pepi. You know Patty Murphy. He will not hurt you." She replied, "I just tried that, and it does not work." I said, "Why don't you grab a bucket of water and throw it on the dogs. That will work.'' She said, "I just tried that, and it doesn't work.'' I said, "OK, I know what to do. Mrs. Scott, take the telephone over and set it next to the dogs. Hang up the phone, and I will call you back. Let the phone ring three or four times." She said, "Will that work?" I replied, "I don't know for sure, but it just worked at my house."

When you win, you get a lot of things going for you. They raised our recruiting budget after we won the championship. Now we have the third highest budget in the state. The University of Colorado is first, Mullen High School is the second, and now we are the third highest. I am hoping we will pass Mullen High up soon. Mullen did a good job this year, so I can joke with them.

I want to share a couple of things with you. Most everyone knows where we are and what we are doing. We have about 10,000 students. The best-known person from our school is James Michener, the Pulitzer Prize author. He is still alive. Those of you who have been on campus know that Michener Library is named in his honor. He wrote 
Centennial.

We have a great school. This is my 10th year at the University of Northern Colorado. I flat love the school. Greeley, Colorado, is a great town. We are the summer home of the Denver Broncos. If you have not done so, you should get up there and check them out. They have been very gracious toward coaches. It is a lot of fun to visit with them. We built a new stadium two years ago. We are 13-0 in our new facility.

I am not going to tell you that we have reinvented the wheel. The best thing I have done is to hire good people. I learned this at a young age. This is true if you are hanging out, playing games, or coaching. Get yourself good people. I have a great staff. They are getting the job done for us. We have about 14 other coaches on our staff. I have not coached a position in the last several years. I have been fortunate to move around to each group. I have delegated a lot of things to my staff. I have been very fortunate that the guys have carried it out. It has allowed me to do a lot of other things. I focus a lot of my time on recruiting and fund-raising, and I get very involved in the motivational part of it. I love working with our coaching staff.

Talking about our offense, philosophically we want balance. A lot of you remember the old UNC that could win the league passing every year. Those teams took a lot of pride in the passing game. I think that is a great way to move the football. Now, the passing game only does not wash in our conference. In the WAC that philosophy works. They have a track meet in about every game. In our league it is just about a fistfight every week. Even though we were national champions, we still lost three games in our conference. There are 10 teams in our conference. I like to think of our conference as the Big Ten of Division II. If you can power your way through the conference and make the final 16 tournament, you should have an excellent chance to still be standing when the tournament is over. Our league definitely prepared us for the national championship. We had a lot of injuries, but we made it through the year.

We really feel we must have balance in our offense. We work really hard at running the football. We are still a two-back attack. This has been my philosophy ever since I played back in 1959. I am a big-time fan of Bob Devaney of Nebraska. He was the coach who came to Lincoln when I was about 12 years old. He got Nebraska off the ground, and he did it by first playing good defense and then by running the football.

By running the football, you learn to be tough. Your defense learns how to stop the run by working against your offense each day. I am not going to say that we hammer the eight-man front all day. We feel we work harder than most teams. We keep two backs in the game most of the time. We are a two-back attack

 





Page 77

about 85 percent of the time. We want a good hardnosed fullback. The hard-nosed fullbacks are hard to find today. Some people prefer another wideout instead of the hard-nosed fullback. We like the hardnosed type of players. To me, it is what football is all about. As Buck Nystrom would say, "It is a tough game for tough people." I believe that way myself.

In our offense I would like to think we could complete 50 percent of our passes. I would like to average 4 yards per carry. Those may be lofty figures. In our season this past year, we rushed for 2776 yards, and had 48 touchdowns. We did play 15 games. We were able to pass for 2491 yards. That is good balance, as far as I am concerned. We scored 20 touchdowns passing. Those may not be lofty figures, but if you are playing good defense as we did this year, it isn't bad. Our defense gave up 88 yards per game rushing.

In having a balanced attack, you can protect your defense. By that, I mean that we really work hard on the turnover category. We cover the end of the football with our middle finger. We pull our elbow down on the football. When we are in traffic, we put two hands on the football. We work with our quarterbacks in making good decisions. We will punt most of the time when in doubt about what to do. We try to make our opponents look at 70 to 80 yards every time they touch the football. We are playing a good layer defense, and by that I mean a four-man front, with three or five underneath with a two-deep secondary. We have three layers that you have to make it through before you hit a big play on us. We do not want to give up big plays on defense. We do not play a lot of man-to-man coverage. We just want to belly up and keep everything in front of us. Again, that is the philosophy that I believe in, and I have coached that way ever since day one. We try to make it work in Greeley, and so far it is working. Again, the better the athletes you have, the better it works. That is where we are coming from, philosophically.

I want to talk about the defensive problems that we are seeing now in our league. Teams that we are playing are going to an eight-man front. I think Buddy Ryan used this type defense and made it popular. The defense has their ears laid back, and they are lined up in a two-point stance. You do not know who is coming and who isn't. You have to anticipate an eight-man rush a lot of the time. You will get a lot of eight-man rush. Some of you may call it the full-court press, or max blitz, or whatever.

Last spring, our staff discussed our problems in handling the eight-man front. Our offensive coordinator, Kay Dalton, suggested that we go to the option. He knew we were not handling the eight-man front totally with the passing game. We needed to find a way to slow down the eight-man front.

We went to Lincoln and spent two days with an old friend of mine by the name of Coach Milt Tenopir of Nebraska. I knew Milt when he was a GA at Nebraska. I actually knew Coach Osborne when he was a GA, believe it or not. I spent some time with the Nebraska coaches and came back and put in some option plays in our offense. It is not our bread-and-butter offense. You would not believe how much it helped us this past year. We were not very good at hitting slant or fade routes, getting the ball to our backs out of the backfield, or tight end in pressure situations. If we did hit the back or the tight end, we were not making enough yards to hurt the blitz.

Now when we see the eight-man front or the blitz package, we kind of spit into our hands and say, "Oh goody, here we go." The option helped us win the national championship. We block the play just as we do on our outside zone play. That leaves one man left, and we pitch or keep on the option off that last man. If you have a quarterback who can run the option, it puts a hell of a bind on the defense. The small amount of time that we did run the option, it helped us a lot.

I guess it is true that the more we change, the more we remain the same. When I came into the game, power football was popular. Woody Hayes was at Ohio State; Bob Devaney was at Wyoming and later Nebraska. He was having success with a full-house set, and Duffy Daugherty at Michigan State was having success with the unbalanced line and power football. Then we developed the I formation. To me, the I formation is power football. Then we started seeing the option. Other teams adopted the option

 





Page 78

until it was the thing to do. Then the option faded away, and the trend of "pass, pass, pass" came into being. Now we see great corners who can cover one on one. The defense can bring unbelievable pressure on your quarterback. They try to knock the hell out of your quarterback every time he throws the ball. I have a feeling that the option is coming back into football. It was real good to us last year.

We run the inside zone, which is a power play to us. We double-team at the point of attack. One of the two will try to come off on a linebacker. We run our outside zone, and we run our option plays almost the same way as the outside zone plays. We run the lead draw. To me, it is perhaps our most successful play. It is right up the middle. I believe the reason that we are having success is because most teams have gone to a 4-3 defense. The lead draw has been really good. We attack the 3 technique and get a lead back up inside. If you have a good blocking fullback who can get on the linebacker, you turn people the way they want to go. The defense gets in the rush lanes and comes very hard. The lead draw has been good against that defense.

We will run the trap play. With everyone rushing so hard, we will run the trap as a "check with me" type play. We run the inside trap and the G trap. Both of these plays have been good to us. These are the type of plays that are coming back that were not very popular for a while. We have found that the zone plays and the trap plays are good package plays against the pressure defense or the eight-man front defense.

We do run some counter plays as well. We run some play-action passes, and we do run some three-, five-, and seven-step drop passing game. We have a lot of offense.

I want to take you through four passes that were really good for us this past year. When we run the zone to the outside, we have a hard time with the strong safety filling so fast. We run the play just as we would the zone play and fake the ball to the tailback. We run a 17-yard post route to our Z back. We call the play "pass 38 Z post." The 38 is for our running play. We add the Z post for the pass play. Everyone blocks down. If the strong safety bites and comes down, the quarterback reads him first. If the strong safety bites, we will take a shot at it and see if we can't hit the Z back on the post route. The Z back has to get a depth of 17 yards to keep the free safety from getting to the ball. If he runs a shorter route, the free safety can get it.

PASS 38Z POST

Now give the corner credit, and say he hangs back deep. Our fullback usually blocks the strong safety on the 38 play. Now he runs what we call a swing route down the sideline. We have seven-man protection up front. Now the tailback will help us with the strong safety blitz. The quarterback checks number one first. If the free safety bites, we will throw the post route. If the free safety hangs and the corner hangs, which they normally do, we will hit our fullback on the swing route to the flat. That swing route has been really good for us. We have made a lot of big plays off that one play.

We have made a lot of yardage out of a simple pass play we call our angle play. We simply dump the ball off to our back coming out of the backfield. We like to run the play in the middle of the field. Our protection is a six-man scheme. We run the play when we face a two-deep secondary. Most of the time we want to throw underneath. We like this play against dropping linebackers. BYU has made a living with this play. It is a five-step drop for the quarterback. As the quarterback reads the linebacker, he tries to dump the ball to the back swinging out of the backfield. The back releases to a point 3 yards outside the tight end,

 





Page 79

plants, and then works on a 45-degree angle back toward the ball. Most of the time, the linebacker drops out of that area. We drop the ball in the area where the linebacker was at the snap of the ball.

ANGLE PASS

We do not want the quarterback to stand and hold that football forever if the back is covered. It is hard to pass-protect, so we know we have to get rid of the ball. If we get man to man, we still have had luck with the angle. The reason is because we run so many arrow routes outside. Our tight end breaks down the middle. If it is a two-deep, the tight end goes deep. Against a three-deep, he will sit down in front of the safety. Most of the time we have passed the ball to the back against zone defenses. We did get a touchdown throwing the ball to our Z back out of this play.

This next play was taken from the Denver Broncos. I do not know whether they have run it recently. We call it fire boot pass. It takes advantage of the quarterback coming outside. It has been a good play for us. It is a bootleg-type play. We block down flush on the strong side and pull the off guard. The secondary gets a run read on the strong side from the tight end. We run a 12-yard out route on that side. The tailback runs an inside route and makes a fake inside. He picks up anything coming through. The quarterback turns and looks at the back. There is not much of a fake. We just front out, sprint five steps, and set up behind the tackle. It is a pre-snap read. If it is a three-deep secondary, we run the out route to the Z back at 12 yards.

FIRE BOOT PASS

If we get a cover five or a two-deep, the quarterback knows he will not go to the Z back. He will take his five-step drop and look for the X end on the sit route inside. The quarterback knows from where the free safety lines up what he is going to do with the ball before it is even snapped.

Now, we have another phase of the play. We called this play "continental" when I was growing up. Now, we run the same play, but this time we bring the left halfback out of the backfield on the swing route behind the X end. He comes out and up, getting depth as he widens. That play has been so good to us over the years. We used this pass in the playoffs against Clarion State in Pennsylvania. We did not score on it because our quarterback wanted to make sure we completed the play, so he did not lead the receiver far enough, but we scored on the very next play. It is blocked just like the bootleg.

FIRE BOOT CONTINENTAL PASS

We do run some two-tight end plays. This is our four vertical route. We call the play F delay. Our back steps up in the protection, but he will continue through the ine and sit down over the center. If we are getting a 

 





Page 80

soft zone, the play goes to the tailback. This is not a "Hail Mary" play. The wideouts run 20-yard go routes, but we are not trying to throw the bomb. We are trying to get a stretch against a three-deep scheme. If it is against man-to-man, we are looking for a mismatch. As I said, if it is against a really soft zone, the best bet is to dump the ball to the tailback on the F delay. If it is man-to-man, the tailback has to break one way or the other. He has a choice to go right or left on the break.

F DELAY

We would designate one of the two tight ends or the H back, if he is in the slot, to break to the middle of the field. He would break to the open spot against a two-deep scheme. If it is man, it becomes a footrace. If we have swinger called, the wideouts run a comeback route.

I am going to add my favorite pass play of all times. This will be my 25th year of coaching. I have always liked the curl-flat route. As a quarterback, when I played, I felt it was the easiest pass to read for the quarterback. You get a stretch to the flat, and you have someone in the middle who can work back to the quarterback. It is an easy throw. You do not have to have a strong arm to throw the ball. It is not a big timing route. I have always been a big fan of the curl-flat route. Kay Dalton put in a little different wrinkle on the play. I am sure some of you have used this, but I had never used it. We call the play "Hank." Our tight end hooks up over the ball at 8 yards. The wideouts run a curl at 16 yards. We get our fullback on the stretch route to the flat. The tailback sets to block and then runs a scat route. It is six-man protection.

Hank Pass Route

Our quarterback comes back on a five-step drop, and our tight end runs the 8-yard curl right in front of the quarterback. He sits in between the linebackers. If it is against a 4-3, he will try to get away from the middle linebacker. The quarterback takes a five-step drop, and if the end is open, it shows right now. If the tight end is open, we get him the ball. It is an easy throw.

The defense will sit on the tight end. Now we go to our curl-flat read. Most quarterbacks want to throw the ball down the field. Most defenses will play the deep route and give you the short or flat area. You have to throw to the flat area until the defense takes it away.

The only way that the defense can take all three receivers away on the strong side is to come hard with the blitz with tight coverage. If we see the Mike coming hard, we will work the back side of Hank. The defense will be short on the back side if they are playing zone. I like the play because it shows early, and it is a relatively easy pass to throw.

Now I want to show you these five plays on tape.

Defensive Line Techniques

Ohio State University

It is a privilege for me to be here. I want to talk to you people about defensive line play. I have had a chance to work in some great programs for some great coaches. I had a chance to work with Dennis Stoltz at Bowling Green, Don James at the University of Washington, and John Cooper at Ohio State. I've been at Ohio State only one year, but it is a great learning experience working with a coach like John Cooper. The defensive coordinator is Fred Pagac. He has helped me a lot, and I have learned a lot of football from Fred.

Fred is a little different. Anyone who has followed Ohio State knows they have been pretty much a read-type defense. They have been a "bend but don't break" type of defense over the years. When Fred took over this last year, he kind of rolled the dice a little. He is a get-after-them type of guy. If you make a mistake, you make a mistake.

Let me start by telling you that we had some great football players. I think everyone in this room probably knows that. We had an outstanding defensive football team this year at Ohio State. I was fortunate to walk into that situation. We had four guys up front, and three of them will probably be drafted. One of them will be a first-round pick. We had three linebackers that were outstanding. Two were seniors who had started for three years. The middle linebacker was a freshman and probably as good as any linebacker I've ever seen. Our corners were outstanding, and we had a couple of safeties that could get it done. We had a great football team and could do a lot of things.

As we went through the year, our philosophy changed a little. We started out the year as a slide defense with a reduction toward the tight-end side. Throughout the year we changed up and played a lot of "Ohio defense." The Ohio defense is a Bear defense where we are flatout after you. We also played a lot of weak reduction, which we didn't think we were going to play at all. Things happened during the year that really helped us out. We found out that we had two corners who could play man to man. We had a great corner who was probably as good as anybody in the country. The guy on the other side was just about as good. When we found out that we had corners who could cover people, it made our life easier. We became a blitzing, attacking football team. We also had a free safety who developed the nickname of "Wacko." He was a blitz guy. I've found out over the years that if you find a guy who likes to blitz, send him. Every time we sent this guy, he made something happen.

I'm going to talk about defensive line play. I'm kind of the brunt of everyone's jokes at Ohio State. They say that all I have to do is take care of A and B gaps and they'll do everything else. There are four areas I'm going to hit on really quickly.

I think the front four is the most critical part of any defensive unit. There are two things they have to do. They have to control the run and get pressure on the quarterback. I've been in this situation before. If you have to blitz to get pressure or stop the run, you will get burnt eventually. This year we had a front four that could get pressure. When we brought linebackers or the free safety, they created havoc in the backfield.

I think the next point is the most important thing. This is the thing I say most to the defensive line: Beat the blocker. That is the name of the game. The first thing a young defensive lineman wants to do is make a play. As coaches, we have to make them understand that if they want to make a play, they have to beat the blocker. That is the first thing I tell them. Someone is going to block you. Then I go through the offensive play book. I show them in that book that they are not going to leave any linemen unblocked. That is where I start the progression.

 





Page 82

There are three things that can happen to defensive linemen. They are going to use a base block, reach block, or cutoff block against him. If the defensive linemen can defeat the block, fight pressure, and get across pressure, that will take you to the ball, where you can make plays. The first thing that young lineman wants to do is to rise up to find the ball. He wants to make a play. The first thing he knows, the offensive lineman is blocking his butt off. The example is two boxers in the ring. If we are equal, and I'm not watching the other boxer, who is going to win the fight? The defensive lineman is going to get killed if his focus is on the quarterback or running back. The offensive lineman's focus is on the defender. I have to get them to focus on the blocker.

If the guy across from you leaves, there is someone else coming to block you. He will get a down, fold, or trap block. Once the guy across from you leaves, the next guy coming is the guy the defender has to defeat. If it is a trap, he has to wrong-arm it and spill. If it is a down block, he has to get upfield or across the face. If he can beat the blocker, he can make plays.

Should a defender attack upfield or sit on the line of scrimmage and read? When I went to Bowling Green, we were strictly read defenders. We were in a parallel stance and were not going to get reached. When I went to Washington, I got more into getting upfield. Now we want to be able to do both. I'm convinced we have to do both. We have to be able to get up the field and come backdoor on all down blocks. We also have to be able to come cross-face on the line of scrimmage.

If I am a tackle over a guard who pulls, what do I do when the down block comes? In our game plan, we are going to have two ways of playing it. We are either going up the field and coming backdoor, or we are going across the face. If the offensive tackle knows the defensive tackle is attacking upfield, he takes a flat step to the line every time to get the defense walled off. But on the other hand, if the defensive tackle is always sitting on the line of scrimmage, the offensive tackle gets more depth on his charge.

What we teach is two calls. We have a red-and-green call. The green call is go. We are going upfield as hard as we can. If we get the down block, we are going backdoor. We grab cloth, swim, and come down the line of scrimmage behind the blocker.

If we have a red call, we sit on the line of scrimmage. If we get the down block, we strike and fight across face to get inside-out on the ball. Against Arizona State in the Rose Bowl, we always played red unless we were in a nickel defense. The reason for that was their counter play. They ran that play better than anyone I've seen. We wanted to stay on the line of scrimmage. Our 3 techniques made more plays than anyone because they thought he was coming upfield.

At Ohio State we basically have three fronts. We play the Bear front and the reduction to both sides. We call them slide, tight, and Ohio defense. Off each one of those defenses we have a front-line movement. That lets us change a gap for any defensive lineman. We have games to stunt the interior four defensive linemen. We also have blitzes off each one of those. This gives us a multiple look.

I know you guys don't want to listen to my philosophy. So I'll cover it quickly. It is not too different from most people's. But I do think this is important. I spend as much time with the players with this as I do with technique. One of the things we did this year was blitz a lot. Every time we blitzed, we twisted. I've never done that as much as we did this year. Our philosophy was to twist two down guys and tie up three guys trying to block them. Let me give you an example.

Let's take the noseguard and the 3-technique tackle. If we were coming with a Mike or Buck linebacker blitz, we twisted these two guys. We felt that if it took the two guards and the center to block the nose and 3 technique, no one was coming free. The only problem was the defensive linemen were not getting any sacks. That goes back to our first philosophical thought: The team comes first. We may not make the sacks, but the team does.

 





Page 83

If you are going to play defensive line at Ohio State, you have to get after it. Activity is important for us. From when the ball is snapped until the whistle blows, these guys better be busting it. We do two things to help our activity. We are going to be in great condition, and we are going to keep fresh people in the game. If we have guys of equal ability, we will substitute more. We tell them to go three plays all out, and then we bring in the next guy, who does his three plays. This year we had four great players before there was a drop-off in talent. We didn't play our 2s very much. We went with the 1s. They had to be in great physical shape and very disciplined to the ball. The game that won us the Big Ten championship came at Indiana. We had a defensive end get up off the ground, pursue to the other side of the field, pick up a fumble, and return it for a touchdown. He actually picked the fumble up off an Indiana player's back and returned it.

The evaluation of a coach is whether his players improve. I always got a little nervous if I had a player who wasn't better the second game than he was the first. If he doesn't improve as the season goes on, that comes back to the coach. If you are working that kid every day with reps and techniques, he should get better. I emphasize that we have to get better every game and our last game better be our best.

Repetition is the name of the game. The more you can rep it, the better you are going to be. It is monotonous and boring. We try to use different drills to break it up. Our guys must see a reach block a thousand times. They see the down block a thousand times. We do it a million times if they need it.

We feel that we have to do a great job with adjustment. We have to adjust during a game. I can remember two games in my coaching career where we didn't do a good job of adjusting, and we lost the game. After we saw the film, it was too late. We have to adjust in advance in the game.

We were fortunate this year. We had guys who were students of the game. If they were not in class, they were watching tape of the opponents or their drill work. There is no excuse for missed assignments. I've been places where we had to prod those guys to get them to watch tape. They have to execute. They have to know what their assignment is and execute it. There is zero tolerance for making a mental mistake. I've never heard Coach Pagac yell at a guy for making a physical mistake, as long as it was aggressive.

Football is not going to be all good. You are going to have some adversity. Some things are going to go wrong during the course of a game. The last thing I need are guys coming off the field complaining. Against Purdue the first two times they had the ball, they threw two bombs. It was 0-14 before we knew it. I've been around some teams when things started to get hairy and panic set in. That is where I give Coach Pagac and Coach Cooper credit. They didn't panic. We had three quarters to play.

One of the biggest distractions you can have is players playing for you who are always in trouble. When I get together with my players, I tell them, "Here is the policy. I don't set them. They are Coach Cooper's policies. I work for him, these are his policies, and you are going to follow them. If you don't want to follow them, you don't play." You get that ironed out at the beginning. If not you can have a coach-player problem when you have a game coming up. You don't need those distractions.

The last thing is this. I expect you to win and be excellent. If you want the same thing, then we will always be on the same page. You always have players who think that you are on them all the time. Just have them look at this philosophy. If they don't want the same thing, I'll get off them, but they won't play.

The next thing I want to do is go through what I call "10 vital techniques." If you are going to be a good defensive lineman, you better be able to do these 10 things. Number one, and probably the toughest thing to do, is stance. Stance is number one in my opinion. You have to get in a good football stance. We start

 





Page 84

out with the flat back, toes upfield, and good balance. As the season goes on, players get lazy. A good stance will make you a better football player.

In our base stance, or red stance, we are heel to toe in stagger. We want 60 percent of our weight on our hands. I want their backs flat enough that I could eat dinner off them. However, I want the butt up a little.

If I get into the green stance, I want the stagger elongated. The hand is a little more in front. The feet are a little closer together. We are in a sprinter's stance somewhat. That lets us explode off the ball and get upfield.

The next thing is alignment. This is something we do a lot of. Basically, I have four alignments. I have what I call head, split, shade, and foot. The head is aligned head on head. The split is splitting the man right down the middle. That means inside foot splits the crotch of the offensive man. The shade is my foot on his inside foot. I am not head up, but cheating a little to the outside. The last one is foot, which puts my inside foot on his outside foot. That is as wide as we get. This is a way to adjust the players' technique. If a player comes off and tells me he is getting reached, all I have to tell him is go to a foot alignment.

The distance off the line depends on the skill of a defensive lineman. The better he is, the closer he gets to the line. Our younger players start out back off the ball. That gives them time to read and keeps them from getting reached so easily.

The third thing is assignment. We call our two inside rushers power rushers. The two ends are speed rushers. We paint on our field our rush lanes. We run stunts and twists on these lines to make sure we stay in lanes as we rush the passer. I've seen a lot of great pass rushers who don't get too many sacks, but they get upfield in their lanes. That is what we emphasize. I start off with nothing but the bull rush. The pass-rush lane is their assignment.

The noseguard is the guy who gets beat up by the center and two guards in the pass rush. This year the noseguard could make a "me-you" call to the 3-technique tackle. That exchanged gaps and lanes in the pass rush. On the "you" call, the noseguard would step into the center-guard gap and then rush outside the guard. The tackle starts outside the guard, throws, and comes back inside in the face of the quarterback.

The fourth thing is get-off. This probably is the most important thing we do. We want the player's hand moving when the ball is moving. We have to get off on the football. That is the first thing we do in practice. We try to teach them to go on the movement of the ball, not sound. If you saw the Rose Bowl, we jumped on sound about three times, and I almost got fired. We watch the football.

We do a drill to work on this. A lot of the pro teams do this. We align our defensive linemen 5 yards away from the offensive linemen. All the offensive linemen do is back-paddle. The defensive linemen sprint to them as fast as they can. They just tap them. We make a little game of it. The defense has to tap the offense before he gets 10 yards. The loser does up-downs. The whole idea is the get-off.

The strike-and-blow delivery defeats the offensive blocker. If the blocker weighs 320 pounds and the defensive player weighs 250 pounds, if you take him on square, he will beat your ass. We have to change the direction of the offensive blocker. That is where the bend in the knees and strike up through the target come into play. When we hit the sled, I do a jab-dip-rip drill. They take two steps and jab the bag. I say dip. They have to bend their knees down as far as they can go. I let them sit there for about five seconds. That gives them the feel of bending their knees. Then I say rip. They explode up through the sled.

We want to put our eyes in the V of the neck. That is our aiming point. We want shoulder pad under shoulder pad. We try to bring the hands under both armpits, bend the knees, explode up through the neck, and lock up. We have to stop him on the line.

After the blow delivery comes extension of the arms. That leads to number 6, separation from the block. The

 





Page 85

defensive lineman has to lock out his arm. It has gotten so bad with the holding calls. The referee calls holding once a game, and that is it. In our league we are getting held every play. When we run scout teams in practice, I tell them to hold our defense.

The seventh vital technique is disengagement. That is throwing the linemen away to get off the block. We work really hard on throwing the man. If you try to move before you disengage, the blocker will be right on you. We run a simple drill to practice this. I have a blocker in front of me. The defensive man has his hand under the armpits and locked out. All I do is step one way or the other. The defensive man throws the offense off the other way. It's a simple drill.

The eighth thing is pursuit. This year we did a cut-up of every play that gained 10 yards or more against our defense. There were 27 plays in 11 games where the opponent gained 10 yards or more. Out of that 27, 6 were reverses, 5 of them were against our second team or others. That brings it down to maybe 17 plays in 11 games for 10 yards or more. I think that is pretty good. Our guys run to the football. We talk about relentless pursuit. We run a lot of pursuit drills. We constantly harp on it. The hardest thing I have to do is to get men on the line to run after a pass. To do this, the two most important things are attitude and effort.

The ninth thing is tackling. I'm not going to talk a lot about that. The one thing I will say is about fine-tune drills. We want to tackle a guy high from behind. That prevents a quarterback from throwing the ball, or it may cause a fumble. I do a drill at least once a week on this technique. Maybe it will happen in a game because I worked on it.

Another drill that is a fine-tuning drill is called the "bend drill." How many times have you seen a defensive end get a great pass rush, beat the blocker, but end up running by the quarterback because his momentum carried him wide? That is centrifugal force. We run a drill and time our ends on running around a cone and bending end. They have to dip their shoulder, touch grass, and run all the way around. We do it from both directions. That may be the skill that strips the ball from the quarterback.

One tackling drill I do every day is work on a quarterback breaking the pocket. I put a manager back behind a pass-rush drill. I use the quickest man I can find. We run our pass-rush drill, using our techniques to get free. Once we break free, the manager scrambles outside. I want them adjusting their paths and making an effort to get him. I don't want them to break free, break down, and sneak up on him. I want them coming hard. I call this the "brain drill" because as that defensive man is breaking free, I want him thinking that the quarterback is going to run somewhere. I don't want him to just rush upfield like a big lug. He has to think after he beats the block to get the quarterback.

These fine-tune drills are realistic. They are things that players are going to see in the games. I want them to have worked on them so they can handle them in the game.

The last thing is react to schemes. Every team that you play is going to be good at two or three schemes. We are going to identity the three or four things they do best. We are going to work like crazy on them that week in practice. Those are the 10 vital techniques we have to get across to our kids. When you put that all together, you have yourself a football player.

The most important part of the game to me right now is pass rush. You have to get pressure on the quarterback with your front four. I work four areas of pass rush. I work the get-off. That is the green stance. Next is the setup. This is the one I've tried to work on over the years. The next area is the move. You can use the rip, over, or bull rush. The last thing is the countermove. That is how I break down the pass rush.

Let me talk briefly about the setup. What we are trying to do is get you off balance. Every offensive coach in the country tries to keep his offensive linemen in a balanced frame all the time. When they are in that stance, they are good. It is hard to get around him when

 





Page 86

he is balanced up. We can't let him do that. For the first three series of every game, we are going to bull rush. The first thing I want that offensive lineman to do is to start to lean. If you hit that guy enough under his chin, he starts to lean into you. When he does, your pass-rush techniques are going to work.

When we bull-rush, we have to feel the offensive linemen. I saw this in a 49er camp. They blindfold their pass rushers. The offensive blocker retreats in the bull rush. At some point the offensive lineman has to make a stand to keep from being pushed back into the quarterback. When he locks back and leans into the defense is when we pull him forward and go around him. We don't use the blindfold, but we do close our eyes. It is the feel they have to recognize. The setup is the bull rush, which is designed to get the guy leaning forward.

With our 3 technique and noseguard, we use a head fake. All they do is jab to the outside, club to the inside, and rip underneath. We are trying to move the offensive linemen's weight to one side or the other. In the power rush, we work the offensive linemen to the outside of our pass lane, then rip and come inside. We do these things within the confines of our lanes.

Pass rush is attitude, effort, and toughness. Football is a physical game. We always look for those types of guys.

In the drill is where you have to be creative. This is where football gets boring. I have never had a player who liked individual drills. They want to scrimmage. The first drill that I like to use is a pass-rush drill. This is a toughness drill. Sometimes I have trouble with the head coach over this drill because it gets out of hand at times. I want to find out how tough he is, whether he wants to get to the quarterback, and whether he won't give up. It is also a good conditioning drill.

The drill has two offensive blockers on one pass rusher. The first lineman engages the defensive rusher at the line of scrimmage. The second blocker waits in reserve. If the rusher gets past the first blocker, he has to take on the second blocker. The first man now drops in back to take on the rusher again. The drill continues until the rusher gets to the quarterback or the whistle blows. If the rusher gets there, the offense has to do 20 up-downs. You can tell a lot about your players from this drill.

In this next drill I have an offensive man on a defensive man. I use two dummies and two backs on each. The ball carrier is in the tailback position. All blocks are base blocks. I point to the back who I want to carry the ball. On the snap of the ball, the offensive man tries to block the defensive man's butt off. The back runs through the bags. The defensive man has to use his vital techniques to get to the ball carrier. The first thing he has to do is neutralize the blocker. In the beginning, most of the defenders are trying to see which back is coming. They are not focused on the blocker and end up in my lap.

The first thing you are going to find out is where that defender is looking. I tell the offense that holding is legal, so he grabs the defender. If the offense can hold him, he didn't lock out. The young guy finally gets the lockout completed and goes for the tackle. The offensive man will bury him, because he did disengage. You can see all the mistakes from the results that occur. This drill teaches the progression to the tackle. We don't put the backs on the ground. We form tackle.

I can stand behind the drill and see all the vital techniques. We videotape this drill. The biggest problem they all have is trying to watch the ball carrier. This probably is the best drill we do. It covers everything.

I adjust the depth of the backs and the width of the dummies to the skill of the players. For the younger players, I tighten the dummies and move the ball carrier back. With our older players, I challenge them. I put the dummies wider and the backs closer. I determine that by how happy I am or how much I want them to do well or not so well. With the young guys, the ball carriers are about 8 yards deep. The great defensive linemen that I've had fight pressure naturally. They are instinctive. Wrestlers are good at that. I love to coach wrestlers on the defensive line because they have a knack for fighting pressure.

 





Page 87

The next drill I use is a repetition drill, working on schemes. I line up the guys across the field with offense on one side and defense on the other. I stand behind the defense and give them commands. I tell them they have their left arm free. They take two steps, getting the pad under pad. I check each of them as they go. It is rapid fire. In the course of five minutes I can get through base, reach, and cutoff blocks.

After that I work on low blocks. I work on everything that might happen to them in a game. Then we go to stunts. I tell them they have their left arm free, slant right. I coach the offense to do certain things to the defense. I tell them to scoop on their steps and watch the reaction of the defense. Then I line them up and we pass-rush. So in 5 to 10 minutes, I can get in all the situations that they see in a game.

This drill goes along with the bend drill. I put them on the line. They have to sprint upfield, bend around the cone, and dive on the dummy. I time this to see how fast they can get it done. There is nothing wrong with diving. They come around the horn and dive in on the dummy. That forces them to angle in.

When we play the low block, I want the eyes of the defensive linemen down on the blocker. What they want to do is hit them on the back. That is being lazy and not wanting to bend their knees. I want the hands in front of them, keeping him away from their feet. If the defensive guy is focused on the ball carrier, he'll get cut. If the blocker goes down, the defender goes down with him.

We don't see the double-team block much any more. The block we are seeing is the chip off to the linebacker. If the defender drops to the ground on a chip block, that is what the offense wants him to do. We stay on our feet until we feel pressure coming.

We don't break down when we tackle. If we break down on a good back, it won't make any difference. We probably aren't going to make the tackle anyway. I tell them to go get them. If we miss, make them readjust their movement. We are going to attack everyone. The only thing different is that the second guy in strips the ball. Our approach is to attack and go make it happen.

Let me show you the three fronts we run. This first one is the reduced front weak side. We shade the noseguard to the weak side. The ends are in a 5 and a 7 technique. The tackle plays a 3 technique to the tight-end side. We play with the Will linebacker to the weak side, the Mike linebacker in the middle, and the Buck linebacker to the tight-end side.

Our best run defense was what we called ''tight.'' We played the nose in a strong shade to the tight end. The tackle played a 2 technique to the split-end side. Our strong-side defensive end was in a 4 technique, and the weak-side was in a 5 technique. The Will linebacker played on the tight end. The Mike linebacker played a 3 technique strong. The Buck linebacker played a 2 stack to the weak side. The tackle slanted

 





Page 88

into the A gap weak. Mike and Buck linebackers fastflowed to the strong side, and the free safety played the weak-side B gap for the cutback. That was our 1st and 10 defense.

The Bear defense is probably our best defense. We played this a ton in the bowl game. As far as making things happen, this is our best defense. We have a good front five who got off on the ball. We twist our inside people and blitz like crazy from this. We played manfree in the secondary. The other thing we did off this was to show the Bear, drop out, and play zone. We slanted back to the strong side, and the defense ended up being the tight front. The Will linebacker would drop, and we played zone out of it. In the bowl game we played this with our nickel defense.

Gentlemen, thank you for your attention.

Multiple Defenses and Stunts

East Bank High School, West Virginia

It is a pleasure to be here with you. I hope we can make a few suggestions that may help you and your program. I have my staff with me today, and I want to introduce them. Neil Hopkins is our defensive coordinator. John Hopkins is our offensive and defensive end coach. Tommy Canterbury is our offensive and defensive backs coach. Jon Carpenter works with offensive ends, and Brian Massey is our quarterback coach.

We have been very fortunate at East Bank High School in that we have won four state AA championships in the last eight years. We are located in the Kanawha Valley, close to Charleston, West Virginia. We have about 450 students in the top three grades. East Bank may be better noted as the home of the famous basketball star Jerry West. Jerry is now general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers.

Before we start on our clinic topic, I would like to let you know that we know that there are other qualities that make you a winner. After our season is over, we sit down and have each player who is returning next year write down our team goals and his personal goals for the next football season. We feel this helps the players to understand their role on the team the next year. When we write down these goals, we always leave the "I" out. You do not find the letter "I" in team goals. When we talk with them as a group, we tell them how important it is to be better than they were last year. "You must be willing to put forth a lot of extra effort, and you must be coachable with discipline to win.'' Discipline is the key word. Discipline is important in our program if we want to have a chance to win. We feel the off-season is the best time to install discipline and create a feeling to treat everyone equally.

We believe in stressing the academics all year at East Bank High School. You cannot win if your players are in the stands and not on the field. I am sure most of you have heard the statement that athletes win games and coaches lose games. Let me tell you, if you are to win, then athletes must make the grade and be on that football field. It is your responsibility to get the players on the field. Our athletes are also recognized for their success in the classroom. We have a special page with the players' pictures in the football program for students who maintain a 3.0 or better GPA. They are also given special recognition at our assemblies. Our ultimate goal is someday to have a complete team picture on that 3.0 GPA page!

We also believe in our weight program. I am not an expert in the weight program, but I do know if you are bigger and stronger, you have a better chance to win. One has to understand that football is played from the chin up. If they have confidence in their strength, they are going to win for you. Athletes must have a good image of themselves and believe in what you are doing in your program. If you have any questions about our weight program, let me know after the lecture, and I will be glad to visit with you. We also weigh and measure our athletes at the start of the weight program. We weigh and compare them two times during the off-season to see if they are getting bigger and stronger. All of the athletes like to see their names on the weight charts, and they like to follow their progress. Again, recognition is a big part.

We have a few signs we like to stress. "UnityWinning is a weekly affair." We feel you must have a group effort. Painted on our locker room wall is this sign: "Bad boys of AA." Another sign we stress is this: "Pain is temporarypride is forever.'' We tell our players that we love them. We let them know that they mean a lot to our coaching staff.

Now, getting into the defensive game plan, we have what we call our nine commandments of defense. Let me cover them for you quickly. These points are based on our philosophy and our perception of the weaknesses and strengths of our personnel, and they are based on our players' ability to learn each week.

 





Page 90

Nine Commandments

1. Play your best players on defense. Defense is what wins championships. A good pitcher can shut down a good hitting team.

2. Gamble only for a purpose. This applies to gap control and reading defenses with man or zone coverages.

3. Defend the field. We may force the offense to go back to the short side of the field where we can use the boundary for help. We use man-to-man coverage a great deal of the time. This was especially true this past year because of the great speed we had in the secondary. We had three players who could run a 4.5, so we played a lot of man coverage.

4. Never get beat by our alignment. We try to keep our adjustments as simple as possible. We cover the types of blocks each player will see in the game and how we want them to defend against these blocks.

5. Go to automatic fronts on certain calls. Some offensive sets will predict what front we want to play. If you have better personnel, it will not make a lot of difference, but if you do not have better personnel, you may need to play certain fronts against some offensive sets.

6. Defend the obvious. We believe certain situations have a high probability for special type of plays. We must play the odds against these special plays.

7. Defend dangerous personnel. We like to take away the most dangerous threat while maintaining a general defense. Control is the key word. Never weaken your other areas in an effort to stop an outstanding player.

8. Defend what the offense does best. Tendencies are the key. Focus on what your opponents do best and their best players. By disrupting the offensive game plan, we can enhance our chances for success.

9. Keep the adjustments simple and easy. We must be able to adjust to unexpected formations. We simply call time out. We must be ready for shifts and motion. Big adjustments during a game are a gamble. You must make them for a definite reason. One key for us is to only use what we have had the opportunity to practice on and to perfect during practice.

As you know, you can only play with the players you have. This fact is very important in developing the defensive game plan.

Next, I want to get to our defensive front. I went to Marshall University and got a lot of help from Coach Tim Billings. want to cover the points Coach Billings went over with me.

1. The first thing to stress is position. It is important to stress stance and alignment.

2. You must learn to step to the gap. You need to learn to go from either hand.

3. The toe should be pointed straight ahead. Knees and feet should be straight. The shoulders should be pointed straight upfield and with a toe-to-heel relationship with the feet.

4. Foot back should be the foot to the shade man.

5. Start with two steps: Back foot first, right foot, step into man. Thumbs up, elbow straight, as if you are taking a picture.

6. Make a line six inches away. Don't step over the line. The foot replaces the hand. The hand comes with the foot. Hand above eyes, sit on heels, lift man up and out. Hips down, thumbs up, elbows in. Lead with the eyes and hands. Face into target, look for ball through gap, and feel pressure. Remember to have a comfortable stance, short step pick, a target area; punch press; slide and escape; don't turn your shoulders. Always teach hands first, feet second.

7. Three ways to control the gap are (a) my body, (b) his body (if he reaches me, knock him back), (c) my eyes (locate ball, pursuit drill).

 





Page 91

8. Hands go to target point; play side number. Hands above eyes; press and then slide; escape. Get off the block.

9. Target drill: Shuffle, right, left, step, hands, slide. Eyes are even or below the hands.

10. You may use the sled, but it is best body on body.

11. Use offensive lineman against defensive man. Don't use a snap count. Go on movement. You may have to go half-line if you do not have enough personnel.

12. Work against reach block: drive offensive man back; punch and press.

13. Work on press and squeeze: Get hands on them, punch-press, attack, then read. Don't turn shoulders. Anytime you get a down block, squeeze it. Don't get upfield; trap; use opposite arm.

14. On center fills to backside guard, punch center; drive him back; don't turn; keep shoulders square. If a person ever reaches you, get down the line of scrimmage.

15. On double team, step and punch; get shoulder down; turn to double team. Split double team.

16. In a 4 defense, you have to read the guard.

Now I want to get into the fronts. This is how we number our fronts. We line up in a 1 shade, 2 shade, or a 3 shade. We line up eye to eye on the offensive man. We number the offensive linemen from his right to his left. In a 1 shade, you are right eye to right eye. In a 3 shade, you are left eye to left eye.

We will always stunt from a 2 call unless it is a red call. The 
red
 means
that we will be in a certain type of defense for the offensive set that you are using.

The first number tells us our alignment as far as the type of defense. The next number is always for the line. The third number is for the secondary. If we end the call in a 1, it is man-to-man coverage. If we end the call in 2, we are going to play halves. If we end the call in 3, we are going to play zone coverage. We have tried to keep this simple for our defense. We do not number all of the offensive linemen with techniques as some people do on defense. We use the KISS principle. This is a 533 call. We can call 533, 532, or 531. We all play the 3 technique on the line.

This is a 523 call. All down linemen play the 2 alignment. We can call 523, 522, or 521.

This is our 513 call. All the down linemen play the 1 alignment. We can call 513, 512, or 511.

We call 523 slant right. Now all 3 down linemen line up in a 3 alignment and slant to our right.

The line should back off about six to eight inches to help on slants. We try to avoid contact from the offensive linemen. We want to break the line of scrimmage and find the ball. We try to rip the opposite arm under to the slant side.

We like to slant to the short side of formations. Anytime we are doing any stunting, we like to line up n a 2 technique. We do not want to get whipped. We want to make sure we have an equal chance to get to

 





Page 92

the inside or to the outside. We do number the gaps as most of you do: A, B, and C gaps.

One of our best calls has been our Y call. This is a loop technique for the tackle. The end is going to come down inside, and the tackle is going to take the quarterback.

We have some techniques where we always step with the foot that is to the shade side and follow with a short jab step with the trail foot. This is a six-inch punch step. With our hands under his pads, we roll the hips, thumbs up, head up, and tail down. This would be our 531 call.

We want to step to the offensive man, play gap control, and stay square with the line of scrimmage. You may use a three- or four-point stance. A three-point stance allows more movement laterally. A fourpoint is good against short yardage or pass rush. A four-point stance is good against teams that like to double-team a lot.

For a pass rush, change stance to sprinter stance. You are faster off the ball in a sprinter stance. We use the rip, hook-under, fake-and-go, and pull-and-tear techniques.

Against the trap, we must not get trapped. Anytime you do not feel pressure, we step down. Don't penetrate upfield. Wrong-arm trap if you can; if not, make a pile. Try to turn all traps into a sweep play. We want to make the other team run east and west, never north and south.

At times we call our red call, which is our auto-

alignment. We could call "red 1." This means we are going to go with a 2 technique to the formation side. We are going to shade the tight end and tackle in a 2 technique. We stack the linebacker.

We feel that we can protect the formation side to the strong side of the formation. We want to protect the linebacker by moving the down linemen. We can play a red 1, 2, or 3.

We can use a 40 front against multiple sets. This is our base alignment on our 40 base front. We still run the 40 front, and we still use the same type of calls.

We can use our calls from our 50 front while we are in our 40 defense. The call would be a 413. The 40 sets the defense. The 13 sets the rest of the defense. The 1 s the technique for the line, and 3 is our secondary coverage.

Against two tight ends we will go to our 60 alignment. We
may change some of our personnel, particularly

 





Page 93

inside over the guards, to help us inside. We may bring in our big people to help us inside on this defense. This would be our 63 look.

We can run our 523 alignment against two tight ends. We play our ends on the outside eye of the tight ends.

Also, we can play our 40 defense. This is how our 423

would look against two tight ends.

Here are our basic drills that we use to teach our techniques. We really stress these drills during the preseason. We do not run them as much in the regular season, but we do use them in warm-up. First is the shuffle drill. We go through the bags.

SHUFFLE

Next, we step over the bags. We do not cross over; we keep the shoulders square, the head up, and the tail down.

STEP OVER

The third drill is what we call fill and search. We shuffle and then step up and over, looking for the hole between the bags.

Next is the mirror or follow-the-man drill. One man tries to mirror the other as they go over the bags. We are working on footwork and agility on this drill.

Next we do a front-to-front or back-to-back find-the-man and form-tackle drill. We do not want anyone to get hurt in the drill. We have both men lie down on their backs and then have them get up on a signal. They get up and move down the line of bags.

Next is our work-up-the-field drill. We do not want them to cross over with the feet. We work upfield.

We do a lot of rope jumping during the off-season. This also helps us with our agility.

We use bags to teach our defensive linemen different techniques. We prefer to use man-on-man instead of

 





Page 94

the bags, but we do use the bags. We start out on our knees and work from that position, so we can go from a upright stance. We teach the punch, rip, swim, and underhook techniques. If we use a live man, we can get more out of the drill after we have the techniques down.

Neil Hopkins, Our Defensive Coordinator, Will Go Over Alignments and Stunts. Coach Neil Hopkins

It is a great honor to speak at one of the best coaching clinics in the United States. I have attended this clinic for the last several years and have always come away with something that helped me become a better coach. It has helped us become a better football team. We feel that if we do not attend clinics, we are hurting ourselves and our team.

We have been very successful at East Bank High School because we have good athletes and they believe in us and what we are trying to do. Hopefully, I will be able to give you one new idea that each of you can use in your program.

We use a multiple defensive scheme to try to balance out against the many offensive sets we see. We try to cause as much confusion to the offense as we can. As you know, you must defend the whole field as well as you can. You must try to balance your defense to take away as many weaknesses as you can.

We had always been a 50 defensive team until 1993. We went to a 40 scheme but still liked the 50 because it has always been very good to us. When we started looking at other schemes, we tried to come up with a sound system that would allow us to play both defenses, without a lot of confusion or personnel changes. We depend on our Will backer to be able to play down in our 50 scheme or up in our 40 scheme. We line him up at nose when he has to be able to play the run and also be able to defend the pass as a backer in our 40 scheme.

We are a gap-control defense in both the 40 and 50 schemes. We try to attack the offense and force them into situations they do not like to be in. We feel that if you have the ball, you have stolen the royal jewels, and we want it back. We want every offense that we face to feel like a virgin in a house of ill repute. They know they are going to get it, but they do not know when or how bad.

I want to go over how we call our defenses and change our alignments. Coach Hensley talked about our alignment for our down linemen and how they move and stunt with our calls. I will cover the base 40 and some alignments and stunts that we use.

We play three basic coverages in our secondary. Our 1 call is man to man. The 2 call is two deep. The 3 call is our three-deep zone.

Our Mike, Will, and Sam backers get their alignment by our line call. If we are in a 40, the call will be 413, 423, or 433. The first number is what defense we will be in: 4 means 40. The second number sets our linemen: 1 shade, 2 head-up, 3 shade. The last number-1, 2, or 3-tells our secondary what they are playing. Here are some examples.

CALL 413

CALL 433

CALL 423

CALL 513

CALL 533

CALL 523

We can change our secondary calls at any time. We may show three-deep and adjust into a man or a two-deep call.

Now I will show you a few of our best stunts from the alignments I have covered. Everyone here knows that when you stunt, you take a chance. We try to cover ourselves every way possible. We stunt for two basic reasons. We are trying to make something positive happen, or we cannot match up and we are trying to give ourselves a chance to win.

Our red-hot call in both the 40 and 50 schemes is an all-out blitz where we are bringing at least seven people. First is our 40red hot1.

Philosophy and Organization

Campbell High School, Hawaii

I have a lot of notes that I will be referring to today. It is an honor to be here. I want to thank Rick Sakata for giving me the opportunity to speak. When I was asked to speak, I was apprehensive about speaking before such a large group. My wife told me to suck it up and to quit complaining. She said, "It will be a piece of cake." Some of you know my wife. She can talk. She has a bachelor's degree from Harvard and a master's from Yale. She is getting a doctorate from the University of Hawaii. Next month she will be speaking before 500 physicians at the National Cancer Institute in Washington, D.C. This is her topic: "The Role of Gap-Junctional Communication on Human Papilloma Virus-Induced Cervical Dysplasia." Wow! It makes my topic seem a little lame by comparison. Here we go.

In 19941 became coach at Campbell High School, which is my alma mater. I played football for Campbell High. Many of you know about our poor record when I was a player. We did not win one game. We were terrible. Our futility on the gridiron is well documented. We have been playing football since 1964. From 1964 to 1993 we only had four winning seasons. We had never won a play-off game.

People ask me how we turned the program around since 1994. We have had three winning seasons in a row. In 1994 we went 7-3, in 1995 we were 7-3, and in 1996 we were 9-3. The big question I get is why we have to lose three games each year. I do not know. A lot of it has to do with our schedule and our big rival Waianae High School.

To change the program, there were several things we had to do. The first thing we had to do was to set a vigorous weight-training program. We did this by making it mandatory for all football players to enroll in a seventh period weight-training class for credit. They come to class at 2:20 P.M., and they lift until 3:30.

The second thing we did was to demand discipline through changes in their behavior both on the field and off the field. To change any program quickly, you must have a foundation and a philosophy that you believe in. It must be a philosophy that will serve and guide you throughout your coaching career.

There are three elements of the Campbell High School program: philosophy, off-field activities, and on-field activities. I will hit practice organization later, but first I want to talk about our philosophy.

First, treat kids fairly. By this we mean what 
we 
think is fair. It could be unfair to someone else. Be honest and consistent. We deal straight up and tell it like it is. Kids can tell if you do not tell the truth.

Second, we must coach with enthusiasm. If you are not excited, don't expect the players to be. Is football fun? Winning is fun. If you are losing, it is not fun; however, you cannot guarantee winning. It is no fun if you are in a fight and someone is beating the crap out of you.

Third, we want to play the best 11. That means both ways if needed. You want to get the kids to a position where they have a chance to win. As coaches, we must do our utmost to prepare them for the chance to win. We tell our players to play hard. We do not buy the excuse that they are tired. This is not basketball or some other sport where you can raise your hand and come out of the game. We do not care how tired you are; you are going to play. You are going to do it for the team. We have found that no football player has ever missed a school dance or a chance to party after the game. After the game they find a lot of energy. If they can play two ways, they do.

This is our philosophy:

1. We want to physically dominate our opponent. We want to do it quickly. We go for it in the first quarter. We want to plant the seed of doubt in them that we are better and more physical than they are.

 





Page 98

2. We want to outcondition our opponents. We try to beat teams in the second half or fourth quarter. We always want to be in better condition than the other team. It is not only physical condition, it is mental condition. We define mental toughness as the ability to maintain physical toughness for a long period of time. If you are only physical for one quarter, you will not win. If you are physical for four quarters, then you are mentally tough.

3. We want to generate emotion. These are kids. Get them to love each other. Sell them on being a family. We tell them to back their football family.

4. We expect total commitment from everyone associated with the program. We do not want people on the side talking crap about us. If someone has a problem, they need to come and talk to us.

We do not tolerate any excuses from anyone. We tell the kids not to listen to parents, friends, or others that don't know crap about football. We run the team. Listen only to the coaches.

At Campbell High School we develop athletes three ways:

1. Academically. We preach self-discipline, responsibility, self-motivation, and accountability. We tell kids to do the right things. They must go to class, make good grades, etc. However, we are not going to hold their hands to class. We provide guidance and study halls and any help they need, but they have to ask for it. We cannot bail them out for the rest of their life. We do not treat them any differently from the rest of the student body.

2. Socially. We stress being a good person. Be polite and respectful of others. Respect your family and teachers. Don't cheat or lie or do anything to embarrass the school, your family, the coaches, or your teammates. Pride is doing the right thing when nobody is watching.

3. Athletically. We stress being the best you can be. Not everyone has natural talent, but if you work hard and build upon what you have, you will be successful. A strong work ethic will carry over into other areas of life. Go all out, or get the hell out! The three stripes of a Campbell Saber are pride, poise, and courage.

You need money to buy a lot of different things for the football team. There are a lot of hidden costs involved with a football team. Our A.D. buys us jerseys and other equipment, but we still have to raise money. At Campbell we have a booster organization called the Sabers Football Club. The head coach has to be ultimately responsible for everything. The buck stops with you. You can have booster members, including parents, friends, or wives, but you do not turn over the program and let the parents run things. They will turn it into a monster. Make it clear that the are working under the head coach. There are a lot of areas in which booster clubs can help. This is how they help us.

1. Football banquet 

2. Spring football game 

3. Souvenir and T-shirt sale 

4. Kickoff night 

5. Newsletters 

6. Homecoming 

7. Passing league 

8. Helmet awards 

9. Highlight video 

10. Power-lifting meet 

11. Finances 

12. Fund-raising

The spring game has been dropped because of the High School Athletic Association. We used to make $2000 just from the spring game. We are thinking about having a passing league spring game. We may just ask them to donate a dollar at the game.

We have the kickoff night just before we start the three-a-day practices. We invite all of the parents, and we feed them. We show the highlight video from the year before. We talk about all of the forms they have to fill out. We try to get them pumped up by talking

 





Page 99

about the upcoming season. We try to get them excited. I bring out the equipment and tell them how much it cost.

We send them two newsletters, one in the summer before practice starts and one at the end of the season. In the first letter we tell them what they need to do to get ready for the season. I tell them about camp and what we have planned for the year.

Let me talk about practice organization. Many of you have asked me about our practice schedule that coordinates both the JV and varsity together into one practice.

1. JV and varsity practice together. They do the same drills and use the same terminology, same plays, and the same coaching staff for the last four years.

2. The JVs exist for the sole purpose of developing players for the varsity. If a player develops rapidly while on the JVs, he may be called up anytime during the season or postseason. We are not trying to win the JV championship. That is not our goal, but if we do, it is a bonus.

3. Our practice is split up. We designate one side of the field as offensive and the other side as the defensive side.

4. Everything in practice has to be a progression. Everything should logically build on the preceding principle or concept that you were teaching before. At Campbell, we feel that practice is one of the most important aspects of our program.

5. Our practices come down to these four principles:

a. Organization. Based on scouting information, every adjustment and contingency imaginable will be covered. Every minute of practice will be used wisely. All coaches are responsible for completing the teaching within the required time. If it is a 10-minute period, then it is the coach's responsibility to teach the material in that time frame. Be overprepared. Team morale is achieved when your players truly feel they are prepared.

b. Performance. Simulate playing conditions. Don't do nonsense drills that just take up time. Be sure that they have a specific purpose and that each player is given the chance to perform his fundamentals, techniques, and assignments as a football player. Be sure the things that are important to you in August are still important to you in November. Always stress fundamentals and techniques.

c. Precision. Again, everything that we will be doing in the game will be practiced precisely. If we want to add three plays on a given day and we are incapable of doing it precisely, then we practice just the one or two plays that we were able to get in, and we will do those precisely. When we beat Kailua with 19 seconds remaining on homecoming, it was not a desperation pass from Kaleopa to Acidera that won it, but it was a play that had been rehearsed and practiced time and time again. Everyone knew exactly where they had to be. If you are not performing your plays precisely during practice, then you will not perform them precisely during the game.

d. Evaluation. If you do not evaluate and constantly upgrade your practices, you will never know what your problems are or how to fix them. Analyze and rate your practices. Film them if possible. Coaches need to give input about what they feel is working and not working. Every coach needs to know exactly what his role is and what he has to do next. Coaches should meet every day after practice to go over what has happened at practice. Are we doing too much of this? Not enough of that? Are we too negative? Are we too soft? What can we do better? This process may be the most important aspect of practice.

6. To us, enthusiasm is a prerequisite. Our coaches are very vocal, but not in the negative sense. They are constantly encouraging the players and are on top of things. We will not tolerate anything less than the players' best efforts and are always ready to encourage or pick them up with encouraging words.

 





Page 100

7. One final note about how you approach an opponent on the week of practice and the game. Be careful when prejudging an opponent. When Lou Holtz talked about an opponent prior to the game, he would pump them up and make them greater than they actually were. You have to be careful with high school kids when you do that. While we never want to underestimate an opponent, it can be equally wrong to overestimate them. By doing so, we concede certain things that they have not earned. We tell them we are going to prepare for the game.

We tell them that we must believe that we are going to win the game. It is not how badly you are going to win, but we are confident, we have prepared, and we have tried our best in practice. We are united as a team, we came here to win, and that is what we want to do. If you lose, you know that you tried your best. When you leave, you never hang your head.

Let me cover our coaches organization and how we divide the responsibilities in our program.

Here is our three-a-day practice schedule. We do not give them time to do crap. It is a warrior mentality. If you come to our three-a-days, it means you have given up the summer and the good times to work on football. We do not have sleep-overs. We do not have the facilities to stay overnight. They have to get there early. This is how our day goes.

THREE-A-DAY PRACTICE SCHEDULE

7:30-8:00-Breakfast/clean-up

8:00-8:30-Prepractice: Bring out cones, bags, balls, etc.

8:30-11:30-Practice no. 1

11:30-12:00-Change/get ready for lunch

12:00-1:00-Lunch/clean-up

1:00-1:30-Free time (coaches meet)

1:30-2:15-Practice no. 2: Offense lift; defense on field

2:15-3:00-Practice no. 2: Defense lift; offense on field

3:00-3:20-Free time (coaches meet)

3:20-3:30-Prepractice: Bring out cones, bags, balls, etc.

3:30-6:30-Practice no. 3

When our guys go home, they are dead tired. They go home and go to bed. They know they have to be back early. That is a typical three-a-day practice schedule.

 





Page 101

Let me set the football schedule after school starts. I will talk about individual activities as we go through the schedule. Our first period is the seventh period at 2:30 P.M. when we have study hall or lift weights. That is where we have our lectures and films and weights. Then at 3:15 we tape and get dressed. Each schedule is set up like this.

DATE
DRESS 
OPPONENT
TIME
VARSITY
ACTIVITY          JV

As you can see, we have the varsity listed on the left side and the JVs on the right side. The next session is the special period. We have all of the punters, snappers, kickers, and return men. They report 15 minutes before practice starts. We have 30 minutes for our special period. A lot of people think that is a long time. It is important to us. We do not just give it lip service. It is important to us, so we work on it. We also use this period as an individual time for the non-kicking people.

Next is our Saber period. That session is for 15 minutes. Then we have our block A session for 20 minutes. We have three sessions on the A block. Then we switch blocks and work the same amount of time on block B. Next we have 15 minutes of conditioning, and it is pure hell. Then we finish with our postpractice. We also open the weight room for those who want to lift. Then the coaches have our meeting.

At the bottom of our practice schedule, we have several items that are helpful to our staff. We list the players that might be ineligible, injuries, players who did not dress that day or were absent or tardy, and other comments. Then we have opportunities listed. That is our punishment list, but we call it an opportunity list.

On the next sheet we have each activity listed in the practice. For example, we have everything listed that we plan to cover in our special teams session. Everyone is involved. Special team players are on one side of the field, and all others on the other side. They are working on individual work while the special team does their thing.

We do not do all of the kicking game in one day. We try to punt every day, at least one or two. We work on normal punts, pressure punts, kicking the ball into the end zone, and all other situations that we need to work on. We work on some phase of the kicking game every day, four days per week.

Our Saber period is this. It is my favorite period. I carry a horn in my pocket. I do not use a whistle. When I blow the horn, they know it is time for the next period. The Saber period is a walk-and-talk session with the entire offense on one side of the field and the defense on the other side. We use this on Saturday mornings and on Mondays. We go over mistakes and other things we are working on. It is a walk-and-talk session.

Next, we go to form tackling and block stations. We all talk about the game being a game of fundamentals, or blocking and tackling. We practice it every single day. We do blocking and tackling stations. We have forced them to do it. It may be hitting a sled or driving the sled, but we are going to do it.

The question is asked, How do we incorporate a player who plays both offense and defense?

In the block A period, we have the varsity working on offense and the JVs working on defense on the other side of the field. All of the varsity players are on the offensive field-all of them. The defensive starters are playing the scout team. We do not practice against a bunch of scrubs. We are running against our first defense. They are the scout team. They are getting some things done, but it may not be the exact things they would be doing on our defense. We will change it up and alternate players in and out.

We run nine-on-seven drills. Some of you may call it skeleton drills or combo drills. Only the first and second teams get reps, with 70 percent of the reps going to the first team and 30 percent to the second team. Everyone else must play on the scout team. We work our first receivers against our first DBs. The second-team quarterback will throw to his receivers against air.

 





Page 102

We have 20 to 25 plays written down on a script sheet. It is a nine-on-seven drill script sheet, and we run our plays in sequence. We list 20 to 25 plays to work on that day. We may not get all of them off. Each coach has the list of plays we are working on. On our sevenon-seven drill, we do the same.

TEAM OFFENSIVE SCRIPT

Team                             Date

No. Hash/Down & Distance

Formation/Play/Offense

1. Across the page

2. Down the page to 25

During this period the 0 line and D line will be working on run blocking for the first 10 minutes. For the second 10 minutes they do pass blocking. It is a drill for the offense. This is where the defensive coach works on new things with his players. Everything is offense in this period.

Then we go to period 3. This is our team period. Now we work against the defense that we expect to see. We do everything by situations. We have the areas of the field covered. We work on being backed up, in the danger zone, and on the one-yard line. We have to be prepared to come out of our end zone.

We practice as if we are going in to score, and when we are in the red zone, we work on short yardage, say, 3rd and 2. We work on ball control and controlling the clock. We practice motion and any special play. Also, we work on our two-minute offense.

We have a team offense script. All of our offensive coaches have this list. We work on all of the situations. We list the number of the play, the hash, down and distance, formation, play, and against what defense. We list special situations and goal-line plays. We work against all situations that we feel we need to cover for the game that week. We try to get them all into that time frame of 20 minutes.

Now we honk the horn and go to block B. Now all of the JV players will come together and run the offense. All of the varsity will play offense against the JVs. If you have a player who wants to play both ways and he has been working on offense, now he can go and work with the defense. He will get the same amount of time. If he is a first-team offensive player, instead of playing scout team during the first defensive emphasis, he is with the defense working on plays.

We switch after 20 minutes and work JVs on defense and the varsity on offense. We do the drill all over again. The coaches never leave. They work all of the JVs, and they coach all of the varsity. They stay on one side of the field, and the players switch.

Next we go to seven-on-seven again, but now we are working on defense. We work one-on-one and go over our coverages.

The last part of the defense sessions is our team defense. This is where we work on our stunts and variations. Again, we have the plays scripted that we want our defense to work on that particular day.

The conditioning drills are individual. We break up with individual coaches by positions. Each group works on conditioning.

Next, we have a postpractice session. An opportunity is not a good thing for our players. If they are one second late, they get one opportunity. If they are more than 15 minutes late, they get two opportunities. At the conclusion of practice, we line everyone up on the sideline. We call the roll of opportunity victims. They come out and go on the goal line. The team is on the sideline, and they are not going to say a word. It is punishment with the whole team watching. Everyone knows they must pay the price equally, no matter who they are. The team will encourage them during the punishment. One opportunity consists of a 200-yard sprint followed by a 200-yard jog and drop, followed by a 200-yard bear crawl, followed by a 200-yard roll. That is 
one 
opportunity. After one, they never want to do one again. They make a real effort to be on time.

If you want, I will send you a copy of our practice schedule. Drop me a line. Thanks. Again, I want to thank Rick Sakata.

Defensive End Techniques

University of Louisville

It is a pleasure to be here. I feel fortunate to be at a school such as the University of Louisville. It is an honor to coach for Ron Cooper. Ron is a good coach and a good person. I think he has a tremendous staff and support system. We have a training room that is great. I can't say enough about the job Ray Ganong does with our players in the weight program. I think we had a good season last year, and a lot of credit goes to what they were doing in the weight room with our players. If you get a chance to stop by our weight room, make sure you visit with Ray Ganong and his staff. They really do a good job with our off-season program.

First, I want to go over our defensive staff with you. Our defensive coordinator is Everett Withers, and he coaches the secondary. Rock Roggeman coaches the defensive tackles. Sal Sunseri coaches the linebackers. I coach the defensive ends. Together we have all been able to put our thoughts and ideas into the defense. We all bring something different to the table. I think that has helped us overall as a defense.

I have a few stats on how our defense did this past season. The Cardinal defense has been ranked among the top 25 nationally in scoring defense in each of the past two seasons, including a number seven finish in 1995. In the last 22 games, the defense has allowed an average of 16.8 points per game. This past season, our defense held opponents to an average of 235.8 yards per game, good for fifth among NCAA Division I teams. Actually, after the bowl games we were fourth. First in defense was Florida State, then North Carolina, Virginia, and then Louisville.

We held opponents to 96.7 yards per game in passefficiency defense to finish 13th overall on defense. We do stress stopping the run at Louisville. We talk each day about how to stop the run. We stress this to our kids, and we have been successful in doing that. We allowed opponents an average of 81.1 yards per game on the ground to finish fourth nationally. Senior Sam Madison, our defensive back, received first team All-American honors. He has a great chance to be drafted as a number one pick in the NFL. He had six interceptions in 1996. Another defensive leader for us was linebacker Tyrus McCloud. He had 144 tackles in 1996, and he too has a great shot at the NFL.

Our defense had a school-record 45 sacks in 1996. Senior defensive end Carl Powell had 11. Seven of the sacks came in a two-week period against Memphis and North Carolina. I will talk about some of the defensive techniques he used to get those sacks.

Next I want to share with you our defensive goals for the year. What do you want to do to be successful? We keep the goals on a chart and keep them updated after each game. This is what we wanted to achieve in 1996.

1996 Defensive Team Goals

Each of these headings is listed at the top of the chart. What we feel we need to do to win is listed under the heading. We have our schedule down the side of the chart, and we fill the columns in as the season progresses.

You can see the areas where we did well and the areas where we did not do well. We use these goals to set up our defense for the season. We stress to our defense that we must get to the football. We ask them this question. What must we do to win? This is what we came up with.

How we will win on defense? Do not allow a long pass completion for a touchdown. Do not allow a long run for a touchdown. Intercept passes and return them for yardage and touchdowns. Force the opponent to fumble.

We stress the fact we must play great goal-line defense. We feel that if we can do that, we have a chance to win. We stress fundamentals on defense. This is what we stress with our players: Shoulders square; proper arm free; pads over our toes; keep a base; don't run around blocker; do not give them anything but pads, bones, and elbows; stay on your feet.

We start with our general techniques. We start every thing from a base. This is what we stress: stance, alignment, key ball to man, responsibility.

This past year we played three different defensive fronts. The first defense we teach is what we call our load 53 defense. We have a tackle call to the tightend side. The tackle and end to the tight end are going to line up in a 3 technique and a 7 technique. On the split-end side we have a tackle in a shade technique and the end in a 5 technique. Our Sam linebacker goes to the tight-end side. The Mike linebacker is on the outside shoulder of the center. The Will linebacker is stacked inside the offensive tackle and behind our 5technique end. As you can see, we are based out of the 4-3 alignment. That is our base defense. We do a lot of other things out of this defense.

LOAD 53

The next defense we look at is the over 53 look. Our call-side end is in a 9 technique, and the backside end is in a 5 technique.

OVER 53

Between the load and over calls, only two players changed their techniques. The only two people to change are the call-side end and the Sam linebacker. The end steps out to a 9 technique, and the Sam linebacker steps inside. If we call 
load, 
the call-side end knows he is in the 7 technique. If we call 
over, 
the end is in a 9 technique.

We are a one-gap defense up front. The tackles are going to work together. The tackles know that if we are in load, the offside tackle is responsible for the B gap and the backside tackle is responsible for the A

 





Page 105

gap. The ends know that if we call load, the call-side end is responsible for the C gap. He is a C-gap player.

Our linebackers are responsible for two gaps. They have a primary gap and a secondary gap. In our load, the Mike linebacker is an A-gap player. The Sam linebacker is a D-gap player, and the Will linebacker is a B-gap player. We are a four-spoke secondary. We have two safeties and two corners. We will always give you that look. If we go to our over 53, the look will stay the same for our secondary. What we are doing is nothing hard. We try to keep everything simple. Those are the two fronts we ran against pro action. If the offense came out in two backs, one tight end, and two receivers, we call that look 
regular personnel 
When we see that set, that is what you are going to get from our defensive front. If you come out in what we call H formation, which is two tight ends with one back and two wide receivers, we get into more of a base look.

When we call load G, this tells the backside tackle he is going to move from a shade to a 2 technique. Our backside end is in a 5 technique. This is good against the bootleg reverse. I will cover that later.

On the isolation play, the offside tackle is going to get a drive block. The first block that the end has to learn to defeat is the drive block. He has to step up and knock the tackle upfield. He keeps his outside leg and arm free and forces the ball inside.

5 TECHNIQUE VS. DRIVE BLOCK

The fullback is going to lead on the Will linebacker. He steps up and takes on the fullback with his inside arm and leg. He forces the ball back inside for the Mike linebacker. The Mike linebacker is playing two gaps. He is responsible for the strong-side A gap, and he is also responsible for the backside B gap on flow away. I want to talk about two drills that I do that help the ends take care of the men in front of them. [Demo] The first drill I will talk about is our explosion drill. We have to be able to attack that man in front of us. He needs to know what to do if that offensive tackle knocks him off the ball. He has to be able to step back and strike again.

We start off in a two-point stance with a slight bend in our ankles, knees, and hips. The head is up. As the man steps toward me, all I want to do is explode and put my face mask inside with my head up and get my hands inside on the breast plate. If you have a two-man sled, you can use it to work on the drill. If you do not have a sled, take a player and have him hold a hand dummy. Teach him to explode into the dummy. Teach him to strike a blow in a good football position. We call this pads-out drill.

We want to teach them to come up with the ankles, knees, and hips and explode into the man and push him off of me. We want to teach him to play with pads up. He has to learn to step up and hit the blocker and knock him back off the ball. All you need is three or four reps a day working on pads-out. It is best to start the drill with a stationary machine. He does not need to move his feet. You are looking for explosion and the power move.

We teach the drill a little differently than most people. Most people start from a three-point stance. We start out teaching this technique from a two-point stance. Once he learns to hit the sled and to explode and get his knees and hips into the drill, we teach him to step up and strike from a three-point stance. We call this our pads-out drill.

We have a defensive checklist. There are a lot of things to teach the defensive ends. We do not make this list very difficult. This is very simple. It is a good thing for me to review. Each day I go over certain drills. I do not do everything on the checklist. We do some of these drills every day. We talk about these drills from the two-, three-, four-, and six-point stance.

Next, I want to talk about the skate drill. In this drill we do basically three things. I will demonstrate these

 





Page 106

three things. [Demo: lock out and separate, lock out and rip, and lock out and beat the reach block]

I start the defensive end in a good football position. His hands should be on the outside to start out. We always talk about hand and eye placement. We want the hands inside on the breast plate. His palm is up, and we are in the V of the neck. If we have inside gap, we only work on one thing. We pull with the inside arm and lock out with the outside arm. We just turn the shoulders.

After that, we need to go upfield with the man. We pull on the outside and lock out. As we do that, we are putting a step into the move. It is a quick step. We are trying to get the players to understand leverage on the blocking. After doing some research, I found out that our kids need to know and understand pressure points and leverage to play good football. [Demo]

The next phase of the drill is lock out and rip. We do the same as before, but now we rip and come upfield three yards. We want to keep the shoulders square. We run the drill so each player gets one or two shots on it.

The next drill is against the reach block. Now we want him to lock and reach. He is in a good football position, and he is inside. The offensive man has already reached the defensive man. The football is going to the outside. Now we want to pull the man back inside. We want to use his weight and leverage. We want to throw him back inside and get off the block. If you are playing the 5 technique, you do not know where the offensive man is going. You must react to what he is doing.

5 TECHNIQUE VS. REACH BLOCK

Let me go back to the basic drive block again. As the offensive man comes at our end, he is in a three-point stance. My inside foot is going to be on his outside foot. I have to step up on him. We hit him in the V of the neck, keep the hands inside, and drive him back upfield. If you get movement and knock him back upfield, then the offense does not have a chance. You are forcing the ball inside. We do not want them going inside too quickly. We know that tailback can squirt back outside. We know all linebackers are going to scrape to the ball.

On the toss sweep, the 5-technique end must make his first step upfield. He has to know how to react against that blocker. That blocker is trying to get to his outside number. We want to string the play out wide. We do not want the ball going north and south. We have the safety who is going to fill inside. Also, we have a Will linebacker who is going to fill. We want our end to get outside and make the play.

The next block we are going to see against our 5 technique is the down block. This is the block we see on the inside zone play. I want the end to step upfield with that first step. He sets his feet with the second step. This gets him going. He wants to keep his shoulders square. The offensive tackle blocks down inside. I tell our ends to choke down and to find out what is going on. I want him to drag that back leg two steps. If the ball is inside, the end reads the mesh point for that quarterback. His eyes should be on that quarterback. The quarterback is going to give the ball to the fullback, or he is going to keep the ball on the bootleg, or it is going to be a reverse play. Most teams like to run the zone play and cut back into the C gap. We want to take that away from the man with the ball. As the blocker steps down, we want to step up. We want to punch the tackle inside. Now we are going to drag our feet and keep our shoulders square to the line of scrimmage. They can see everything from this position. I tell them to train their eyes to keep the shoulders square. The first thing he should expect is the fullback on the inside zone play.

5 TECHNIQUE VS. DOWN BLOCK

 





Page 107

The first person we tell the end to look for is the pulling lineman coming down the line. If the offensive lineman is off the line, it will probably be some kind of bootleg or waggle play. If he sees that, he heads upfield to try to contain the quarterback. If the man is pulling down the line, we want our end to occupy the hole and squeeze the play down. We want to attack the inside shoulder of the blocker and push him back upfield. This will allow our Will linebacker to scrape over the top and make the stop. If our defensive end does not get under the pulling guard, we have trouble.

DOWN BLOCK/KICK-OUT/COUNTER

That allows the tackle to get down on the Mike linebacker. They have a chance to get the play away. Will is going to scrape off outside. The Mike linebacker is filling inside and plays the football.

The next play that the 5 technique looks for is the bootleg reverse. If the fullback does not have the ball, he looks for the reverse. We ask our end to keep his shoulders square to the goalpost. We want him to make a straight line and get up the field. We do not want him to try to get outside. We want him to go straight upfield. We want to make the football bounce wide. We want to make the football bounce deeper and wider. Hopefully, we will have some help, and they will make the play. We want to make the ball bounce deep and wide and let our pursuit catch the ball. If we can do that, we will be in good shape.

Those are the reads we do every day in practice for the 5 technique. This is the bread and butter of playing defensive end. We do not switch our ends. We keep them on the same side. We play the techniques the same.

5 TECHNIQUEBOOTLEG REVERSE

The next thing I want to talk about is our 7 technique. I feel that we play the 7 technique pretty well. Again, the inside hand is down, and the outside foot is back. He lines up on the inside neck of the tight end. Everything we talk about starts with that first step. The tight end comes off to drive-block the 7 technique. We do the same things that we did against the offensive tackle when we were in the 5 technique. We want to step up and use our hands to get inside the V of his neck and drive him back up the field. We do key inside. Some teams key the offensive tackle. We feel that the tight end will tell us what is going on. There are only three or four things he can do. He can reach inside to try to cut us off, he can drive-block us, he can release outside on a pass route, and he can sit back and block for some type of play like the draw. If our end can understand the progression and know what is coming off, he will be in good shape.

Again, it is the same as the 5 technique against the tackle on the drive block. We want to step up, punch, get our hands inside, and lock the tight end out. We want to find out what is going on with the ball. If the football is inside, we want to close off the C gap. He is a C-gap player.

7 TECHNIQUE VS. COUNTER

 





Page 108

Let's go on to the zone play. The next big read he is going to get is the counter off tackle. This was a big read for us this year. The tight end would step up and get our end into a drive block. He would punch to the inside. As he was doing that, the offensive tackle was taking a zone step to get outside of our end so he could reach him. That is a tough block for the tackle, especially if the end is a player. We want our end to explode and make a straight line up the field. We want to attack the end as he releases. We do not want him to release to get to our Sam linebacker. We try to hold him up from going inside. If we can do that, it will take the tackle and end to block our end. Our Sam linebacker can make the play on a scrape to the outside. Also, our Mike linebacker is scraping to that side. The zone play may go five yards outside. If we can make the play go back inside, we are happy. If the play stretches outside, the C gap also stretches. The same is true for the B and A gaps as they stretch. Everyone has to get into their gaps and stretch the play. As the play cuts back, the pursuit will make the play.

7 TECHNIQUE VS. OUTSIDE ZONE

The next thing I want to talk about is playing the draw and screen plays. Every day we talk to our ends about these plays. If that offensive tackle gives our end a high hat and the tackle tries to punch him upfield and opens his hips, he knows something is wrong. We need to learn how to play the draw. As the end comes off the ball, most tackles are going to hunch back and try to knock the end upfield. I tell the end that he has to stop in his tracks. If he sees the tackle and sees the draw, he has to retrace his steps and come back down inside and make the play. If our end does get upfield and then he sees the draw, we want him to retrace his steps straight back down the field. If he can do that, he probably will make the tackle at the line of scrimmage, or the play may bounce outside. Next, I want to talk about what I call all of the unusual plays that the defensive end is going to see from a 7 technique. This is something you have to put into your practices and work on. We work on the screen with our 5 and 7 technique. If the tackle tries to chop us as we get upfield and the quarterback continues to give ground, then something is going on. The end has to develop some instincts. If he feels that the screen is developing, he must get downfield. We want to plant and move our eyes to the outside. We are looking for a receiver coming back down inside. He may be able to break the play up if he can get there in time, or he may be able to make the tackle as soon as the receiver catches the ball.

We work on the draw and screen every day. We take a football and have them in their positions. We simulate the quarterback on a drop. If the quarterback drops the ball down, we have them step and plant the inside foot and open back to the inside. He retraces his steps, looking back inside. We want him in position to make the play. If the quarterback drops deeper, the defender should know it is a screen. One of the first plays we are going to check for is the screen. If the outside screen is not there, we look for the middle screen. We work this drill every day. In the course of the game, when they run the screens, you have to be able to react to them. Because we have covered what to do, we feel we have a chance to be successful.

Next, I want to talk about the pass rush. The thing we want to do is to key the football and movement. We are in a three-point stance. When we are in the pass rush mode, we want to close our base stance. We use more of a sprinter's stance. We tell him to get into the most comfortable stance. We want him to be able to rush upfield. We want him to be able to rush the quarterback. We want our rush people to know the down and distance on each play. We want them to attack half the man as they get upfield. We always want to have a game play. I tell our players that we have a first move and then we have a countermove. I am going to go over three types of pass rush. I want to cover the rip, swim, and spin techniques.

The first technique I will cover is the speed rush. It is 3rd and 10, and we have to get to the quarterback. I

 





Page 109

want the end out wide in a sprinter's stance. I ask our end to get to three yards right behind the offensive tackle. We can run by the tackle for that four-yard stretch. We can beat the tackle to that point. If we can beat them on the speed rush, we can get to the quarterback. That is the speed rush. Use your speed to beat the blocker.

Next, we talk about attacking one half of the man. If the tackle gets to the spot and we get tied up with him, we want to be able to beat him. Once the blocker gets his shoulders turned, you have something you can work with. We work on the outside half of the man. What I am talking about is basically a rip move. [Demo] We step with the outside foot, rip with the inside arm, step through the man, and go get the quarterback.

The next move we talk about is the swim move. Now, I bring the arm up and bring the elbow up inside. This will clear you, and you can get to the quarterback. [Demo]

We have the tackle so concerned because we have beaten him to the outside. Next, we want to get to the bull-rush move. We get our face mask into the man and drive him back into the quarterback. The feet never stop moving. I want them to perfect their moves and be able to use their best move in a game.

The next move is the spin move. As we make contact, we want to take the inside foot and step up and then spin. As we spin, we want to make sure that we are by the man. If you don't, he can step back inside and pick you up. The spin move and countermoves have been good for us.

I will go over three pass-rush stunts with you. We do not do a lot of different stunts on the pass rush. First is what we call the Texas stunt. The tackles penetrate first, stepping inside and then slanting outside into the face of the offensive man. The ends are going to come down inside. They come off the inside hip of the tackles. This should free him up to the quarterback.

PASS RUSHTEXAS

On the Ex stunt the ends go first, and the tackles come outside off the hips of the ends.

PASS RUSHEX

The stunt that was very effective for us was what we called Taco. We have a Texas on the call side, and we have an Ex on the split side. This is good against man protection. We have an end in the A gap and one in the B gap.

PASS RUSHTACO

That is all of our pass-rush stunts. Most of our sacks came off the base rush. I want to put on our game film so you can see what I have talked about. Thanks.

Zone Blocking Against Stunting Defenses

Hope College

I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this morning and for your coming to hear me speak. I am honored to be here. I have been very fortunate as a person and especially as a coach. I've had great support from my family my entire life. I am the seventh of eight children, and one of my brothers is here with us today. Steve is a high school coach down in Illinois. That is where the real coaching takes place. I love my job, but I admire and respect all of the high school coaches. I was hired at Hope College when I was only 24 years old. I became the head coach when I was 32. What I want to do now is tell you a little about what we are doing with our zone running game. I believe we have started having success again because we are able to teach our kids how to block in this system. I believe that I can teach our kids how to block the man across from them. It's an attitude, and I have to instill that in our linemen. I truly believe that the offensive line has to lead the team. They have to set the tempo and set morale. When things go badly, everyone looks to the offensive line to get it going again.

When I became the head coach two years ago, I felt there were two things that had to happen right away. One, we had to install a legitimate off-season program. We started four sections of a conditioning and weight-training class that our kids can take for credit. I really felt I had to be the key player in the offseason program if it was going to work, so I teach three of the four sections myself. We concentrate on quickness and change of direction before we ever step foot in the weight room. I would be glad to talk to any of you later about our off-season program, because we really like what we are doing and it works.

The second thing I changed right away was our offensive line coach. George Kraft had coached the offensive line at Hope for 28 years and had done a great job. I had no qualms with his coaching, but I felt it was imperative that I take over the offensive line myself. Again, it goes back to the attitude that I wanted our players to have. As far as I'm concerned, a team's attitude starts with the offensive line. Who better than the head coach to instill the attitude I wanted with the most important position on the field? I would like to say that I have learned and picked things up over the years from a number of people, and what I know is a compilation of their coaching. I've spent time with Tony Wise from the Chicago Bears, Mike DeBord at Michigan, Joe Moore at Notre Dame, Mike Jacobs from Ohio State, Mike Barry from Southern Cal, and George Kraft from Hope. The guy who has probably had the biggest impact on my coaching of the offensive line is Bill Callahan, who is the line coach for the Philadelphia Eagles. I was Billy's graduate assistant at the University of Illinois back in the mid-1980s.

Base Philosophy

I think it is important that I share some of my base philosophy with you so you know where I am coming from. When I was hired to be the head coach two years ago, the president of Hope College asked me what my goals for the program would be. I told him that I wanted to win and make sure that our players graduate. He said that we would both be happy if I could do that. The graduation part was easy. We have only had three players in 27 years who have not graduated from Hope. t is important for me and my staff to be in this game for the players. All of our coaches at Hope also teach. Even in our league, this is unusual now. There are many facets of our players' lives that I want our coaches to be concerned with. I want our coaches to be concerned not only with a young man's physical development, but also with his academic, social, and spiritual development. I don't believe that you have to preach to the kids, but they will act like their coach after a while. That is why it is important that we model ourselves in such a way that they can pick up on it. Discipline becomes more important to me as I get older. For me and our team, I stress it for three reasons: (1) if it will help us win, (2) if it will help our players graduate, and (3) if it will help our players become

 





Page 111

better people. Like all coaches, I want athletes who are disciplined in all phases of their life. For me, this includes physical discipline (lifting, running, staying in shape), mental discipline (this precedes all else), emotional discipline (staying calm under pressure), social discipline (this includes drinking, drugs, friendships, etc.), and spiritual discipline.

I look for leadership at all levels. We expect more from our players the older they get. I do not discipline all of our players the same way. I used to think that you had to treat everyone the same as a coach. I don't believe that anymore. We have more invested in our upperclassmen, so we expect more from them. If we are going to be good, our seniors must be in it with us. It really hasn't been much of a problem for us. I like to use the mind-over-matter principle: I don't mind, and they don't matter.

Our offensive philosophy is based on the premise that we will establish the run first. Running the ball breeds toughness on offense. My quarterback coach tells me all the time that ''the quickest way from here to there is through the air,'' but I tell him that running the ball breeds toughness. Our tailback rushed for over 1100 yards as a sophomore and over 1500 yards this year as a junior. Again, we are committed to running the football.

Second, we are going to use different sets to run the same plays. A good way for our coaches to get a play into our offense is to show me how many different ways we can run the same play. We use motion across the formation, we use short motion, we use tight-end motion, and I would like to start using backfield motion. It has been interesting for me to coach offense after being on the defensive side for nine years. I want to make opposing defensive coordinators work on all kinds of shifts and motions. If they don't, I want to be able to use motions and shifts to give us an advantage. We won't use all the various shifts and motions in every game, but it sure makes our opponents work on things. The basic set that we use is the I formation. We will be in a two-back set about 95 percent of the time.

What It Takes To Block

A. EffortBlocking is hard work. I have to have guys up front who will work hard.

B. SkillsWe do most of our line drills every day. I tell that to our offensive line the first day of camp so they will know what to expect. They know I never get tired of working on the fundamentals of line play, so they better get used to it.

C. KnowledgeWe are fortunate at Hope because our kids are smart. Our average GPA in this year's freshman class is a 3.5, with an average ACT score of 26.

D. StrengthOur kids are getting stronger, but we still have work to do in this area. We test our kids three times a year in the squat, military, bench press x 225, pro shuttle run, body fat, and the 40yard dash. We also do an 8 x 110 test that we picked up from the Bears. We run eight 110-yard sprints with 45 seconds' rest between each one. We found with a timed half mile or mile that our best kids could bust their butt and make the time without being in shape. That is less likely with the 110 test. If they are not in shape, they will not make their time.

E. ToughnessI want to coach scrappy, hard-nosed players.

F. AnticipationI am a big believer in the first step on the offensive line. We win a lot of battles up front with quickness and anticipation off the ball.

G. ConditioningWe probably do less true conditioning during practice time than most high schools. We expect our players to report to camp in shape. We try to drill a lot at full speed to make up for this.

PersonnelWhat We Look For In Offensive Linemen

A. ToughnessPractice it; preach it; accept nothing less.

B. QuicknessQuickness is more important to me than speed. I have seen too many good linemen who have poor 40 times to think that it is vitally important to our success.

 





Page 112

C. Athletic abilityI want athletic ability more than size. If I can have both, of course, that is what we want. Height is not a major concern to be able to adjust on the move.

D. AggressivenessNot a passive mentality. We want the defensive mentality on offense.

What I Want From My Coaches

I think too many times we look at only the players for improvement, when, in fact, improvement from your coaching staff could help you a great deal.

A. Coaches must be a good teachers. This is easy for us, because all of our coaches still teach, just like most of the high school coaches here.

B. They must be demanding. We must tell our players exactly what we want from them and then make sure that it gets done.

C. I want our kids to trust us. You hear a lot of coaches give this lip service, but it really is important. This takes time. I had recruited a good number of our offensive players, but when I switched from defense to the offensive side of the ball two years ago, I had to earn the trust of the offensive players.

D. The fourth thing I want from my coaches is to remember that most individuals still learn far better from positive reinforcement than they do from criticism. I should pay closer attention to this myself. Too often, we are too critical of our players. I started off our preseason meetings a year ago by telling my coaches that unless they had a way to recruit players into the program during the season, they had better complain less about them and concentrate on making the ones we had better.

E. The last thing is to be up front with our players with criticism and praise. If he does something well, make sure you tell him. If he does something poorly, make sure he knows about it. Most of all, we must remember to be positive.

We take a lot of pride in what our team has done and especially in our offensive line. I want my offensive line to be tough, play as a unit, and be as athletic as I can find. We have to have a system, whether it be the zone concept that we are using, or the wing T that many of you use. I coached defense for nine years at Hope. Seven of those years were spent as the defensive line coach. The problem with being an assistant on the opposite side of the ball from the head coach is that you always get players dumped on you from the other side that they don't want. A kid might be third or fourth string, and those other coaches would always try to convince me that he could really help us. It is nice to be the head coach and be able to refuse those switches now.

Why The Zone Blocking Concept?

We switched to the zone offense two years ago after running the wing T for seven years. When I became the head coach, I knew what I wanted to be known for. I wanted our offense to be balanced, and I wanted to have a dominant running game. We have done that. We are now known for our zone running game. Our zone blocking helped our tailback to average 170 yards per game this year. I wanted a blocking conceptnot a schemethat we could use on a variety of running plays. It just seemed to me that with most other offenses, so much time was being spent on scheming and diagramming plays on a weekly basis. I wanted to spend more time on teaching fundamentals and techniques, and this offense allows me to do that.

We didn't rush into the change either. This is the offense that I became familiar with 12 years ago at Illinois. We listened to Tom Osborne and Pete Schmidt talk about this offense in Dallas two years ago, and I met with Bob Nielsen from Wartburg College. We had seen it run effectively at all levels and became more and more convinced that this was what we wanted to do. All of these coaches cautioned us to keep it simple and stick with the base plays, especially in the beginning. I should have listened more closely. We installed too much in 1995. In 1996, we scaled the number of plays back considerably. We decided to do exactly what everyone had cautioned us to do: Keep it simple, and do a few things well.

Now we run three plays from the inside zone: the dive off the option look, the play we call "inside" (the play

 





Page 113

that Tim Biakabuttuko ran so well at Michigan), and the lead draw. From the outside zone, we run the toss sweep (pitch), the option (lead option), and our off-tackle play that we call the slant. We also run some misdirection like the inside trap, the counter, and play action. We basically zone everything, or in the case of the lead draw, we use a man scheme. We really feel that we have to stick to our base plays and not invent new plays each week. This helps so much with our players' confidence, and we can see them improve each week. Since we have very little new learning from week to week, it helps our players to play with more aggressiveness and reckless abandon. We will go through the play book again later this spring. I want every play in there to serve a specific purpose. If it doesn't, then it will have to go. We still practice plays that are not run in the games enough. I have to either call them more or get rid of them. It is hard to let plays go. There are so many good plays that could be run. A lot of teams that run the zone scheme use a handoff sweep. We had it in and got rid of it. It's a great play but didn't give us anything that our toss sweep didn't already give us. We do not change our offense when we get near the goal line. We have to keep it simple. Our kids are not going to the NFL after Hope. They are going to be doctors and lawyers and teachers. We have very little meeting time outside of practice, and I hate to use on-the-field time to talk. I want on-the-field time used for reps as much as possible, so we have to keep it simple.

Our players know that the plays that get us into the red zone will be the plays used in the red zone. There is no reason to change. I like to use the plays that our players have confidence in.

Practice

A. Drill at full speed. This teaches games like angles, body position, reaction to defenders, and conditioning/effort.

B. Drills that pertain to the job must be done.

C. Work body on body as much as possible.

D. Repetitionsmust have it; do it again.

Stance

I want the toes out a little bit and not the other way around as many of us have been coached. I want a balanced stance that will allow us to make contact on the second step. I don't want my linemen to chop their feet in place. Don't get me wrongI want them to have quick feet, but chopping them in place before a drill does not help us get what we want. If you look at tape of offensive line play, you'll notice that you still have to plant your feet to move or to strike a player. I want the weight on the balls of the feet. I want the hand under the chin for balance. I want the feet under the body, again, for balance. As far as the hands go, I don't want a big windup. We work all of our drills with the hands out in front of our bodies. Our splits vary according to three things: (1) the alignment of the defense, (2) the play that is called, and (3) the quality of the defensive personnel that we are facing.

There are two kinds of leverage: inside and underneath. I want the elbows in. It works on the same principle as many of the martial arts. Stay compact on impact for a more direct blow. Tony Wise of the Chicago Bears gave me a great idea on how to work on this. He said to take an old car inner tube, cut it into 1- to 2-inch strips, and use it like a big rubber band. We do a lot of drills with these bands around our wrists to keep our hands and elbows in. I cut these up last summer. Don't make the same mistake I did. I went to the tire shop in town and had the man give me about 15 old inner tubes. I found out that you can make about 500 bands out of 15 inner tubes. One or two will give you all the bands you need.

Blocking is not the same as it was in the old days. We don't grab our jerseys and shoulder-block anymore. It is important to keep the hands inside the cylinder of the body. This helps cut down on holding penalties too. The second kind of leverage is underneath leverage. The low man will win most battles in the line. We work to keep our pad level lower than our opponent's. On many of the drills we do, I tell my linemen that they should be looking up at the chin of the man they are blocking.

Our first step really just gets us into position. We must stay square on blocks and stay on balance. Many times, we can't tell who is on offense and who is on defense at the line. We are both working for the same thing. Our first step will vary with alignment. Steps 2 and 3 will make or break our blocks. We have to make contact and then accelerate. I want our linemen to make contact with the shoulder and then bench-press the defender to gain separation. A couple of my guys like to make contact with the head. We don't coach this because (1) it is dangerous and (2) it gets us overextended. We don't want defenders getting into our body, and that is exactly what happens when you make helmet contact. Defensively, that is great to do. We must keep separation on offense. I want the helmet on the play side, and we teach our guys to squeeze back with the head and neck. The best rule that we have is this: When in doubt, step play-side and drive. This is the first lesson that I tried to instill in my offensive line. In talking with the Bears, I know they like to use very little apparatus like dummies or shields, and I agree to a point. I don't like for our guys to block dummies, but I will use a Rogers Lev sled fairly often. I just feel that blocking a dummy forces our linemen to put their head down and bend at the waist. I've been asked about the type of steps we take on a base reach block. It varies, because the best way to describe it is to take what you can get. Alignment will affect this, but mostly it will be affected by the type of player on the other side of the line. As far as the centers go, I want them to snap and step at the same time. This would be ideal but not always realistic. Sometimes our center snaps the ball and steps back just to keep from getting rolled. I want our centers to work on this snap-and-step action every day.

We have very few blocks to make in a game. Other than trapping for the guards (which really is not part of the zone offense), we base block, base reach, and combo. In essence, what we are trying to do is create as many initial double teams as possible. The inside hand should hit the sternum, and the outside hand should go to the shoulder near the armpit. After two years of running this offense, I will tell you this. Zone blocking is easy to learn and tough to master. It is not complicated mentally. We only make two calls on the line, covered or uncovered. The best thing our linemen can do is to help us recruit good backs like we had this year.

We had Brett Kohler from Edwardsburg and Steve Sanders from Grandville sharing time at fullback. We also used a freshman, Scott Langlois from Hopkins. All three of them can block and run like trucks. At tailback we are fortunate to have Brandon Graham from Hudsonville, who rushed for 1525 yards on 270 carries in nine games with 21 touchdowns. My math isn't great, but that is over 5.5 yards per carry. To put it in perspective for our level, Barry Sanders led the NFL with 1553 yards on 307 carries for a 5.1 average and 11 touchdowns in 16 games. Terry Allen led the NFL in touchdowns this year with 21. Our tailback rushed for 21 touchdowns in nine games. Brandon Graham is the best back I have ever coached. I know there are better backs out there at other levels, but he is the best I have ever personally been around. He ran the toss sweep successfully on everyone we played this year.

Keys To Our Zone Blocking

1. We are blocking an area. We must block the line of scrimmage first, but we have to block the second level as well.

2. We must get movement at the point of attack. Backside blocks are more of what I call position blocks, but the we must have movement frontside.

Quarterback Drills and the Passing Game

Furman University

I tried to get my wife to type out the information for the overhead, but she insisted that I do it, so here goes. First, I want to talk about seven traits of a great quarterback.

1. He must demonstrate leadership and responsibility. The quarterback must be able to communicate in tough situations. He must be willing to take the blame and the glory. He must be a leader on and off the field.

2. He must be a competitor. He must hate to lose. He must be competitive in practice. He must be ready to compete in all phases of the game.

3. He must be confident. He must have confidence to the borderline of being cocky. He must inspire confidence in his teammates.

4. He must have credibility. We hear the expression, "You're the man." In football, the quarterback must be "The Man." His teammates must believe in him. When it is 3rd and 6 on the last drive and you must stick the ball in the end zone, 
the team must believe in him.

5. He must have an instinctive mental process. He must be able to react on the move. He must know all of the assignments for the entire team.

6. He must have a quick delivery. I know it is great to have a quarterback who is big and can run, but if you are going to throw the ball today, you must have a quarterback who has a quick delivery. He must not wind up to throw the ball. He must be able to get the ball out of his hand.

7. He must be a playmaker. This is the most important of these seven traits. He must make the difference in winning and losing.

A quarterback must believe in himself, and his work must convince his teammates that he can be trusted when all else fails. I think this about sums everything up about the quarterback's position. The quarterback is the man who must step up and make the play. He must get the ball in the hands of the best receiver or the best running back. He must be trusted by his teammates.

The big thing we look at in the passing efficiency rating is this: How many interceptions did the quarterback throw? The next thing we look at is percentage of completions. I will talk about accuracy percentage later.

Next, I want to talk about drills we do in practice. First, we run air routes. We start with wide receivers. Later we bring in the tailback, fullback, and tight ends. We want a lot of air routes thrown during the early practice.

The next route we work on is one of the best for the wide receivers. It is a one-on-one versus the defensive backs. We also use the tight end in the drill. We split the receiver, and the defensive man lines up and plays him man-to-man.

 





Page 119

We have a stopwatch on the quarterback because we do not want him to hold the ball too long. We want the ball gone in less than 2.8 seconds.

Next, we work on a combo route. We have two receivers going against two defenders: a safety and a corner. The defense will play what we call a two-read coverage, or they will be playing quarters. It gives our receivers a chance to see what the defense is doing with their coverage. Myself, I like to get the linebackers involved in the defense. We add them to the drill later on.

The next drill is with our tight end, tailback, and fullback against three linebackers. We call this the Dallas drill. The defense can play their different coverages as we run our different routes against them.

Then we go to our skeleton drill. This is where we bring our skilled people on offense to go against the entire defensive secondary. This is our team passing drill. This is our best drill. We never want our quarterback to get hit in this drill. He must stand in the pocket and throw the football. Then we go to an 11-on-11 drill. This is where we let it all out, and the quarterback must make the play.

We keep an accuracy percentage on our quarterbacks. Also, we keep a completion percentage on them. If the pass is dropped by a receiver, it is counted as a completion for us in this chart.

If the ball is batted-and we see this in the film-I give them the benefit of the doubt and count it as a completion. If the quarterback throws the ball away to prevent a sack, we do not count it as anything. It is not counted as a catch or an attempt. Every day in practice we have a goal for the type of passes we throw.

Last year, our quarterback had a passing accuracy of 77 percent. He did a good job of getting rid of the ball, although we had several passes dropped.

Next, I want to get into the drills for our quarterbacks. We are going to do four drills every day before practice. A lot of you have been to our camp and know these four drills. I do not want my quarterbacks to warm up unless I am out there with them. I do not want them to get into any bad habits. I want to be with them when they are warming up.

1. Toes-on drillWe want the quarterback to put his toes on the line about shoulders' width apart. The quarterbacks are going to be 10 yards apart. We want the quarterback to rotate his shoulders and use his upper body. His feet should never leave the ground. We want him to set the ball, turn the hips, and work on the shoulder rotation. He must come over the top with the ball. He rotates his shoulders from one sideline to the other sideline. This drill helps them to get loose. We really stress setting the ball. We want the ball up high on the drill.

2. Weight-shift drillThe quarterbacks are still 10 yards apart. They take their back foot and put it on the line. We do not want them to rock all the way back, but we do want them to shift their weight. We talk to them about finishing the throw just as they would if they were a baseball pitcher. We want them to transfer the weight, take a six- to eight-inch stride, and set the foot. Again, we stress the follow-through.

3. Step-n-strideAgain, the quarterbacks are going to put their foot on the back line, take a short stride toward the target, and throw. They are working on a short stride, and they are standing tall. Again, we concentrate on the follow-through. They are just like a baseball pitcher. We want them to come over the top.

4. Crossover plantWe simulate being at the top of our drop. Now we are going to cross over and plant the foot and throw the football. We stress balance and the weight transfer with the shoulders level. The most important step in the drop for the quarterback is the fourth step. He has

 





Page 120

to break the momentum to cross over and plant. If the fourth step is too long, he will never be able to throw the ball without gathering his feet. We do these four drills every day. We make sure we are on the field to supervise them. We want reps, reps, and more reps.

Next we go to a series of quarterback drop drills. The quarterback is not throwing the football; he is dropping back. We do all of these drills on the lines. We start on the sideline.

First is the distance drop. I blow a whistle, and they start the drill. The quarterbacks drop all the way across the field. It is full speed all the way across the field. We want them to stay on the line and to keep the head up and shoulders level and work the football. This is sideline to sideline. The drop is second nature, and it helps lengthen the drop. This is how we warm up. You can vary the distance if you want. At times in practice, we may have them drop 100 yards. We put them on the goal line and have them drop all the way down the field. This is usually after they have made several mistakes.

Next is the swivel-hips drill. Again, they start out on the sideline. I blow the whistle, and they are going to drop. I blow the whistle again, and they swivel or rotate the hips. We want them to stay on the midline. We do this all the way across the field. I blow the whistle, and they rotate. On every whistle they must rotate the hips. We want them to try to stay on the midline. We want them to keep their feet working.

The third drill is the carioca drop. This drill is used to improve footwork. The upper body remains the same. This drill goes well with our big-five drop, which I will discuss later. Again, we are sideline to sideline. We start out and carioca all the way across the field. We want to stay on the midline. The upper body remains the same. The lower body must do the work in a carioca-type style. It is very good for developing footwork. We like to stress this point with our quarterbacks. Playing quarterback starts from the ground up. Feet, feet! If they have good feet, they have a chance.

Next is the tapioca drop. It is the same as the carioca drop except the quarterback is giving a quick washing-machine action. We want real short choppy steps. We go from the sideline to the hash mark on this drill. We start out by straddling the sideline. Everything is the same as the carioca drill, except we are speeding things up. Again, this drill goes well with our quick-five action. We do not take many seven-step drops anymore. The defensive ends in college are too good. We are a quick-five-action team and a big-five team.

The fifth drill is what we call our alternate drops. Now the mind and body must work together. It is the same thing. They start on the sideline. We may be working on the big five, quick five that day, or we may be working on three quick steps. We may be going three quick and big in the drill. I will blow the whistle, and the quarterbacks go 1, 2, 3, and throw to the right. When I say, "Throw to the right," they get the ball and bring it to the other hand. Then they reset and go again down the line. They throw and reset all the way across the field.

The sixth drill is one that we have been doing a great deal of lately. It is what we call our mental drops. I line the quarterbacks up in front of me, and they get on the hash mark. I will call the formation, the play, and the defensive coverage to them. Then I will say, "Sam runs to the flat." Then I blow the whistle. They take their drop, a quick five or a big five. Then they must throw the ball to the receiver they think will be open. The quarterback drops and goes through his reads mentally. I know who they are throwing to. If they screw up, I help them. This is way they are going to learn to throw the ball in a game. This is something you must do over and over.

Next, I want to go over our throwing drills. The first is what we call the release drill. We have two quarterbacks standing side by side. We have a wide receiver in front of the quarterback, but it could be a manager, another quarterback, or another player. The coach stands in front of the receivers. If we have an injured wide receiver who can take part in the drill, we will use them. The quarterback is in a set position. When the coach throws his hand up, the quarterback must release the ball to the receiver.

 





Page 121

RELEASE DRILL

The quarterback is in a set position. The coach will throw his hands up in the air. The quarterback releases the ball as quickly as possible. Start at 15 yards apart, and vary the depth and angle of throws. Get the ball out of your hands!

Next is our carioca drop-n-throw and our tapioca dropn-throw. We have a quarterback and a wide receiver. First the coach blows the whistle. The quarterback must carioca and set his feet. The whistle blows again and he throws the football to the receiver.

CARIOCA DROP-N-THROW AND TAPIOCA DROP-N-THROW

The coach blows the whistle. The quarterback takes the snap and carioca- or tapioca-drops. The coach blows the whistle again. The quarterback sets his feet and delivers the ball. You can vary the spots for the receiver. The whistle may blow while the quarterback s in the middle of the carioca. If that happens, the quarterback must get set and throw the football as soon as possible. We do not want to run the drills where we are throwing the ball straight ahead all of the time. We like to practice throwing at angles. Throw at a spot. If you run a curl that week, work on the curl route. We like to let the quarterback throw to the spot where he will be throwing to in a game.

In the tapioca drill we take quicker and choppier steps. Now we want to get the ball away much quicker. That is what our quick-five pass drop is. We take the short, choppy steps.

The fourth throwing drill is what we call our avoid drill. You may not want to work on this, but we feel we have to.

AVOID DRILL

The quarterback takes the snap and drops on a quick-five or a big-five drop. He sets on the fifth step. He must avoid the rush to the right or left. Then he must sidestep and throw the ball to the wide receiver. He must reset his feet before throwing the ball. If he gets pressure from one side, he must slide, reset his feet, and then throw. We have the dummies set up deep enough to simulate the depth that we want the quarterback to drop. Most quarterbacks want to get out of the pocket when they get pressure. It is a feeltype thing that the quarterback must experience. The way to work on that is running this drill over and over. You work on throwing from both sides.

Next is our step-up drill. Now the quarterback must step up in the pocket to make the pass.

STEP-UP DRILL

 





Page 122

We take two defenders, who can be other players, quarterbacks, or managers, to rush the quarterback. The quarterback takes his drop and checks the rush. We rush at the angle that the defensive ends will be rushing in the game. The quarterback must step up in the pocket and make the throw.

Next is our pressure drill. Do not let anyone do this but the coach. As soon as the quarterback releases the ball, the coach throws a hand dummy at the quarterback. Do not hit the quarterback anywhere near his throwing hand. Again, do not let anyone throw the dummy except the coach.

PRESSURE DRILL

I like to use this drill on individual routes. I have a hand shield, and I throw it at the quarterback as soon as he releases the football. I do not sling the dummy, I throw it at the quarterback. Again, we do not want to hit the quarterback on his throwing arm. We want to simulate the type of pressure they will see in the game.

The last drill we use in our throwing drills is our clock drill. The coach will point to the wide receiver. The wide receiver flashes his hands. The quarterback must work from his right to his left and from his left to his right. The quarterback must step and turn on each target. You can have as many receivers as you want. We want the quarterback to move his feet and shoulders together.

CLOCK DRILL

If I flash my hands to the number one receiver, the quarterback must throw the ball as soon as possible. If I flash the number two receiver, the quarterback can look at number one and then come off to number two receiver. You can build this in with the different pass routes you are running. We mix it up on the patterns.

We feel it is very important to take the first 15 minutes in practice and work on these drills. It is very important for us to do them, especially this year. What we like to do is to get out to the practice field and warm up, then do our flexes, and then get into our drills. After we get through with the drills, we go to individual routes.

Next we go to our quarterback throwing techniques. These are the things we work on.

Lower bodyStep toward the target, and shift the weight. We want a flex in the left knee. We want the quarterback to allow the hips to come through. We want to take a short stride. We want to follow through toward the target. That is the number one thing that we stress. When the quarterback throws the football, he wants the hips and everything else to follow through straight forward.

Upper bodyWe want to set the ball high. We want to get it up in the air. We want the quarterback to turn the ball away. We like to say that we take the football off the shelf. This is what we teach in our camp in the summer. The elbow must be at 90 degrees. The elbow must be higher than the shoulder. The lead arm must assist with rotation of the shoulders. We want to snap the throw-off.

I am not a big grip person. We want the quarterback to snap off the throw with his finger rotation. If the quarterback is throwing with a normal rotation, I will leave him alone. If the ball is wobbly, we work on the rotation with that quarterback. We want the quarterback to use as little motion as possible in throwing the ball. We want to get the ball out of the hand of the quarterback.

The next area is the passing sequence. This is after the drop. First, we want to stand tall and be balanced.

 





Page 123

We want to set the ball high. Next, we must step toward the target. We want to throw the ball with finger rotation. We want RPMs on the ball. And last but not least, we want to follow through to the target.

The second problem is that they are unbalanced after the drop. The front shoulder should be up.

The third problem is that the lead arm folds. This does not do them any good. We want to make sure that the lead arm pulls them through.

Next I want to talk about the two-man game. This is where we break the routes down. The first thing we do that is different from what most people do is that we put the tailback in the halfback position behind the tight end. Most teams put their fullback in that position. We move our tailback to that position. We have our tailback and tight end working together. Our fullback goes to the split-end side. This is a standard set for us, especially in a passing situation. I want to break it down, take about three individual routes, and go over them.

First is the flat route. The depth of a flat route is 3 yards from the line of scrimmage. If the tailback is deeper than 3 yards, he is wrong. We stress width. We say width is more important than depth. He wants to reach the line of scrimmage 3 yards outside the tight end. After he gets to the 3-yard area, he should bend it outside. As soon as he reaches the line of scrimmage, he must snap the head around and look for the ball. More important than depth is for the tailback to get leverage on the Sam linebacker.

FLAT ROUTE

The choice route is run by the fullback. He goes to a depth of 4 yards versus a zone and 6 yards against man coverage. When he reaches the line of scrimmage, he wants to be 4 yards outside the tackle's alignment. Against the zone, he wants to snap his head to the outside and anchor his feet to the ground. Against man coverage, he wants to get vertical and give the Will linebacker a jab step to the inside. The key to the route is to get vertical. If he does not get vertical, he does not have a chance out there.

CHOICE ROUTE

Next is our option route by our tight end. All of these routes can be run out of all three wideouts. This route is for the inside receiver. The depth is 6 to 8 yards. It is a backyard route. The receiver does just the opposite of what the linebacker does. The receiver has three options. (1) If the linebacker walls the receiver off, he must plant and break to the outside. He wants to lean back to the quarterback. (2) If the linebacker drops over the top of the receiver, he hooks to the inside. (3) If the receiver passes the linebacker, he turns back to the inside.

OPTION ROUTE

If we make a quick-five call, our quarterback is going to take five quick steps and shift his weight to this back foot and throw the football right now. This is our two-man game. His first option is to read the Sam linebacker. If we have Sam outflanked, we want to throw the ball to that receiver. We throw that route until they change the defense. A quick five to us is usually a 5- to 6-yard drop of our quarterback, but we are getting the ball away very quickly.

If Sam has our first receiver covered, the quarterback will reset and throw the option route. If the option

 





Page 124

route is covered, the quarterback resets and throws to the choice receiver. It is a quick 1, 2, 3. It is just like the clock drill we just did.

This is what the routes look like against what we call cover-two float. The Mike linebacker cannot cover the tight end if he is going deep enough. If the safety gets uptight, we send the wideout deep inside behind him.

R-L VS. COVER-TWO FLOAT

What happens if we see cover three? If we get cover three we can work on either side. We work against both sides. We like to work the backside post. We want the wide receiver to break inside at 8 yards and catch the football on the hash mark.

ROWLEE VS. COVER THREE

Let me show you the same route from different sets. These are what we call our Row and Lee sets.

ROWLEE VS. TWO FLOAT

If we call 
move, 
we can set the tailback to the splitend side, bring him back in motion, and run the same play. It is simply 830 flat choice.

ROBLIZMOVE VS. TWO FLOAT

We went with a one-back set and ran the same plays.

DOUBLESONE-BACK SET

Everything we teach on routes develops off this route. This is where we start out teaching. In the no-backs set, notice where the B receiver is lined up. We ran the 839 flat choice route.

839 FLAT CHOICEEMPTY

This gives the defense a different look, but it is the same route. We want to give the quarterback as much of an edge as we can. That is our two-man game. There are a lot of ways you can do it.

Goal-Line Offense

Mt. Carmel High School, Illinois

Thank you. I appreciate all of you being here; believe me, I do. I will tell you, I do not have time for any jokes. I want to get right to teaching about football.

One thing we try to get across to our players is this. We talk to teach; we listen to learn. We teach this to our kids in school, in football, and we should keep this point in mind this weekend as well. How do we learn? There are basically three ways we learn. We learn through the people we meet, we learn through the books we read, and we learn through the tapes we watch or listen to. Those are the three basic ways in which we learn.

This weekend they will have a clinic manual available. Invest in the clinic manual. It is a great manual and will contain articles you can learn from. A magazine I brought with me is excellent. It is the 
American Football Quarterly 
It is put out by a man who played for Bear Bryant at Alabama. I think the magazine runs about $20 per year. It is the best magazine of its kind that I have seen or read. You can call those people up and tell them you heard about it from me. I do not have anything invested in the magazine, but I would like to see it continue. Their number is 1-800-537-4271. Keep in mind the three ways we learn. Go buy books on how to teach, how to learn, business, and leadership. Make yourself a better teacher, and you will automatically make yourself a better coach.

This is what we try to get across to our staff: We are going to achieve whatever we emphasize. I coach our offensive line. We emphasize coming off the ball low, hard, and quick. We emphasize having great splits in our line. We emphasize taking care of the little things. Keep this point in mind. As coaches, we are going to achieve whatever we emphasize. If we make it important to the kids, it will become second nature to them as we go along. Teach your kids to play the game with their feet and their eyes. You do not have to have great speed, but if you have great feet, you can play the game. We tell our players it is just like a car accident: speed kills.

We want to be great technicians. We want our kids to be great technique players. We have had some great athletes. However, we have had some kids who have developed into great technique players. We want to develop leaders in our program.

We have players all over the country who will be team captains next year. We have had some great players come out of our program. Some of you may have heard of Simeon Rice, who was the third player taken in the NFL draft last year. He came to Mt. Carmel as a running back. He did not even want to play defense. We talked him into playing defense, and now he is worth a lot of money. The point I am making is that you can have players with ability, but you still have to coach them and teach them.

I am going to talk about goal-line offense. If you are going to be a good football team, you better be good with your special teams. Think about the amount of time you spend on special teams. We spend four days a week, from 15 to 30 minutes a day, working on our special teams. To win, we know we must play great defense. From 1988 to 1991, we were in four straight state championships. We went 10 consecutive quarters in the state championship play without giving up a point. We finally gave up a touchdown because our offense turned the ball over. The point is that you have to emphasize all of those areas to be a good football team.

The things that I want to talk about today are not just X's and O's. My total topic is goal-line offense: theory, concepts, and practice. It is important to know how to practice on the goal line as well. First, I want to go over our overall offensive philosophy. Our offense is based on execution. We want to do something our athletes can do, as opposed to something they can't

 





Page 126

do. We make sure they do it; if they won't, we find someone else. We do not settle for anything less. When we say they won't, I mean attitude-wise they will not do what we ask. You find some kids that will not take to your coaching. Sometimes we may play a kid with less talent but one who will take coaching. If you have a great athlete and he does not do the things you ask him to do, I will assure you that he will get you beat somewhere down the road. You win with the little things: huddle, steps, alignment. Close games are won by the team that does the little things right. Little things will turn into big things. We insist that our players do the little things right.

We have a term that we use; we call it this: ''Be brilliant on the basics.'' Let me talk about fundamentals. Teaching must be done in the classroom and not on the field. At our school, the players report to the locker rooms immediately after school. Two days a week, the defensive players go into a classroom as soon as they get out of school. The offensive players go get taped or start getting dressed. At the end of 15 minutes, the offense and defense switch. While one group is getting dressed, the other team is in a team meeting. We go over our scouting reports, and we give the players handouts we have prepared. We begin to let them see what the big picture looks like. We do not want to waste time doing that on the field. We want to get after it once we get outside.

We feel it is very important to get a lot of repetitions on the field. The whistle blows; the coach is on the run. We want to coach them on the run. Get after them. Don't make it a laissez-faire attitude. Put a sense of urgency into your coaching. Coach them on the run. Our coaches are on the go! I am on the go. Our kids do not want to be the last one to get to a group drill. I jog to the drills, and the kids run to beat me there. We let them know when they are doing a good job. We let them know that we are interested in them becoming better people, better students, and better athletes.

Mental errors will not be tolerated. Players must know what to do and how to do it! That is part of our job. We have to be able to answer the whys and wherefores. Coach the kids; teach them what to do and how to do it. Offense is a team game. The team is far more important than the individual. We are not interested in setting statistical records. We played all 80 or our players in 11 of our 14 games this past year. That is more kids than we usually carry on the team, but we played them. We are only one of three teams in the history of Illinois that has scored over 600 points in one season. For the 13 years that I have been at Mt. Carmel, we have never had an area leading rusher, a leading passer, a leading receiver, or a leading anything. That is because we believe football is a team game. We spread the ball around, and we give everyone an opportunity on both sides of the football to play the game.

Consistency is a must in order to be successful. You must live and die with your offense, defense, and kicking game. You can't change things around in the middle of the season. I am amazed at some coaches who change their offense from year to year. How do you know how the people you will be playing against will adjust? You have to make a commitment to an offense that you believe in and go with it. You have to work on the offense. You can't be adding play after play week after week. You get down to the end of the season, and you need a roll of toilet paper to write down all the plays you have run for the season. Pick the things you feel are important, emphasize those points, and then have your players become great technicians.

We subscribe to the John Wooden philosophy. Before we worry what the other team is going to do, we want to be concerned with what we do. In August when we first get started, we never worry about working on the first opponent. We work our offense against our defense and our kicking game against our kicking game. We are going to make sure that our kids are good at what we need to do to be successful. We do not look at the scouting report of our first opponent until the week of that first game. We are going to be excellent at what we do first and foremost.

This sign is on our wall in our locker room: "Football should be fun!" Fun comes from doing things well and enjoying success. It is just like a classroom. It is fun to

 





Page 127

do well on a test. We want it to be the same way on the field. You can have fun in practice if you can see that you are getting better. You can coach them on the run and push them to get better. We want to make sure that the players are doing things right. Look for a perfect practice. Are we ever going to get a perfect practice? Probably not, but we are going to push and strive for it. We are not going to accept anything less than the best effort. When the season is over, I do not want a player to come up to me and say, "Coach, we could have been better." Would'a, could'a, should'a. When it is all said and done, we want the kids to know that we did everything that we possibly could have done.

This is something we do at the start of the year. I call all the coaches up around me. I have all of the players out in front. I ask the players to hold up their hands if they want to be coached by a coach that gives them a half-ass effort. "Raise your hand." No one raises their hands, naturally. Then I say this: "Men, our coaches do not want to coach players that only give them a half-ass effort!" Everyone must be in the same boat. Everyone must believe in what we are doing. This may be a little thing, but the light goes on with some of the kids. They know they must put their heart and soul into what we are doing.

Confidence comes from consistency. Goal line must take a top priority. There is no reason to get down there if we can't score. We must study ourselves and go over and over our goal-line package. It is important that you study yourself. I will cover this again later. Everyone must be doing the best he is capable of doing and nothing less. We never walk on the field, coaches and players alike. Coaches must coach on the go!

Goal-Line Offense: Theories And Principles

Here are some theories and principles that we believe in. This is more important than giving you our X's and O's. If we have time, I will show you some of the things we do on the goal line. What I am going to cover with you now are ideas that you can develop and use in your offense, regardless of the offense you use on the goal line.

You attack the defense in two ways: (1) in an 
area 
where the defense is somewhat weaker and (2) a particular 
individual 
whose style of play can be exploited. We concentrate more on the first point, which is to attack an area. When I first started coaching, we would attack the individual first. But what I found out was this. We would pick out an individual who we felt we could exploit, and we worked on plays against that individual. However, that player's coach could see what was happening to that player, and by the time they played us, they had pulled that player out of the lineup. We wasted time working against a player who did not even play against us. Now, that does not mean that we are not going to look at attacking an individual, but first we are going to look at an area to exploit the defense.

We want to present a well-balanced offensive attack inside the 10-yard line. What does balanced mean? It does not necessarily mean 50-50. I can't tell you what well balanced means for you. You must decide what the balance is for your team. We like the balance to be about 60-40 in favor of the run. If we look at our offense and find that we are running the ball 80 percent of the time, we will make an effort to include more passing in our attack to get back to being balanced in our attack.

We want to force the defense to balance up to our offensive formations. We can go from three wide receivers to two tight ends with the same personnel. Do you change your personnel on the goal line, or do you use the same personnel? We run the split-back veer-option offense. We do not have to change personnel. The same offense we are running on the 40-and 50-yard line is the same offense we will be running down on the goal line. I get confused when I see teams that run the I formation in the middle of the field and then get down on the goal line and go to the wishbone formation. To me, that is an entirely different offense that you have to spend time on in practice.

We like to run option football inside the 10-yard line. We continue to attack on a broad front. Coach Lou Holtz use to say this: "Don't flinch." If option football got you down to the 10-yard line, don't be afraid to call

 





Page 128

it again. One point I learned from Bo Schembechler at Michigan is this: You better believe in everything that you do, and you had better be ready to sell it to everyone involved. If you can't do that, you will never be successful. When I first became the defensive coordinator in my first two years at Mt. Carmel High School, we were a Rip-and-Liz, power-I football team. People told me that I would be fired in two years if I tried to run an option offense in our conference. We can knock on wood, because we have had good kids and they have been able to overcome my coaching. We are still at Mt. Carmel after 13 years.

It is important to maintain good line splits on the goal line. How many of you here today tell your players on offense to close their splits down when the defense gets in the gaps? We do not tell our kids to cut their splits down because the defense is in the gaps. We want good line splits because gap defenses give us good angles. That does not mean that you have to run every play in your offense down on the goal line. Run the plays that are going to be conducive to success on the goal line. Don't run plays that you are going to have a hard time being successful on.

Eliminate mistakes on the goal line. This includes fumbles and penalties. Missed assignments mean stops. Everyone in this room knows this, but do we coach our kids in that manner? Do we teach the kids these things? Stop the stoppers. We do not want things that are going to stop us on the goal line. We want to eliminate them in practice.

We want to control the line of scrimmage. If the defense does penetrate, we want to use it to our advantage. Our number one play on the goal line is our outside veer. If the defense tries to pinch the tackle and end down inside to stop the outside veer, we look at the next phase of plays that we want to go to in order to be successful. If the defense takes away A, are we good enough to go to B? If they can take away A and B, do we have C available? We want to sustain our blocks and block lower on the goal line. We want to get the shoulders into the end zone. We want movement at the point of attack. We tell our linemen to finish the play with their shoulders over the end zone. This is particularly true from the 5-yard line on in. Think about it, coach. If I coach the line to finish the play with their shoulders in the end zone, where will the back probably be? Right behind the linemen in the end zone. We tell our linemen that they are successful if they finish the play with their shoulders in the end zone.

We will use all four backs, so we can run our plays to either side with equal speed, deception, finesse, and power. I will show you this in our tape. We run the same plays but block them a little differently. We insist that our backs run low and harder through the end zone. Here are a couple of coaching points. How many times have you seen the backs run into the line at the 5-yard line with their heads down? If your eyes are down and you get hit, your body is going down. The first thing we teach our kids is to get their eyes up and to look for the back of the end zone. It does not matter if you are running 8 yards or 80 yards, our kids are going to run through the back of the end zone. The back has a better chance of staying up if he has his eyes up, looking for the back of the end zone. Most people tell their backs to tuck the ball away and to get the front hand over the ball. We tell our backs to get the ball in front of them on the goal line. We want the pads down, eyes up, and the ball in front on the chest with one or two hands on the ball.

We want to throw the play-action pass off our most effective runs. We use crossing patterns versus man coverage. Because we are an option team, we like to use dump and curl routes. These things fit our scheme. You have to decide what will fit in with your scheme. Throw the play-action pass off your most effective runs. That is a big key.

We want to keep pressure on the defense. Our tempo must be at its best. When we get inside your 20, we want them excited. We want a sense of urgency. We are trying to get the plays in as fast as we can. We want to create a sense of urgency, and we do not want to give the defense a chance to rest. Our kids are going to hustle up to the line and get down, and they are going to go. We are going to get after them as quickly as we possibly can. Again, what we want to do is to keep the pressure on the defense.

 





Page 129

We use sequence football when possible. You only need four or five runs and three or four passes. When we are down inside the 15- to 10-yard line, we do not need a lot of offense. How many patterns do we need? We need something that will work against man coverage and something that will work against zone coverage. I am not saying that you cannot use dropback passing on the goal line, but we find that we have better success with play-action passes.

Effort and execution equal success! Our kids hear our coaches yelling out all of the time: "Think and execute; think and execute. Effort and execution; effort and execution." Those are vital concepts to our kids, and they understand the concept. They live with it, and they believe it. Our weekly goal-line package is simply a limited version of our base package. It allows for consistency. We are not going from one formation to another once we get on the goal line.

Let me talk about some advantages of our goal-line offense. Again, see if these advantages apply to your situation. You should write down what you think the advantages are for you and your goal-line offense. Here are the advantages of the split backs on the goal line. First is continuity. You stay with the same offense that got you there. Next is simplicity. It reduces the teaching time and techniques. When we teach our offense in August, there is very little we have to do after that. We do have to polish it up from time to time. The key is that we want our kids to be great technicians. In the last 11 years, we have continued to play until the last week of the season nine times. We have gone down the road as far as you could go in nine of those 11 years. Some of the drills we teach in August we are still doing the last week of the season as far as fundamentals are concerned. Be brilliant on the basics. Don't shortchange your kids there.

The third advantage of our offense is that it builds confidence. It can be done, and you can prove it with statistics. Develop your own statistics. If you are a varsity coach, don't have the varsity coaches keep track of the stats. If you do, they will make them say whatever they want them to say. Have a coach on the JV or frosh level take care of the stats. If you are a defensive coach, have a coach on offense keep the defensive stats, and vice versa. By doing it this way, the stats mean more to your team and can be helpful.

Next, I want to talk about some prerequisites for any goal-line offense. First, you can't stop yourself. What are you going to emphasize? What are your goals? The ideal goal is to score 100 percent of the time inside the 10-yard line. I do not know of any team that can do that, but it is the ideal goal. You might say that we want to score 70 percent of the time inside the 10-yard line. Then look to see if you are doing the things that will allow you to be successful.

We want to identify our bread-and-butter back and get him the football. Does that mean every down? No! If you are smart, it does not mean every first down. It may mean that you will fake the ball to that back and throw the play-action pass.

You must evaluate your statistics. Do you always run the ball on first down? The opponents have that figured out if you do. Give yourself an opportunity to be successful. Come up with the play-action pass on first down to throw them off balance. We take a look at our goal-line efficiency. We look at the situation and chart the number of times we are successful and the number of times we fail. If we scored a touchdown, we want to know why we were successful. If we had to settle for a field goal, we want to know why we did not score the touchdown. Did we do a poor job, did we make the right call, or did we get a penalty? We want to know why we were successful or why we failed.

Look at the reasons why you failed to score. Fumble! Was it a contact fumble or an exchange fumble? If it was because of contact, you will need to emphasize proper handling of the ball. You have to emphasize this to the ball carrier and motivate him to hold on to the football. If it was on the exchange, we want to know if it was caused by penetration, poor technique, or a missed assignment.

Another reason why we fail to score on the goal line is because of interceptions. Why did you throw? Was

 





Page 130

it play selection? Was it because of poor mechanics on the part of the quarterback? Was it because of fundamentals of throwing, catching, or pass protection?

Penalties will stop you from scoring on the goal line. Concentration mistakes can't be tolerated. Your starting count must not be too complicated. You cannot have too much in the cadence.

You should evaluate your first-down calls. Make sure you self-scout. Know what you like to do on offense. Review your play-selection philosophy. Do not just grab plays that you like. Decide whether you are going to attack alignment or personnel. You need to use the press box for help. Are we getting the expected look? Are we seeing the defense we worked against in practice? We have gotten very good in our goal-line offense over the last several years, so that teams are now playing us with their regular defense inside the 10-yard line. They are using their base defense to try to stop the things that we do best on the goal line.

You need to be aware of the clock when you are on the goal line. Do you have a no-huddle stop-the-clock play? Do you have a two-play sequence that you can run from the line of scrimmage? It could be run-run, run-pass, pass-run, or pass-pass. We give our two-play sequence a name. We call it 
caravan. 
You can call it whatever you want. You must prepare for a situation when you do not have time to call two plays.

Next, I want to get to our goal-line offense. Later we will talk about practice time. Our 36 and 37 outside veer is the best short-yardage and goal-line play we have. This is our version of a power off-tackle play. We are a split-back-veer team, but we usually get a double team at the point of attack if we have a tight end in the home position. Our quarterback has one read and one reaction. We are going to read the end on the line of scrimmage, and we react to the defensive back or linebacker, whoever is the next man to show up. We have one read and one reaction. If you are going to run option football and tell the quarterback that he has two reads, you are whistling in the wind. That is not going to happen. It is too much to ask of a quarterback. We ask him to make one read and one reaction. If we run the play correctly, the outside veer will result in a three-on-two advantage. You do not have to be a great option team to run that play. We are going to combo or double-team at the point of attack. Again, it is our power off-tackle play.

I want to make sure we talk about practice time. Our weekly goal-line package is a limited version of our base offense. This allows us to minimize our goal-line practice, concentrate on potential problem situations, and perfect our execution.

Here is exactly what we do during the week. We play most of our home games Saturday night. When I was a student at Mt. Carmel, our league played all of our games on Sunday afternoon. When the Chicago Catholic High School started playing football in the 1920s, there was no NFL to compete with. Now our kids always have Sunday off, unless we are playing. Monday is a light day for us. We go out in helmets and shorts. Tuesday is our first weekday in pads. We work 10 minutes on our goal-line offense against any unusual defensive fronts you may show us on the goal line in our next game or against what we think you may show us based on your package. On Wednesday we spend 10 minutes on your base goal-line defense. Once we get into the season, we do very little full contact. We do go live on the goal line. We get after it. It is ones versus our ones. There is less chance in getting someone hurt on the goal line.

When we teach tackling in the preseason, we have one rule. You can never tackle anyone on your own team below the waist. That does two things for us. First, it saves on ankle and knee injuries. Second, it makes our defensive players better tacklers. They have to run to be in position to make tackles. They can't just be diving at people. We never allow anyone to tackle below the waist in practice.

On Thursday our goal-line offense works against any defensive stunts and combinations of fronts you may show. We go over all the possible blitz situations. If we play on Saturday, we will go out in light gear on Friday. We have our helmets and thigh boards on. I do

 





Page 131

not make our players wear knee braces on Friday. We are out for about one hour and 15 minutes. It is basically a mix-it-up day. We do a little of everything. We may be on the goal line 10 minutes or 15 minutes, depending on what we feel we need to work on.

Next, I want to show you a couple of sheets that we keep during the week in practice. It will not mean a lot to you, but they are sheets that you may want to develop. At the top of the sheet is "Mt. Carmel Running Game Tally Sheet." Along the top are all the formations that we use. Along the side are the even-numbered running plays and another list of the odd-numbered running plays. A lot of this is the same play but with different blocking schemes. In August and during the season, we have kids that keep a chart and tally the plays that we run. They tally those up so we know when we get into a game how many times we have run a particular play in practice. If we say that 32 and 33 are going to be big plays for us this week, we better make sure we are running enough of those plays in practice. We do the exact same thing with the passing game. You can develop your own chart or tally sheets. This is something I had my wife put together on the computer. We list all of our formations that we will use. Then we list all of our plays down the list. We have one area where we keep special down-and distance plays. We do not use all of our plays every week, but we have them listed. You can develop your own sheet to meet your need. One sheet is for the running game and one for the passing game.

Men, I am going to be here all night. If you want to sit down and talk about the things we do, I will be glad to visit with you. I am going to go very quickly on some of the things we do. Then I will let you see it on a videotape. I will cover the X's and O's with you later. I want to talk about our 36 and 37 outside-veer play. As you can see, we have one read, and we are going to react to the defensive back on the outside. If the linebacker scrapes, he will react to the linebacker. We teach the quarterback to cut up underneath the linebacker if he scrapes outside.

36 OUTSIDE VEER4 CALL

36 OUTSIDE VEER5 CALL

36 OUTSIDE VEER40 CALL

I would like to have someone come up so I can demonstrate how we run the option. I ask the running back to put his bottom hand across the belt. When we want to hand the ball off, we want to pronate the thumb down so the top of the hand is up. Notice how the elbow comes up when we turn the thumb down. It gives us a better pocket. On the outside veer, the quarterback is going to open at 4 o'clock, cross over and shuffle, shuffle. Now, can I tell you to take one long and two short steps? No! You have to work that out depending on the size of your quarterback. It is an individual technique.

The quarterback wants to get the ball into the pocket of the running back. If we want to give the ball to the running back, we simply pull the back hand, press with the front hand, and continue on. If the quarterback wants to keep the ball, he must read the end.

 





Page 132

If the end attacks the mesh, the quarterback snaps the ball off at the elbow of the running back and tucks the ball under the chin. Now the quarterback is going to turn up the alley. He wants to run for a first down.

We used to teach the pitch with the thumbs down. We now teach the basketball pitch. It is a little thing, but if I get hit as I make the pitch in a basketball fashion, the ball goes up in the air. We have a chance to catch the pitch if it is in the air. If the ball is pitched with the thumb down, the ball is likely to go on the ground, and that is difficult to handle.

Those were finesse plays. If we want to run a power play, we can run what we call the same play with zing motion. We want to make sure we secure the linebacker or the B gap. We are still going to read the same man, but this gives us power at the point of attack.

36 OUTSIDE VEERZING MOTION

If we want to hand the ball to the lead back, it becomes an I formation iso play. Now the blocking back is up at the line of scrimmage, and my tailback is only four and one-half yards deep. We can move the Z back in motion, so we can pick up the linebacker in the C or B gap. If we want to give the ball to the wingback we call it 08.

08FAKE DIVE, ZING MOTION

If the defense sees the wideout coming in motion, they think it is the lead play again. This time we fake the dive and give the ball to the wingback. These are old wing-T sweep principles.

We are only pulling one guard instead of two, because the front-side guard has to block down or he is covered on the goal line. We want to go inside or outside. We are going to go where the defense is not. We tell our down defender to read the defense and replace him. Don't run away from him; replace him.

While the video is warming up, I want to leave you with this thought. This is something we teach the kids. Earl Nightingale said, "You are what you think about." I think he got it from Emerson, to tell you the truth. We added this to the quote: "You are what you think about and act upon!" It is important that we tell our kids that if they want to be a good athletes and students, they must do the things that will allow them to be successful in that particular area.

My time is up. I will be glad to spend time with you if you want. Thank you.

Hal Mumme

An Update on the New UK Offense

University Of Kentucky

Thank you. It is really good to be here today. It is an honor to get to speak at this great clinic. I hope our staff has had a chance to visit with you this week. I apologize that I have not been here for the whole clinic, and I know this is a big clinic for the state of Kentucky. My wife has cancer right now, and these were the only five days she was allowed to leave Valdosta, Georgia, to come to Lexington to look for a house. We have been house hunting the last four or five days. I am sure some of you can identify with that. The good thing is that we have found a house that we can buy, and we will be able to move in very soon. In the future, I intend to be at this clinic each year. Hopefully, our staff has gotten to know some of the coaches here.

I have spent a lot of my career as a high school football coach. That part of the game is really important to me. I hope it is something that carries over into our program at the University of Kentucky.

A few years ago a friend of mine by the name of Spike Dykes of Texas Tech came to play in our golf tournament at Valdosta State. We had a couple of good years at Valdosta State. We were talking with Spike, and he asked me what my ambitions were. I said, "I think I want to stay a head coach." A lot of Division II head coaches move up to become coordinators at a Division I school. I told Spike that I liked being the head coach and that I liked being the boss. I guess that was the basic reason. He asked me what I thought my next step would be in the coaching profession. I said, "Well, my last name is M-U-M-M-E, I coach at V-A-L-D-O-S-T-A State, and we play our games in a high school stadium. I have set my goals for the next job to be in a school where everyone would know where we were talking about without having to spell it out. It is hard enough with a name like Mumme to communicate. You pick up the phone and say, 'This is Hal Mumme from Valdosta State.' You have to spell everything in the sentence for them." So I told Spike Dykes that I wanted to coach someplace where the school owned their own stadium and when you said the school, everyone would know where you were. Then all I would have to do would be to spell my last name. I guess the good Lord took care of us. He fulfilled my dreams with the Kentucky job. It is great to be in the state and in the SEC.

My topic today is supposed to be "An Update on University of Kentucky Football." I have only been here for two and a half months, so I do not have a lot to say about that. I know we have not had a winning season in eight years. I know we have a great quarterback. If he can overcome my coaching the next few years, he probably will be one of the best in the nation. We have a long way to go in terms of the rest of the positions. However, here are some things that may be of interest to you. After that, I will talk about some offense. That is what I like to talk about. Then I will give you a chance to ask questions about what we are going to do. Also, I will show a highlight video at the end of the talk.

I do not think the job at the University of Kentucky is any different from any other jobs that I have had as the head coach. The head coach is in charge of these things. He must have complete vision. What I mean by that is this: You must be able to visualize what you want the program to look like. This carries down to your staff. Your defensive coordinator must visualize what the defense looks like. You must visualize what it looks like in every situation. You must visualize what it looks like when you play an option team, what it looks like when you play a passing team, what it looks like at its inception. You have to visualize what it will look like at the start of the season and in the off-season as you group the players by position and into units. As you go through the spring, you must visualize what the team is supposed to look like at the end of spring. Next year, the high schools of Kentucky will be able to have spring practice, and you will be able to visualize what your players are doing. I think that will help the game in Kentucky. But the head coach must be able to totally visualize the situations.

As he gets into the season and into game planning, he must have a complete vision of what that defense looks like on 1st and 10, 2nd and short, or 3rd and long. If he can't do that, he is in trouble. If he has to go to a play book, it will be a tough year. If you go to your defensive coordinator and ask him what he is going to do on 3rd and 10 against North Alabama and he can't tell you, then he is not ready to be your defensive coordinator.

The best thing I can tell the young coaches here today is this: You must study the game. You cannot have a good vision of what things should look like until you study the game. It is great that you are here at this clinic. It is great that you go visit colleges. At UK we will be open to the coaches, and you can come anytime you want to. We are going to have a totally open-door policy. I think you should come to see us, but I think you should go other places as well. You need to spend a lot of time educating yourself on your particular aspect of the game. As this carries over to the head coach, he must be able to do all of these things.

The head coach must have a vision of what his offense is going to look like, what his defense is going to look like, and what his special teams are going to look like. That is the game. Then you get into other aspects of the game. How are you going to handle academics? How are you going to handle discipline? What are the boundaries that you are going to draw?

One of the problems we are having to deal with is this: There are no hard lines for our young people. Everything is a fine line or a gray area. There is not much right or wrong anymore. At UK we have some ideas about discipline. We are not going to let our players cross the boundaries. Now, that does not mean that we have to be very regimented. We are not a very regimented staff, and we do not run a very regimented program. We are going to have a lot of discipline. There are certain things they will not be allowed to do. If you steal, you cannot play for the Cats. If you do drugs, you cannot play for the Cats. If you beat up on your wife or girlfriend, you cannot play for the Cats. There are some other items that I deal with concerning our players. The point I want to make is that I have the process all thought out. I can walk through the office door and sit at that desk and wait for the next problem to happen. If I am in the office 150 days, I can promise you there will be at least 149 days when there is a problem ringing on the other end of that phone. That is what head coaches must be able to do-handle problems. If you do not have a concrete plan about your discipline, when the phone rings, you are grasping for straws. You are not sure how to handle the situation. If you have thought all of this out ahead of time, all you have to do is to make the decisions and to solve the problems on the other end of the phone. It is not always discipline. It could be academics, boosters, fund-raising, budgets, and other things. If you are going to be the head coach, you must have an idea what you are going to do about this. What are you going to do in the off-season? Who is going to be in charge of that part of the program? How are you going to handle it, and how are you going to approach it? When are you going to have spring practice? If you want to be a head coach, you must have a clear vision about all of those aspects. When those problems walk through your door every day, you do not have to dream up a new way of dealing with the problems.

The best thing I can tell you about the update of UK football is that we do have those things covered. We do not have a lot of players, so to speak. We do have a tremendous schedule. We do have a lot of enthusiasm about recruiting in Kentucky and every area that we can. We are going to recruit the southwest part of Ohio and the state of Kentucky as one area. One of our assistants will have that area, and he will cover every school in that area. We will know where every player is from the ninth grade up in that area. That is our goal over the next two years.

From there we are going to position-recruit in Texas, Georgia, Florida, New Jersey, and Samoa. Some of you may laugh when we say Samoa. We have had a player from Samoa every year. We were late this year and did not get a player from there. We will go any place we have to go to recruit. We feel we have great ties in these areas. I will send the position coach to those areas to recruit those players. If it is an offensive lineman, I will send Coach Guy Morriss, our offensive line coach. That is my vision of how to recruit. If we can convince the people in the area of southwest Ohio

 





Page 135

and Kentucky so that each year we can get between 7 and 15 players, that will be about 50 percent of our scholarships. If we can get the best players from this area who can play in the SEC, we have a big head start.

The reason I like to recruit this way is because of what I have experienced over the years. A lot of you have had great players who go on to college football and just seem to get lost in the shuffle. Here is what happens. You send a linebacker coach to Texas, and he recruits an offensive lineman. What happens to the kid from Texas? The kid is 17 years old and is a senior in high school. The linebacker coach is 40 years old. The two develop a close relationship over the 11 or 12 months of the recruiting period. The coach convinces the player how good he is. He spends a lot of time either calling him, writing him, or seeing him. He convinces him to come to UK, or Tennessee, or wherever. They develop a close relationship. The player signs. Then comes August 5, and the season comes around. He is an offensive lineman. He comes to the campus, and who does he deal with when he gets there? He deals with the offensive linemen and the offensive line coach. That is who he spends about 17 of the 20 hours per week that we are allowed to work with them. When is he ever going to see the linebacker coach who signed him? Hardly ever. If the player is on the scout team, the coach may see him. When do they ever talk or visit? We do not want that to happen to our players. We are not going to recruit that way. If we can recruit in this area and get to know the players over a period of years at camps, then we will sign them. But we are going to send the position coach to recruit the players.

You see kids all of the time who get caught in staff politics and do not make it. Now, if one of our coaches tells me that he does not like a player, I can tell him it is his fault because he recruited him. I can tell him to get down there and start liking him. They are not excused. This eliminates a lot of problems. This is what I am talking about: having a vision about what you are doing.

You must have a vision of how you are going to accomplish a set of objectives. Our set of objectives at the University Of Kentucky is to win the SEC. I mean in 
football. 
I wanted to say that so that everyone would know what I was saying. I love Rick Pitino. I think he does a great job. I had a great week with him this past week. I went with him to play Alabama. He is one hell of a coach and a good guy. We want to win in football. His program is the one we would like to emulate.

That is my idea of where we are as far as an update on Kentucky football. We have to recruit some more players. We do have a vision, and we do have a plan. We want all of you to get involved in the plan. We have a JV program for our walk-on players. That is the way we are going to handle that situation. Ever since the NCAA started the gender equity plan, they said we could only bring in 105 players to two-a-day practices. Well, 85 of those players are scholarship players. That means you only have 20 walk-ons. In this area, I will promise you, there are more than 20 players who want to walk on at UK. Coach Hatcher is here today. He has an office full of tapes of players who want to walk on. At this point, we have about 100 who have indicated that they want to walk on.

Each year we can invite 20 players to walk on. If we have 70 to 80 players who want to walk on, then we make 50 to 60 players mad. What we are going to do is this. We are not going to bring any of them. If they are walk-ons, they come when school starts. They will play a JV schedule. This may sound old-fashioned, because most teams do not do this anymore except service academies. We are going to play a four-game JV schedule. Those players will not practice with the varsity. We have a staff made up of GAs and student coaches. By doing this, they will get looked at. They will play Hargrave Military Academy, Georgia Military, and Middle Georgia College. Also, Campbellsville College JVs have agreed to play us. We are going to play a four-game schedule with those walk-ons in October. Instead of only bringing 20 in August, we can bring them all out when school starts.

Walk-ons do three things in Division I football. They sit on one knee and eat a lot of ice, then they get unhappy, then they quit. That is about it. They do not really get looked at. It is hard to show what they can do when all they do is run scout-team plays. They get tired of

 





Page 136

being yelled at by a 40-year-old coach holding up a card and telling them to ''run this play.'' That is not much of a tryout or a look. By having a JV program, we feel we can develop some talent. We can bring them in, set them aside, put them on another field, and let them learn our system. They will play the four games in October. At the end of that season, the JV coaches will make recommendations, and we will bring 25 to 30 up to the varsity level.

At that point, we have our 85 players practicing in the fall. Because we have low numbers of players, we have to use a lot of players who are twos to run the cardteam plays. Toward the end of the year, they are not enthusiastic about doing that. At the end of the season, those JVs are excited because they can show the varsity coaches what they can do. It is a good system. We used it for five years at Valdosta State and it helped us win a championship. This past season, our starting strong safety, our starting center, our punt-return man, and one of our key backup receivers were all scholarship players who were walk-ons when they were freshmen and had come up through the junior varsity. It allowed us to fill in those scholarships that we lose when we have to put someone off the team for discipline or a player does not make his grades. This gives us a pool of talent that we can draw from. We need the high school coaches here to help us on this. We can't go out and recruit walk-ons. You can tell your players that they will get a fair look at the University of Kentucky with our JV program if they want to walk on.

I want to show a video of our games last year so that you can see what we are doing on offense. We only have four running plays. The lead has always been the best running play for us. We like corner routes a lot, and we coach them a bunch. Notice that our offensive linemen are in a two-point stance a lot. I think you can see what we are doing. [Video]

Next, I want to talk about our offensive philosophy. We came up with this in 1986, when I was the head coach at Copperas Cove High School in Texas. We had 1500 students in our school. They had won 14 games in 10 years. The next smallest school that we had on our schedule had over 2000 students. We were outmanned. On top of that, all of our kids lived around Ft. Hood. At that time it was the largest military base in the free world. We would get the kids in the ninth grade on up. We came up with this philosophy. We had seen Brigham Young University use this system, and it worked. We felt if we could teach this to high school students, we could teach it to anyone. We did it as an experiment, and it worked out. We have been doing it ever since. Our one basic statement about our philosophy would be this: Throw the short pass as many times as possible to people who score.

In the three years at Copperas Cove, we won 14 games. We beat four schools that the school had never beaten. We made the kids and the community proud of the program. We did not win the championship, basically because we were outmanned. In three years we had one Division I football player to sign a scholarship. By comparison, most of the schools we played against signed four or five Division I players per year.

We told our players that we could not do a lot of things well. We were not very big, and we did not have a lot of numbers. We convinced our kids that we could do this: We could throw the ball better than anyone in the state of Texas. The kids got excited about it. We did everything we could to promote that concept. We did it over and over again in terms of promotion and talking about it. We tried to pick out of our younger grades the skilled people. You can find them if you will look.

When we were at Copperas Cove, we had to coach both sides of the ball. Mike Majors, who is our defensive coordinator, coached our offensive line at Copperas Cove. He helped develop a lot of this offense. We just talked about these skilled people all of the time. We wanted to know who the players were who came along who could score. Who were the guys who were coming along who had a knack for scoring?

We identified the players who we felt could score. Then we put them in a position to score. If you looked at what they were doing at BYU and what we had been doing as an I formation and option coach through the years in Texas, you could see the similarities. All we were ever trying to do was to take the kid who had a

 





Page 137

knack for scoring and put him in the tailback position. Then we want to get him some space to work in.

A lot of this thinking started a long time ago. When John McKay was at USC with O. J. Simpson at tailback, they would pull the linemen and run the student-body right sweep. Basically, what they were doing was to get their best back on the corner and have him stretch the play outside. He may stretch the play all the way to the sideline and go out of bounds. They would run the play over and over. Then suddenly he cut back and ran the ball into the end zone.

If you looked at the wishbone teams that Barry Switzer had at Oklahoma and Darrell Royal had at Texas in the 1960s, their object was to get the ball to one particular spot on the field with the pitch. They would arc-block with the lead back and be able to kick the ball out to the deep back. They knew they could score with the great backs that they had if they could get the back around the corner.

If the defense stretched outside, the fullback up the middle would score on you. Of course, they all had a quarterback who the defense had to take away. They were trying to get the football into the hands of the players who could score. They wanted to put them into space where they did not have to go over a pile in order to gain yardage or score. The people who were innovative on offense were doing that. They were trying to get the football to players who could score.

At West Texas State and at UTEP, we had done it like this. We had a nice little package that Grant Teaff and Bill Young had made popular at Baylor University. In those days, most people ran a 50 look. We ran the isolation with the wingback coming back in motion. We would run it and run it. After we set it up, we would reverse body-block, and the onside guard would pull and cut up on the free safety who was running in the alley.

A lot of people had the ideas of getting guys into space who could score touchdowns. The objective of offensive football is to score. We took the same idea and put it in at Copperas Cove. We decided that we would do all we could to put the ball in the hands of the people who could score and see what they could do. The formation we got into was this. We split both ends and had a wide slot to one side. We went from a split backfield set. Everyone liked to play cover three or cover one in those days. They wanted to leave seven in the box to stop the run. The teams we were playing were not gearing up to play us. They were getting ready to play the good teams. Those teams ran the ball out of two backs and two tight ends. We made them pay for not being ready to defend us. We would usually try to get the split end deep. We would look for a player who could catch the ball over his shoulders and the one who had the best speed on the team.

Mike Majors and I would sit in my little office and write all of the players' names down on a dry-marker board. I would get to make two picks for offense. I got to pick the quarterback and the split end. After that, Mike got 17 picks for defense. That is how we split our players up. I knew for us to have a chance to win, we had to be able to play defense. All of the good players who were average high school players ended up on defense. On offense we ended up with one fast man at the split end or X position. We did end up with a trigger man under center.

Let me show you how we lined up. We had an ex-tuba player at center. At the left guard, we had a player who was big. His name was Chester Jordan. When we got there, he was a ninth grader. He was 6' 4" and weighed 340 pounds. He could run the 40-yard dash in a day. He could bench-press the bar. When you take over a new job, you have some guys left from the previous staff. We would always ask them to tell us

 





Page 138

something positive about each player. At Copperas Cove we had 70 to 80 players that we asked about. No one had anything positive to say about Chester Jordan. He had duck feet, and they stuck out to the side when he walked down the hall. He had a big butt and duck feet. Finally, I asked the track coach about Chester. He said, "The best thing I can say about Chester is this. He was my manager for the track team last year. When we would go to track meets away from home, Chester could eat a whole loaf of bread and a jar of mayonnaise in one meal." We took him and started working with him because he was big. The good thing about Chester was the fact that you could not go around him very fast. For sure, you could not go through him.

At the halfback spots, we would have little players who were good athletes. They would try hard for you. On the outside, I would cheat on Coach Majors. I would not put the two wide receivers on the strong side on the board. I would get two basketball players and put them outside. I put them out wide because I knew they were not going to hit anyone. You could not wad them up and throw them on anyone. I would make a little deal with them. All during the football season they did not have to come to a certain part of the practice. They could go in the gym and work on basketball. I would let them go in the gym. Then during basketball season, two days a week they would come with me, and we worked on throwing and catching the football. We did that all year long, and the two got really good at the skills of the game. We only asked them to do a few things.

We would find a man at the wideout that could run the curl. The inside man would need to know how to run a flat and a wheel route. That is the way we set up our attack. We ended up leading the state of Texas in passing. We won some games that the school had not won before. The kids felt good about the program, and I moved on to a college job.

The thing that carried over was in keeping within the philosophy. At the split end, we had a man who could catch the ball over his shoulder. At the halfbacks, we had players who could catch the ball underneath. The left halfback may not always be the best runner, but he would be able to come out of the backfield and catch the ball. He knew how to get open when you played in the street. I always ask the kids this question: "If you were playing street ball, who would be the first man you would pick as your receiver?" It would always be the halfback. We would take that set and put our best athletes on the other side. We would teach them a couple of things. First, we would teach them what was covered and what was uncovered. In high school football, you can look out on the field a lot of times and find the defender covering the split end, who has his feet 10 yards from the line of scrimmage. To me, that is not coverage. We had a signal when we had that coverage. We would have the quarterback take the ball, even in the shotgun, and he would just rise up, throw the ball outside to the split end, and let him be one on one with that defender at 10 yards. We worked on the play and found out that the break point was about 7 yards deep. If the defender was at 7 yards, we had to start looking at the scouting report. If the defender was at 7 yards and really quick, you do not want to throw the ball to the split end. If the defender was on the slow side, we would do it. We got the quarterback and the split end to understand what was covered and what was not covered.

We were going to force teams to bring the corner up. Since that was our fastest man, if the defense brought the corner up too close, we would send the split end right on by him. We just started working on that play. If the defender came up really tight, we would run by him and throw the ball over the top. If the defender got in the 7-yard area and we did not think we could beat him with the quick pass, we would run him deep.

 





Page 139

If we did not think we could beat him deep, the quarterback would throw the ball behind the receiver. The quarterback would throw the ball a little flatter and over the receiver's shoulder. He did not want to throw the ball over the top of the defender. What we did was to force the defense to cover the split end tightly with the corner and safety. Most defenses wanted to play eight-man fronts. They wanted to play that safety man in the middle. When we got them to move the safety over on the split-end side, we had to be able to attack the slot side. Now they had the same problems on the slot side with the Z end. We were teaching him the same things.

After a few years, teams started working on the uncovered aspects of our offense. Then we started pulling linemen outside to block for the receivers. That got us to our quick-screen game. Every time we came to the line of scrimmage, the defense had to cover the X end, or the quarterback was going to get him the ball. If the defense covered him with two men, we would go to the Z receiver. If you did cover him with two defenders, we would go to Z. Soon we had two receivers covered by four defenders. If you start looking at your running game, you have to feel that is a good deal.

The coaches before we got there ran the I formation. They tried to run the ball between the tackles. The defense played them with an eight-man front. They could not block them because they were outnumbered. We wanted to get the advantage back on our side. If you will look at the thing, you can see what I am talking about. If the defense is covering the X and Z receivers with two men, then we are going to look at the Y man in the slot. If the defense did not put someone close to Y, we did the same thing with him. You could occupy the corner, and Y would have to work on the strong safety.

You can take a player who is not a tight end and play him at the Y. You can take a basketball player and play him there. You can do all kind of things with him. You can put him in motion and do a lot of other things. He can control the man on the running game. By using our philosophy to throw short and all of that, we have controlled five of the defenders.

It does not really matter how you line them up inside on defense. You have a chance to run the ball. You have a hat for their hat. If your players will get after them, you can run the football. We play little games with the defense over and over again. The thing that will happen is that you will get to guessing with them. You do not know when the defense is going to blitz or drop seven or what they will do. What we did was to take it out of the coach's hands and put it in the quarterback's hands. If the defense is guessing with me, he is in bad shape, because the quarterback is calling the plays. If the quarterback is calling the plays, he can see what is happening. As the game goes on, he knows what the defense is doing. Now the quarterback becomes a part of your offensive philosophy. He becomes a part of the rhythm of the game, so to speak. The quarterback can check plays a lot better than the coach. We were teaching the quarterback what we wanted. We wanted to give the quarterback enough freedom to call the plays at the line. We had to give him a system that was simple enough that he can change the plays with one word most of the time.

 





Page 140

This is how we taught the quarterback to do what we wanted. We took our starters and lined them up in the formation. We took all of the other players who thought they were quarterbacks and put them on defense. They were the Will, Mike, and Sam linebackers. We put the extra receivers out wide. All this for us is a walk-through. We put the ball in the quarterback's hands. I stood behind the offense where the quarterback could not see me. I would motion to one of the defenders to move. I would have one defender drop too deep or come up tight. The job of the quarterback was to give the one-word call and throw the ball to the right receiver. The next time, I would have the defense do something different. The quarterback had to react to the defense, make his call, and throw the ball to the right man. By the time we got to the end of the two-a-day practices, all of our quarterbacks knew how to locate the underneath defenders. As we got better at it, we would put a couple of defenders back deep as safeties. We were able to get them to locate the linebacker, corners, and safeties. If the quarterback can locate those seven defenders for you really quickly, it is easy to sort out the other four defenders. This was just a mental drill we did.

The other thing we had to do was this. We did not have fast people. After the receiver caught the pass, we had to do something to make sure we gained yards. If you were a running team and could average 5 yards per carry, I am sure you would feel good about it. This is what we told our wide receiver to do after he caught the short pass. We did not want him to duck and dodge or shake and bake. We wanted him to make 5 yards straight ahead. Then God would tell him where to go after that. The main emphasis was to catch the ball and get upfield. How do you teach this? This sounds easy to do, and everyone says that. But how do you do that day after day, week after week, so that it works? For warm-up, this is what we do. We got rid of the stretching. I wanted to practice two hours or less. I felt that was all we could get out of them. The players and parents loved this. I did not like the stretching drills when I played. Have you ever seen a dog get up off of the front porch and stretch before he chases a car? If he is going to chase a car, he is going to go chase the car. If you are going to play football, you come ready to play football. Football is not a sport where you need to do a lot of different things to train. The way to get ready to play football is to put on your equipment and go out and play football. We came up with this warmup drill. We are going to spend 10 to 15 minutes each day doing this drill. We are going to be warmed up. We are not going to be tight. We have a line just before they get to our practice field. When they cross the line, we let them know that they have come to practice. We are really serious about it. "Men, this is not softball practice." If you are a receiver, you come over and get in the receivers' line. We get the quarterbacks in another line. We give the quarterbacks the "drop of the day." It may be a five- or three-step drop. The quarterback works on his footwork on the lines. He takes the snap and comes back on the line. The receivers jog toward the dummies. They end up closer to one dummy than the other dummy. The quarterback throws the ball at the number opposite the dummy. The quarterback wants to keep the ball below the dummy. The drill represents what happens in a game. The dummy represents the linebackers. After the receiver catches the ball, we want him to turn and head straight upfield. It is a warm-up drill. He can jog straight up the field.

Now, we go back to our philosophy: Throw short as many times as possible to people who can score. We are trying to put X, Y, Z, H, and F in positions to score. We do two drills that we can do every day and not get bored. If you come to watch us practice, you will see that we have only four running plays and five passes, and we have our quick game, which I have described to you today. That is pretty much it, men. We have a zillion sets. We are going to use the one that puts our guys in the right position. We are going to put them in

 





Page 141

space where they can run straight upfield with it. When we get the defense spread out, we can run the football. That is why we have always had a 1000-yard rusher on our team. That is an overview of our offensive philosophy. That is kind of what we are about.

We are more comfortable in a 30-28 game than we are in a game that ends up 7-6. In all of the places that I have been, we have had to develop a mentality and a philosophy with our kids that did not destroy them when we gave up a touchdown. On defense we want to have 11 hats on the ball. That is really big for us. We run the pursuit drill endlessly. We will take speed over size. We will always take character over speed. We want 11 players who believe they can stop the opponent. You must have a philosophy for the entire game. In the SEC you are not going to play many 7-6 games. I did not coach in many of them at Iowa Wesleyan or Valdosta State. I was outnumbered at Copperas Cove, and I had to hope for the high-scoring games. We all have been on the sideline when we were involved in a tight game. When the opponents score a touchdown, you can just feel the wind go out of your team. The whole sideline is down. It has an effect on the offense and defense. We do not want that mentality. We want our offense to believe that we are going to score every time we have the football. Because of that, our defense can play as aggressively as they want. We want speed and aggressive football players.

Because we are a man-protection team and because we throw so much, we try to make all of our running game fit our pass protection. We can run the running plays that we use out of the two-point stance. That is where it starts. We want to create running lanes and throwing lanes. We have to be able to pass-block up front. Since we man-protect, we have to win the battle up front. When we have five of them who can win the battle up front, we have an offense. We work on this over and over in practice.

I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If you want to come to UK, remember, practice is open and our doors are open. It is a privilege to represent the commonwealth of Kentucky. Thank you very much.

The Eight-Man-Front Secondary Play

Ohio State University

Thank you. If you saw us play this year, you know that we had a great defense. We had some good players, and they were smart. They played hard. We had kids who understood the defense. There were two things that improved us to the status we had this year. We ended up in the top 10 of every defensive category there was. We finished number one in the country against the pass. We ended up fourth or fifth against the run. We had a good defense, and the credit goes to the players.

We had a pressure package. We weren't going to line up and play read defense. In our league, the average offensive lineman weighs about 310 pounds. We played with guys who were a whole lot smaller than that. We didn't want to get in a situation where we played a hit-and-read defense. If we had, we would have gotten mauled off the ball.

Our premise this year was to stop the run. We wanted to put people in passing situations so we could use our talent. We had two outstanding corners. We may have the first corner picked in the NFL draft, and he is only a junior. We basically told our corners to have a nice day on the outside. We were going to use the safeties to help stop the run.

We wanted to get people in a 2nd-and-long situation. To us, that is a 2nd and 8 or more. After we did, we were going to use a "zone dog." I believe in timing in the blitz. You have to be able to bluff and disguise the coverages and blitzes. We have to keep things simple, because of the 20-hour rule. When we go into a game, we are going to have basically two blitzes and two zone dogs for each front we play, plus our bluff scenario. When we get into the bluff game, it is important to understand the automatic system of the team you are playing. We want them to check off and take away what they are checking to.

With our defense, we play basically three fronts. We play a reduction, which we call "tight." We play this defense on 1st down and about 40 percent of the time. We have the ability to play two deep, a quarter scheme, and a weak zone from this defense.

We like to zone the formation in this defense. We call "tight 10 zone." We spoke our safety to wherever they run the ball. If the offense runs to the split end, we run sky support weak. The linebacker communicates that to the safeties. The down linemen play their gaps as they usually do. In this coverage, we pick up the extra player in the run game. We adjust to all sets to keep an extra man in the running scheme. In the Big Ten, the teams were not patient enough to throw the ball to the outside all the time. That is what we were giving up and forcing the offense to throw.

The next thing from this would be our man-free concept. We have the ability to show a sky-support defense and play man principles.

The second front we play about 25 percent of the time. We call it "slide." It is our stack package. There are three linebackers stacked off the ball. I was a linebacker coach for 12 years before I became the coordinator. Nine years ago, our defensive coordinator came in and wanted to play the Miami stack package, but he didn't coach the linebackers. We used to get our ass whipped with the tight zone cutback. We were asking a linebacker or safety to take an inside running gap. He had the ability to fall back into another zone. This year, we went to a 6 technique. We still played flow linebackers and quarter scheme and put the Leo end on the inside gap. That really helped our defense. We forced the ball to run east and west. We used our safeties for run support or robbers in pass coverage.

 





Page 143

The corners played inside out, man to man. That gave us nine people in the box.

The third defense, which we played about 25 percent, was the 46 defense. We have played this defense since 1983. The guy who this defense was named for, Doug Plank, helped us install it. We have pretty good input on what is going on in this defense. It was a double-eagle look. When we played this defense, it was probably our best defense statistically.

The key thing on this is that the linebacker coverage in the three defenses does not change whether you are playing man or zone. The secondary does not change in the three defenses. We are playing different fronts, but we are playing the same coverages with all the fronts. That cuts down your teaching. A lot of people wanted to know how we improved this year. I think we have a great defensive staff. We had a good understanding of what we were trying to accomplish. The thing we improved the most was stopping the big play. We consider a run over 10 yards and a pass over 15 yards a big play. Our opponents had only 23 running plays over 10 yards in an 11-game season. Out of the 23 runs, 6 of them were reverses. Of the other 17, about half of them were missed tackles. The year before, we had 93 runs over 10 yards. The reason for that was we took away one of the bubbles in our stack defense, and we started using our safeties in our run defense. When I talk about the bubble, I'm talking about playing a 6 technique over the tight end instead of a 9 technique.

We studied our films and found that most of the big plays came from lack of tackling. Over the last 10 years, the big fad has been stripping the football. We work the crap out of that. I'm not sure that we took away from our kids the ideas of tackling. From the first day of spring ball, we practice tackling every day that we are in pads. If we met on the practice field, as long as we had head gear on, we practiced tackling. We became a much better tackling team this year.

The third thing we did was work on an attitude principle. Attitude means a lot of different things. The first thing we wanted was to be tough. We wanted to be the "get after 'em" team, the hustle guys, and the hitting team. I think the big thing was the way we handled the mental things on the sideline. If we had a mental mistake or a physical screwup, we didn't jump their asses when they came off the field. We had a "so what" attitude. We felt that the next play was the most important one. We can't do anything about the other play. We said, "Let's go back and play some more defense.'' We gave all of our kids silver bullets. They were empty of course. That was our motto. We wanted silver bullets flying to the ball. The big deal was that the most important play is the next play. Play the play you are playing hard. Play with great physical effort. If you don't make the play, hell with it. Get ready for the next one.

We tried to get our safeties involved in rundowns. When we called our tight front, we checked the coverage to the formation they come out in. We call defenses by the personnel that the offense puts out on the field.

I'm going to show you our tight 10 zone. This is our huddle call and our automatic system. A lot of communication goes on in our huddle system. The Willie linebacker is checking the opposite sideline and trying to call out the different personnel groups that are coming on the field from the opponent's bench. He would call out "snake." To us, that means two tight ends and one back. If he called "viper," that would be three wideouts and one back. Those are examples of our terminology. The linebacker who calls the defense knows who is in the game, and that helps him make the calls.

If the offense comes out in regular personnel, he makes a left call. When he said "left," that aligned our defensive line. The bubble goes to the call side. Our nose guard is in a 1 technique to the tight end. The defensive end is in a 5 technique. To the weak side the tackle is in the 3 technique, and the Leo is in a 5

 





Page 144

technique. The Willie linebacker is in a 9 technique on the tight end. The Mike, or bubble, linebacker is in the 3 technique. The Buck, or stack, linebacker is in a 2 technique to the weak side.

If we are playing a team that is a pro-set, split-end-oriented team, we adjust the secondary. The secondary starts off showing a shell, or disguised defense. We give our secondary people a lot of freedom in moving around. Prior to the snap of the ball, the right safety yells, "Sky, sky, sky," and moves into a sky-support position. He does that for the front people. The backside safety is yelling, "Backer, backer, backer," and is moving into the middle of the formation. That is for the backside linebacker.

The Buck linebacker knows there is a weak zone his way. Any time we call this defense, we play the run and react to the pass. If the Buck linebacker gets any kind of flow to the split-end side, he fills the A gap inside out. If he gets a lead blocker coming in on him, he spills it outside. The right safety will be the unblocked player. He is the fill player. The Mike linebacker is a backside hip-stack player, and the Willie linebacker will fold.

If a pass shows, we play curl-hash marks with our outside people. The Buck and Mike linebackers play the inside hooks. We have a post player in the safety, and the corners are playing a loose man coverage on the wide receivers.

If a team comes out in a twins set, that is an identity in itself, and we go to an automatic cover three. We brought our corners over with the wide receivers. Whether the field or boundary corner aligns inside depends upon the receivers. We had a kid named Shawn Springs. He always gets the best receiver. That is more teaching for the corners, but it is setting up the blitz package.

If the team came out in a weak or tilted set, we go to an automatic "sky weak" call. That is the first adjustment I showed you. It is the zone weak. That is the same defense that is pictured in diagram 4.

If a team came out in a strong set, it is an automatic call. We can go to a "sky strong" call, which is like the weak call except it is to the strong side. We also have the ability to use the term "buzz." That puts the strong safety in a linebacker position. Buzz meant we were going to have support to that side of the field. To the boundary, we have linebacker support. The free safety was the post player. In buzz, the Willie linebacker is the outside dropper in pass and leverages all inside-out blocks. He turns everything back inside to the strong safety, who is unblocked. That gave us two ways to play the defense. Our strong safety against Notre Dame made 19 tackles. We held them to about 40 yards rushing, and they are a big-time rushing team.

If a team plays two tight ends and two backs and puts their flanker to the defenses left, we would make a left call.

 





Page 145

We play 1, 5, and 9 technique to the left. To the right, we play the tackle in a 3 and the Leo in a 6 technique. The bubble linebacker is left, and the stack linebacker is right. The corner takes the flanker to the left side. To the back side, the strong safety moves up into a monster position, and the corner plays back on the second tight end in a safety position. We play a read support on the back side. We are in an eight-man front with everyone gapped up. The linebackers are fast-flowing.

If the offense came out with both the tight ends on the same side in a wing set and a split end on the back side, nothing changed. The call was still "left." We left our corner on that side with the wing. We played a read scheme to the wing and a sky call to the split end.

The next look we got predominant in the Big Ten was what we called "snake." That was two tight ends and one back. When we get this set, we make a stud call. What that meant was to study your formations. When they do this, they generally run to one of those tight ends and throw to the other. It might be the same guy, but normally it isn't. Normally, they have a big-ass blocking tight end and a little pass-receiving tight end. We set our linebacker on the running tight end and the safety aligned on the pass-receiving tight end. If the run tight end was left, our linebacker would make a left call.

The Willie linebacker will align on the blocking tight end and make a stud left call. The safeties balance opposite Willie linebacker. We are back into an eight-man front. We take away the tight zone play and plays of that nature.

Let me get into the man principles from this defense. This is something we did this year that was new for us. I went to visit with the 49ers last year. This is something they did that really helped us in our running-game defense. We could call this defense in all downs and distances. It ended up being a man-free defense with a four-man rush. Also, one of the linebackers would end up being a hole or half player. We got good mileage out of this defense against all situations. We called it "tight scarlet key." It has the same principles as the tight zone. Before, we were going to zone, whatever formation the offense would come out in. Now we are going to man all formations.

If the offense comes out in one tight end, two backs, and two wide receivers, the linemen do not change. We could change the linemen's gaps with line calls. But as a base defense, the line stays the same. We let our kids move around in the defense. But they must be smart enough to know that when the ball is snapped, they have to be in position. The Willie linebacker can move outside, inside, wide, or tight, but when the ball is snapped, he attacks the tight end with an outside-in attitude. He is predominant a pass player. He is playing man coverage on the tight end with an outside-in attitude. It is a very easy read for him. There are only two blocking schemes that he has to defend. The first is the tight end attacking him. If that happens, he punches and gets his hat to the outside in the D-gap area. If the tight end blocks down on a low hat release,

 





Page 146

he closes down and spills all blocks outside. Since he is charging from the outside, the only release that the tight end has is an inside release. If that happens, he jams him, reverses his hips, and gets to an inside-out trail position on the tight end.

In the straight I formation, the Mike and Buck linebackers key the fullback. We are showing a twodeep or quarter-shell coverage. The offense doesn't know which way the safeties are going. The safeties key the tailback. If the fullback takes on the Mike linebacker, Mike takes him on in the B gap with an inside-out charge. The Buck linebacker flows to the inside hip of Mike. If pass comes, he is the hole player on the inside. If run comes, he is the cutback player. The same thing would happen if the fullback attacked the Buck linebacker. Mike now would be the cutback player and inside hole player on the pass.

Both safeties key the tailback. If he goes left, the right safety goes to the post, and the left safety comes to support. The offense didn't know which side we were spooking to, and we always had the extra player on flow. The hardest thing to teach and get accomplished is the linebackers overrunning the ball on the cutback. It is a sound defense against the option. The support safety is the pitch player, and the post safetyafter he checks the postis the alley player.

If the offense comes out in a twins set, it is an identify in itself. We play it just like the last coverage. The linebackers key the fullback. The two safeties key the tailback. The Willie linebacker has the tight end. The problem is whether the Willie linebacker can cover the tight end. We did it this year. The kid we had doing it was not a great athlete but a smart kid and knew the difference between a high-hat release and a block release. He has help from the linebacker in the hole and the free safety.

If a team came out in a pro set with the tailback set in the weak halfback position, we made adjustments to that. We taught that the offset back is the most dangerous pass receiver. Basically, we are in sky support to the right, the difference being that the safety is man on the offset back. The Buck and Mike linebackers are on the remaining back.

If the offense came out in a pro set with the strong set, we would play it exactly like the weak set. The only difference is that we would never buzz in the scarlet key. The right safety takes the strong back, and the left safety is free.

 





Page 147

If the offense comes out with a twin set and breaks the tailback into a wide-receiver position away from the set, the strong safety takes the break. The corners take the wide receivers. The free safety is free in the middle. The Mike and Buck linebackers take the remaining back.

If they came out in what we called a buckeye set, which is a three-wide-receivers set, we made another adjustment. We put both corners on the wide receivers and the strong safety on the third receiver. The free safety was in the middle. We gave them a three-deep look. If we played a team that played a lot of this type of personnel grouping, we would pull our strong safety out of the game and put in another corner. If the third receiver is a tight-end split-out, we would leave the strong safety in the game. We pulled the Willie linebacker off the line and put him in a stack position behind the defensive end. The linebacker makes a trio call. All linebackers are in stack positions. The three linebackers are playing trio coverage on the two remaining backs. The linebackers are fast-flowing. If there is action toward Willie linebacker, he is in an outside-in attitude. The Mike linebacker blows the B gap to the Willie side. The Buck linebacker blows the A gap away from the Willie linebacker. On action the other way, the Buck linebacker is in the stack. The Mike linebacker blows the A gap, and Willie hangs back for the cutback. That particular defense helped us a lot against both run teams and pass teams.

Any time a team took the tight end out of the game, we came after the quarterback. We felt that they had shortened the distance to the quarterback.

Against snake, the two tights and one back, we want our Willie linebacker on the worst pass-receiving tight end. The call linebacker makes the call to the Willie, and Willie makes the stud call. The free safety kicks the other way, and the remaining back is taken by the Mike and Buck linebackers. We are gap-sound against the run, sound against pass, and in an excellent position on all option games.

If the offense comes out in con grouping, two tight ends and two running backs, they are doing it for a reason. Very few teams come out in this set to throw the ball. We make one of three calls. We play tight defense, Bear, or Ohio, or we substitute in the defense. The coverage will be 10 zone or man free. They are going to try to play smash mouth with us. We want to get people in gaps and people running downhill at them. When we played scarlet key coverage against the con, we matched the strong safety up on the second pass-receiving tight end. The free safety and boundary corner keyed the tailback. Mike and Buck took the fullback.

If we played our Ohio or 46 defense against the con package, we would give a left or right call to get our personnel in the proper places. We put the boundary-side corner and the free safety in the safety positions and backed them off the ball. They keyed the tailback. The Mike linebacker had the fullback. The strong safety and Buck had coverage on the two tight ends. The strong safety handled all breaks in the formation, and the Buck linebacker handled all tight-end adjustments.

We have a dog call that we worked with our scarlet key. We game-planned what we were going to do. If the offense was a straight I formation, the dog call tells us that one of our linebackers is blitzing. We don't know which linebacker it is going to be until they show

 





Page 148

us what the formation is. We had to know whether they ran the ball toward the tight end or split end. Everything we did was designed to stop the run. If they were a tight-end-running team, we blitzed the Mike linebacker through the B gap from a depth of about 2.5 to 3 yards. If he got action his way, he spilled everything outside, and the unblocked player to that side was the strong safety. Both safeties in the scarlet key are reading the tailback, so they are on the move with the tailback.

If the team is a split-end-running team, we bring the A gap player. In that case, the Buck linebacker comes through the A gap and spills everything to the safety moving with the tailback. The other linebacker was the cover linebacker, playing behind the hip of the blitzer, never overrunning the ball. Because the safeties were keyed to the tailback, you always had a player to spill the ball to. We could be super-aggressive.

We played the scarlet key on the strong and weak halfback sets with our safeties. The safety opposite the set back is the post player. The safety to the back took him in coverage or was a spill player for the blitz linebacker.

The other blitz came from a one-back set. In this set, since the Mike and Buck linebackers were both on the remaining back in our scarlet key, we called a ''flow dog." That meant that whichever way the back went was the linebacker who came. The other linebacker was the cover linebacker. It didn't matter where the wide receivers were.

Before I close, let me talk about the Ohio, 46, or Bear defense. I won't even put the corners in on this defense. Our free safety was our adjuster. This year when we run this defense, you will see him a little deeper. He is going to be 5 to 7 yards deep. The Willie linebacker and Leo are mirrored positions. They are coming off the edge against a straight I, aiming for the near hip of the fullback. If it is an offset I, they aim for the inside throat of the offset back.

The B gap players penetrate the line of scrimmage. We want them to key the ball, get their asses up in the air, and create some havoc in the backfield. They want to disrupt pulls and fold-blocking in the offensive line.

The noseguard is a backdoor player. He crowds and keys the ball. On the snap, he tries to drive his eyebrows through the center's throat. He tries to maintain inside leverage. If the center's helmet is trying to lead-block him, he tries to press him as deep into the backfield as possible and come off the back end of the center.

If we get all that done, we have two free football players plus a free safety in the hole. We call the adjuster that for a reason. He will handle all one-back breaks. He handles anything different in the formation. In a two-tight-ends and two-back set, he is the guy who walks up on the line of scrimmage. If they come up in a one-back set, the adjuster goes out and plays the coverage on the third receiver. The adjuster is a secondary player.

The Mike linebacker in the one-back set plays on the inside hip of the remaining back. He is a free football player on flow. There is no one who can get to the Mike linebacker, but he has the opposite A gap of the noseguard. If he gets flow, he is filling downhill. If the noseguard makes a mistake and gets across face on the center, the Mike linebacker may have to rock back and take the cutback.

The Willie and Leo coming off the edges have responsibility for bootleg and reverse. We tell them that if the tailback's shoulders are perpendicular to the line, there is no threat of cutback. They should slow down and check quarterback on the bootleg and split end on the reverse. If there is any threat of a cutback, they need to play that.

Scout Team Utilization

Buffalo High School, Wyoming

I consider it a privilege to be speaking here today. John Burke suggested that I tell you a little about my background. I have coached high school football for 10 years. I coached the defensive line for John Burke for four years at Douglas County High School in Castle Rock, Colorado. I coached the offensive line for Mike McCall for three years at Douglas County. For the past three years, I have coached at Buffalo High School in Buffalo, Wyoming. My primary responsibility is the scout team and the tight ends. As my résumé indicated, I started coaching a little late in life.

In Wyoming high school football, we have four classifications: 1A to 4A, with the largest being 4A. In 1995, Buffalo was the 2A runner-up and was state champ in 1996. Mike Moon is the head coach and does an outstanding job. This past year was his fourth state championship.

Buffalo High School is located, as you might guess, in Buffalo, Wyoming. It is located 430 miles north on I-25 where it ends. We are about 60 miles from the Montana state line. The population of Buffalo is about 3500, on a good day. As in most small towns, we have great community support for our athletic events. I am sure you have heard the standard joke: "If you want to rob a bank, do it on Friday night, because everyone will be at the football game." Actually, I do not think it would do you any good, because there is no money in the banks.

At Buffalo High School, we have 370 students. We have 60 to 65 kids out for football. We have about 40 on the varsity and 25 freshmen. There is another high school in our county. It is located 40 miles south of Buffalo. It is in Koycee. They have 85 students in their school. The WHSAA allows their kids who want to play football to travel to Buffalo to be a part of our team. We have about four kids who take advantage of this. They travel 80 miles to be on our team. We take 65 players to Black Hills State University in August for our four-a-day football camp. Black Hills State is located in Spearfish, South Dakota, and is about 150 miles east of Buffalo.

We do not platoon at Buffalo. Our average road game is over 200 miles one way. Because of the distance some of our kids have to travel, we have a strict two-hour limit on our practice schedules.

This is what our normal practice looks like. On Monday we talk and walk through our offensive and defensive game plan. We do some heavy conditioning as well. On Tuesday we work on team offense and scout-team defense. On Wednesday we work on team defense and scout-team offense.

On Thursday we do something a little different. Our kids come to practice at 6:30 in the morning. We practice one hour and fifteen minutes until 7:30 A.M. This practice is in helmets and shorts. We run through the offensive and defensive game plans and the kicking game. We feel this gives them extra time before the game. On road trips, we usually have to leave by 11 A.M. or 12 noon on Friday to be there in time for the games. Going in early on Thursday gives us some extra time.

Let's talk about the scout team. It is full of all kinds of surprises. You have to know when to chew them out, and you have to know when to say "nice job."

How many of you have seen the movie 
Rudy? 
Looks like about 25 percent. That is not bad, because the rest of my talk is based on the movie 
Rudy 
Three years ago, we went to Black Hills State for our camp. We stayed in a college dorm that had a TV lounge. One night we were in the TV lounge and the movie 
Rudy 
just happened to be on. Most of our kids watched the movie from start to finish. If you have not seen the movie, you should. It is a great training film, and it is a great

 





Page 150

story. It illustrates the role of the scout team and its players much better than I could explain it. Ever since that night, our scout team has been called the "Rudy team."

The movie is about a scout-team player at Notre Dame. I will try to explain a few points in the movie. This kid on the Notre Dame team was a scout-team player, and he got to dress for the final game of his senior year. In the movie, as the Notre Dame players went out of the locker room to the stadium, they would reach up and touch a sign that hung in the hall leading to the stadium: "Play like a champion today." I think it had the logo of a leprechaun on it. Every player who passed by the sign would reach up and touch it with one hand on the way to the field.

We are the Buffalo High School Bisons. We have a decal on our helmet with a buffalo on it. The day after we got back from camp that year, I noticed one of our decals over the door that leads out of our dressing room to our football field. Now when our kids go out to the field, they reach up with two hands and touch the buffalo on the way out, just as the Notre Dame players did in the movie. Of course, our players are a little smarter. They realized that two hands would be better than one.

Now, all of that may sound silly. But wait until you see our scrimmage vest. [Yellow scrimmage vest with "Rudy" painted on it displayed.]

While the scout team is a tough job, we do not candy-coat it or blow smoke. We try to tell it like it is. We want to have fun, but we want to stay focused. This is what we want to accomplish. (1) Show outstanding effort and attitude in duplicating opponents' plays. (2) Your job is to make the first team better. (3) The better you make them, the more playing time you get. (4) Our secret goal is to score on the first team.

We try to sell our kids on being Rudys. I do not know whether we sold it to them or they bought into it or a little of both, but being Rudy is a big part of our team. Believe it or not, when Coach Moon says that it is time to scrimmageand those of you who have not seen the film 
Rudy 
will not understand thiswe have four or five chants of "Rudy, Rudy, Rudy." They start chanting from four or five places on the field. In the movie, that is what happened. On the last play of the year, the scout-team player named Rudy got into a Notre Dame game.

We do not sugar-coat the scout team. We tell them what our goal is. We want an outstanding effort and attitude in duplicating the opponent's plays. Notice, we added 
attitude 
in there. On Tuesday we get in the huddle, and the first thing I tell them is this: "Your job is to make the first team better. That is your job. That is what you are here for." On Wednesday we tell them again, "The better you make the first team, the more playing time you are going to get." I tell them this in the huddle. Again, our secret goal is to score on the first team.

This Rudy deal has been going on for three years. Our kids know that being a Rudy is being part of the team. That goes with the territory. We tried something new this year that worked out really well. When our freshman team completed its season, we still had three or four varsity games left. This year, the freshman coach picked five players from his team to be Rudys for the rest of the season for the varsity. Freshmen cannot play varsity at our school. However, they can play on scout teams. This is voluntary, because it extends the freshman season. So far no one has refused it; in fact, they consider it an honor.

As the scout team coach, I try to be as positive as I can. In fact, it gets a little sickening at times. But when my 5' 9", 120-pound tackle comes back to the huddle looking through the ear hole of his helmet, it is not going to do me any good to chew him out. My big job is to convince him that we are having fun. Sometimes that gets tough to do.

Generally speaking, Buffalo High School gives no individual awards. We do not have a "Most Valuable Player" award or anything like that. However, two years ago, we changed that. I am sure that all of us have had teams where we had seniors who have been on the team for four years and have never missed a practice and, more than likely, have never been late for practice. When the Rudys huddle up, they are usually

 





Page 151

first in the huddle, but the only time they get to play is when we are way ahead or way behind. But he loves the game, and he loves being part of the team. He is a true Rudy. Now we give a coaches' award to this type of kid. We do not give the award every year. The kid has to be a true Rudy. Attitude of senior leadership is critical to their success.

The movie 
Rudy 
illustrates to the senior leaders the value of Rudys much better than I could. This is what we stress to our seniors. For the program to be a success, they must understand the role of Rudys. I refer to the move as a training film. (1) Attitude of senior leadership is critical to their success. (2) They need to understand the purpose and values of Rudys. (3) They should receive recognition by the first team: "Good job, Rudys." (4) Senior leadership takes part of the Rudys for the second team.

I am always positive. If we gain 1 or 2 yards, we are giving them high fives just as if we scored a touchdown. Now, I am telling them "good job" and how much fun we are having.

How do we accomplish all of this? First, we have computerized our scouting information on each team we play. If you are like most schools, you have a four-drawer file, with one or two of those drawers crammed full of scouting information. What we did was to go into those drawers and copy three years of data on a disk on each team. We copy four categories. It is a very unsophisticated system; it is strictly a storage system. We copied only four areas: our defensive game plan, your offensive tendencies, your defensive tendencies, and 10 to 12 of your offensive plays. When you put that on a computer and print it out, you come out with about 20 pages. Last year, when we played a team, we went through these four categories and put them on the computer. That becomes our current scouting report.

We do all of our scouting from videotape. We are so far from our opponents. When we go through the tapes to scout you, we prepare another game plan. We have a defensive game plan, and we identify your offensive tendencies, defensive tendencies, and your best 10 to 12 offensive plays. We compare them to what we just printed out. We put the latest report on the computer and develop a current game plan. Then everything slides down another year.

The goal is to be able to find this information fast. Before, when we went to the filing cabinet, we could never find what we were looking for. Now we know where everything is located. We print out the four categories, and we are ready to go practice.

I have found that most head coaches do not like to throw away anything. Our plan is to keep three years of data. It does not matter how many years of data we keep, we probably will not refer to it unless someone says something like this: "Didn't they run something special three years ago that we need to be aware of?" Then we can go back to the computer and look at the past scouting reports. We may not print it out, because we most likely will just look at the film of this year's team, print out the scouting report from the past year, and then create a package that we can take out on the field.

The package we take out on the field looks like this. I have each play that I want the scout team to run that day on a printout. All assignments are drawn out. That is what I take into the huddle. It takes me about five minutes to print these plays out. It does not matter whether the plays get wet, torn, dirty, or whatever, because I can duplicate them instantly on the computer.

Here is a sample of one of the scout-team plays. These play sheets are numbered and match an index card created by the defensive coordinator. I look at the films and determine some of your blocking schemes. I make sure to draw out each assignment. You must remember

 





Page 152

that we are dealing with young and, most of the time, inexperienced players. I create the package with blocking schemes on it. I take the plays in the huddle. We try to put as much info on the sheets as we possibly can. Again, we are dealing with young players.

Our defensive coordinator creates his index cards to match these plays included in the package. We have them numbered so they correspond. We have the play number, description of the play, the defense we will use, and special notes on who to watch. He has the list prepared and gives it to me. I start down through the list, running the plays. Occasionally, our defense will not do well on, say, play number 6. He will come back to me and say, "In two plays, run play 6 again." We want to make sure that the defense knows what they are doing.

We play a 50 defense. It is very easy to put in the blocking schemes for the scout team. Our goal is to put as much information on these as possible. I have discovered in dealing with the Rudys that I get a better job if I put the blocking schemes on my play sheets. We want to be as effective as possible. We want to accomplish four things. (1) We do not want to waste time in the huddle. (2) We do not want the first team waiting on the Rudys. (3) We do not break the huddle until the first team is ready. (4) If we wait at the line of scrimmage for longer than 10 seconds, we huddle again. We want to communicate as quickly as possible.

We do some things on the scout-team plays to help communicate with the players. If we pull a man, we draw the path for the pulling man in red. Now there is no excuse for the guard not to know he is pulling. For the ball carrier, we indicate with a heavy black circle and a heavy black line the path he is to run. We try to give our quarterback some key information on the fake or action he will employ. For us, a blue line indicates a pass or pitch. Now, remember, this is not ours; it is our opponent's offense.

We line up the backs to indicate their alignment. I do not have to say anything in the huddle. I just hold up the sheet and then ask if there are any questions. If no questions, we can run the play. We make sure to give the direction that the quarterback comes out. We give the location of the slots and flankers. We make note of any fakes. Also, we indicate where the quarterback would call the snap count on motion plays. If we draw a receiver with a straight line and nothing at the end of the line, he is to run the corner or defender off. If the line has a line forming a T, he blocks. If a pass play is called and the man is covered, we still want the quarterback to throw the ball. Remember, the practice is for the defense, not for the offense. We have to explain that to the quarterbacks.

If we want to run an audible, we can. If we find that the defense is loading up on us, we can call the audible and run the dump pass to the tight end. We would call our live color, call "red 33" on the line, and run the pass play.

We have found that most teams run 60 percent of the same plays each year. We do not have to draw these plays up each year. We just use the same plays the next year.

We try to duplicate everything you do. We try to duplicate the huddle you use. If you are in two lines facing the line of scrimmage or if you huddle in a circle, we do that. The more I ask of the Rudys, the better they perform. They do not execute at 100 percent all of the time, but they try hard.

If you walk or run to the line of scrimmage, we try to duplicate that. We duplicate your line splits. If the linemen come up to the line of scrimmage and get down, we do the same. If they wait for the quarterback to call "down," we will give the same look. We can't always do it, but we try to duplicate the quarterback's cadence. If you like to run an audible in certain situations, we try to do it too. The big thing that this does is to allow us to be able to call a snap count on something other than one. Again, we are trying to make it as realistic as possible. You must remember that the attention span of the Rudys is not too long.

When the scout team goes to defense, our offensive guards make a call on every play. There are four calls for the guards. They are covered, uncovered, inside gap,

 





Page 153

and outside gap. If we are in the 50 defense, both guards would make an uncovered call. If the tackle kicks down and covers the backside guard, he makes a covered call. If the nose man is in the 1 gap, the guard to that side makes an inside-gap call. If the tackle on the back side is in the 3 technique, the guard to that side makes an outside-gap call. If the defense has 11 men on the line of scrimmage, hopefully the quarterback can see it, and we will do something different.

When the scout team is on defense, we try to give them as many combinations as we can on this. Both of our offensive guards make the calls on every play; it does not matter what the play is. The left guard may make a covered call, and the right guard may make an uncovered call. This identifies our blocking schemes on the line of scrimmage. Also, it indicates to the back the blocking scheme and where he should run. This helps us communicate with the players when we talk to them during the game. We want to duplicate as many looks as we can for our guards in practice. This includes the blitzes and stunts you might run. We huddle and call the defense. We try to duplicate everything as much as possible. We give the guards as many combinations as we possibly can. I am convinced that there are three things that a team needs to be successful. (1) You need good players. The more good players, the better. (2) All players need to be schooled in sound techniques and fundamentals that complement your offensive and defensive schemes. (3) You need team chemistry.

I believe that team chemistry exists when the players care about one another. In 1995, when we were state runners-up, we felt we had a better team talent-wise than we did in 1996, when we won the state championship. Our 1996 team drew a line in the sand and said, ''This is it. You are not going to pass our line." They did not let you past that line. I have spent a lot of time trying to figure this out. I have talked to Coach McCall about this a great deal. I think team chemistry is when the team truly cares about one another. Now, if that is a correct definition of team chemistry, what does a coach do to cause that to happen? I am not sure about that point, but I have thought about it a long time. I think that we as coaches must care about our kids if we want our kids to care about each other.

My time is up. I thank you for your attention. I hope your scout team has lots of Rudys.

Speed and Power Development

Baylor University

We have a new head football coach at Baylor. Dave Roberts is the new coach. Any time you have a new coach, you have a lot of things to go over. We are trying to get used to each other. We get there early and stay late. It has been a long winter season for us, and we start testing next week. Before I was at Baylor University, I was at Southern California for four years. Before that, I was an assistant at the University of Missouri for seven years. All of you Michigan fans will get to see us about the third game of the year. I know we will just be a scrimmage game for Michigan. I want to see if I can find Lloyd Carr and shake his hand now, because I know I will not be able to get to him after our game next fall. The players will carry him off the field, and I do not want to get into that.

The thing that I do when I go to clinics is this. I want to learn some things that will provoke me into thinking a little. Also, I want to learn some things that I can take back and put into our off-season program. Hopefully, I will be able to provide you with both of those things tonight.

The things I am going to talk about are things that I have learned from others. Just like you, as a coach I am going to visit with others, watch film, and break down workouts. I am going to learn from coaches around the nation who I think are smarter than I am in one way or the other. The material that I will present is not necessarily anything I have invented. It is material that I have learned from others. At times, I will refer to those coaches.

The first quote is from a book, 
Periodization of Strength 
by
Tudor Bompa. Tudor is one of the guys with an accent. If he is farther away from home than 100 miles and he has slides, that makes him an expert. Perhaps tonight I am an expert. I may sound like I have an accent to some of you. This is what Tudor said: "Flexibility can be improved day to day; strength, week to week; speed, month to month; work capacity, year

to year." Is that true? From what I am finding out by applying some principles, it is true. If you do the right thing flexibility-wise, you can be more flexible today than you were before. That is true the next day and the next day, next day and the next day. Can strength be improved week to week? Yes! It can if you do the right things from week to week. We all have experienced that.

Speed is month to month. That sounds a little tougher. Speed is tougher to improve. We used to start out by getting into an aerobic base. We would lift weights. After so many weeks, we would get into conditioning. Then we would worry about speed training. If speed is month to month, we had better start training on speed right from the get-go.

Michael Johnson is a graduate of Baylor University. He still comes down and trains. He is going to race Donavan Bailey this summer in June. It will be a 150-meter match race for a million dollars. After the Olympics, Michael took some time off. Then he did a lot of commercials, and then he started back in training. He did not start off by getting a base. He started on speed work first. The race is going to be a race to see who can run the 150 meters the fastest the most number of times.

So, speed is month to month, and it needs to be worked on from the very beginning in some way. We will get into that later.

Work capacity is year to year. Work capacity is fitness with the ability to handle the load that you are doing. It is the ability to handle practice. We see that each year with our players. The freshmen and sophomores are going through practice, and it is killing them. They may be going through the off-season drills, and they are crawling around as if they are dying. The seniors are cool. They want to know what is wrong with the

 





Page 155

young players. The seniors have four years of work capacity from the training program, and they know what to expect. The freshmen have never done the program before.

What we have found in our training is this. The foundation of all of our training is our work capacity and our fitness. This is also what the eastern groups believe. The more fit you are, the more work you can do. The more work you can do, the more quality work you can do. The more quality work you can do, the better you can be. This is true, even if it is only 2 percent per day. If it is 2 percent every day, then you are going to be better than the other guy.

Fitness is the basis of our program. It is the cornerstone of our program. That is what we work on first. You must have great fitness. It does not matter if it is weight fitness, conditioning fitness, running fitness, jumping fitness, speed fitness, or anything else. We are going to approach it from a standpoint of fitness first. After fitness comes strength, power, and then speed. Those are the three parts of our program from a weight-lifting type of program.

In our program, there are three more things involved. They are part of our cornerstone. We are going to train hard. We are going to take care of that in the weight room and with agilities. The coaches will take care of that on the football field.

We must eat right. Most of us are getting older. If you are like me, you have a problem buying clothes. Instead of buying clothes a little longer, we have to buy them wider. There are not enough hours in a day, if you do not eat right, to work it off or to work through it. You must eat right.

We must have rest to recover. That is a problem now. When we used to have athletic dorms, we could control what they ate and when they rested, and you could control the breakfast check as to when they got up. You can't do that anymore. Today, kids think that they can train really hard on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and then go out and go hard on Friday and Saturday nights. That does not work well on your body. The key is train right, eat right, and rest to recover. That is one thing that Michael Johnson does in his program. It makes a difference over the other athletes. When he was in high school, the best he ever finished was third in the state. He got into college 10 years ago, started training, and liked the program. He got into track and really liked what he was doing. Now he will not miss a workout. I bet he has not missed 50 workouts in the last 10 years.

Now, all of this is a nice theory. How do you apply it? Here is how we apply it. When we are training our people, we can do this. When we are lifting light weights, we can lift them very, very fast. It is like a snatch, clean, or jump. It is very fast. It is body weight. Next we go to power. Now there is more resistance, and we have to use more strength and movement. It is like a power clean or a jerk, or it could be a jump and holding a weight of some kind.

Next, we get into strength movements. They are very, very heavy and very slow. You have to train all up and down the continuum. When you first start out training when you are in high school and you start lifting heavy weights, you get better at everything. This includes speed, strength, and power. That is because you are not very strong. But after you have been lifting heavy weights for a few years, you do not learn as fast. You do not jump as fast because you spend too much time training at one end of the continuum.

You can see the speed of movement at the one end is very fast. Also, it is very long. It comes with long movement.

The next movement is more medium, and it is quick. It is like a clean. It is heavier, and the movement is not as long. It is a quicker movement.

 





Page 156

Strength movements can be short and slow. If you are maxing on a squat or squatting on a bench, it is very slow movement.

Next we get into some keys and some applications. In the off-season, what day are you the freshest? Monday! They had the whole weekend off. That is the day we are going to do our speed training. We are going to do some type of movement warm-up. We do a lot of different things in our warm-up. After that, we are going to do light, explosive things. We do hang snatches. This is how we teach hangs and snatches. We teach it backwards or from the top down. The first thing we teach is space. Then we teach from the hang, and then we teach it backwards.

What is our base? The easiest way to teach our kids is to jump three times and land in a breakdown position. That is the position they are going to hang-clean. All they are going to do is to jump with weight. Now they are ready to go. That is how they set their feet. That is the first clue: feet.

Our next clue is the knees. What do I mean by knees? The bend of the knees. How far? If there is a wall in front of me and my toes are touching the wall, then my knees touch the wall.

The next clue is the chest. I want to tighten my lats up and get a big chest. Now I have feet, knees, and chest.

The last clue is my wrist. I am going to turn my wrist over. There is a straight line down my wrist. Now I have feet, knees, chest, and wrist. We get our guys standing up tall, holding broomsticks. We are going to do two things, but one at a time. My guys can only do one thing at a time. When I ask them to remember two things at a time, that is when we start having problems. We remember one thing at a time. We are going to go feet, knees, chest, and wrist. Now we want them to bend over. Now jump. They will ask, "Do you mean off the ground?" Yes! That is a jump. It is feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, and jump. Everyone can do that because it is a very simple movement. That is great posture. Posture is a key in sports. You can't shoot a free throw without posture, and you can't squat without posture. You can't pitch without posture. You can't swing a bat without posture. You can't power-clean without posture. Feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, jump. Very good.

Now, let's do an upright row. They will keep the elbows down. I tell them to get the elbows up. It is elbows up, back under, up, back under. Now we have them put it together. Feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, jump. Good, you can clean. Let's go to a bar. It takes about that long. If you have 10 players, it takes a little longer. That is how we teach the clean. They can learn to clean in about one day.

We always go from the hang for about one month. After about two or three weeks of hang-clean, we will do hang-snatch. It is the same thing. The only difference is that we are going to have a wide grip. How wide? We have grooves on the bar, so we say get outside the bar. We adjust them as we go. We tell them to get outside the bar, and we coach them on the run. Again, feet, knees, chest, and wrist. Now, in the bend-over in the clean, I bend to here, and in the snatch I bend to here. [Demo] We just cover the bar more with the shoulders. It is feet, knees, wrist, chest, bend over, and now jump.

Now, it is feet, knees, chest, wrist, and upright rowing. This is hard for them. Football players tend to be weak back here and strong up here. They start to lift that broomstick, and they want to lift with the grip wide. No! A lot of them can't even do it with a wide grip. We want them to come back inside, then drop the elbows, and then push. Upright row, drop the elbows, and push. We always keep pressure on the bar. They think they can reach down and bring it straight up, but they end up on their back. We want them to drop the elbow and

 





Page 157

push. Finally, they will get it. Here we go. Feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, jump. Boom! Now you can snatch. It takes about that long to teach them. If we ever get messed up, we go back to our clues.

After three or four weeks of hang-cleaning and hang-snatching, we tell them to go off the floor. We never snatch off the floor. We just clean off the floor. That is how we teach clean and snatch.

Here is an example of a work week. Our warm-up is footwork, core work, pre-hab, and loosening up. Then we go to our workout.

On Monday it is a speed day. We are going to do plyometrics and jumps, but not a lot. We are not going to jump off anything high. We usually set some hurdles up and jump over them. We have a jump floor built in the middle of the weight room. We got this from a flooring company back in Baltimore. We just jump over hurdles that are to one side on the jump floor. We set some cones up and jump with one leg over to the other side. All this is special strength. That is all it is. We are just jumping over some little things.

As they get more confident, we play games. Last week, we had five hurdles set up that they had to jump over. After the last hurdle, we had a box that they had to jump up on or jump over. We had a 350-pound offensive tackle who was not able to jump up on the box. We started teasing him, telling him it was the "box of death" and that he could not do it. He got mad and proved that he could do it. As he got more confidence, he proved that he could do it. It was a fun thing. It was at the end of training. It was jump hurdles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and jump on the box. That was at the end of our training.

Back to Monday: plyometrics, wave squats. What are wave squats? We take a load of about 25 percent of what we can squat, and we are going to put it on our shoulders. We are going to do 2 plus 4 plus 2 with it. It may be 1 plus 5 plus 1. It may be 3 plus 6 plus 3. It is something along that pattern. We are going to put the bar on our shoulders, and we are going to squat. The bar is on our shoulders and we are going to squat, 1,2. Next we are going to do four quarter squats with power. The coaching point is this. I want to see a violent change from one direction to the other. It is from down to up. We are not doing squat jumps. I have 30 players in the weight room. I can't watch 30 guys doing squat jumps. If I were coaching one long-jumper, yes, but not 30 football players in the weight room. We are going to do our quarter squats: bam, bam, bam bam. We want an explosive change of direction, down to up. What is the key when you are doing the vertical jump? It is being able to get from the down position to the up position and get up in the air. What is the key when you are changing direction on the field? How quickly you can get from one point to the other. You want to create separation on offense and close separation on defense.

We are doing 2 plus 4 plus 2. It is with a light load. We use 20 to 30 percent. We use the hang in the 20 to 25 percent region. When they first start, they will have trouble with their balance. You have to teach them to sit up, just as you do in a jerk.

On Monday we go out and do our speed skill drills. We will work up to where we are doing some fast sprints. They are 20- to 50-yard sprints. Also, we do bench presses; that lasts about one-half hour. All of the coaches want everyone to bench-press 400 pounds. If a kicker can't bench 400 pounds, he can't kick a field goal! Everyone has to bench-press 400 pounds before they leave. This is not going to do them any good unless they get knocked down and they have to get up really quickly. You do not have to bench 400 pounds to be a good football player, because that is not how the game is played. I have worked with a number of players who have gone on to the NFL who could not bench-press 400 pounds. Most of them were just average on the bench press. Now, they all could clean well over 300 pounds, squat 500 to 600 pounds, and move and change directions. The key to the game is butt, back, hip, and legs. That is our Monday workout.

Tuesday is a power day. We warm up, and then we do some cleans. We are going to do either hang or power cleans. We are going to do some jerks. What are jerks? It is the same movement as the quarter squat. Every

 





Page 158

movement that we do in the weight room with weights is with jumping. A squat is a very slow jumping movement. It is all jumping and running. When you played hopscotch when you were six years old or when you jump rope, it is still jumping. We are just going to get more fancy with it. We are going to clean and jerk, and we are going to do single-leg squats. We do not do front squats. Most of our guys are built for speed, and they are long from the hips to their neck. If we try to put the bar up high, it gives them trouble, because on the clean it puts the bar under their throat. They can't lift with the bar on their throat. They have to hold the bar off their throat. For that reason, we do not do them. You have to spend so much time, we just do not do them. That is the reason we went to the single-leg squat.

We are going to elevate our back leg on something. We have benches beside our squat racks. The key is this: The front leg cannot be back more than the knee or even with the knee. If you do not do that, you will start opening your hips up, and you put a lot of pressure on the SI joints. You will have players with SI joint problems. Just as when you do a lunge, you want the front foot turned in just a little for balance and stability.

Then you go to this position with the knee even with the back knee, or the other knee. The rules are the same as in squatting. It is big breath, sit, and come back up. I am not going to get the top of the thigh parallel, because it is almost impossible. That is all right. I will get to hamstring parallel. That brings the ham into play. Our load is going to be fairly light. We are going to move down slowly and up quickly. Our guys who were squatting 500 pounds had trouble starting with 135 pounds on this drill, but now we have players who will do 180 to 200 on this. We keep the reps low: two to four reps. If you start doing six, seven, or eight reps, they will constantly get sore in their butt. They get sore in the butt, they get tight in their ham, and their back gets tight. We keep the reps low. We keep the weight conservative. We do not want anyone struggling on it. We want good movement. We want to move the weight down slowly and up quickly. That is called compensatory acceleration. You can overload them with more weight, more reps, or more speed. In this lift we use a combination of all three. We always finish fast.

Now we are going to go over and do power step-ups. We are going to go unloaded to a bench. As I stomp on the bench, I drive up in the air. Where is this important? It is the first get-away step in sprinting. It is very important in football. How many steps do the offensive linemen get? One and then contact. He needs to come off the ball harder and faster. It is the first step, the get-away step. It is key, key, key! We want to finish fast.

So, we do single-leg squats, we do power step-ups, we do hang cleans, and we do jerks. After single-leg jerks, I do not feel comfortable taking players out on the field and sprinting them for 40 yards. When you get a lot of single-leg work going or a lot of lateral agilities going, you can irritate their lower back. It is not ''Oh, coach, I hurt my back," but their SI joint gets out of whack. It is just like when you are running straight ahead in the middle of the season and they have had no problems, then one day you hear one of them say, "Coach, I pulled a groin." How can you pull a groin running straight ahead? They have been training for weeks. How can they do it? It is because of the back. The back gets out of whack.

If any of you have ever been to a chiropractor, he will tell you something like this: "Your hips are out of alignment, and you have one leg shorter than the other leg." Well, that really can't happen. If you get your hips out of alignment and have one higher than the other, now you are pulling unevenly on the muscle. You are running straight ahead, and the groin pulls. That is because it has an uneven stress on it. It is a muscle imbalance. We all know that the quad-to-ham ratio causes hamstring pulls and all of that. You can also have an imbalance just because the muscle is being stressed or stretched. It can be stressed from front to back and other ways. For those reasons, I do not feel comfortable sprinting them on Tuesday. We go out and work on stance and starts. We do them for 10 to 15 yards. On Monday we will do 8 to 16 of the 10- to 15yard stance and starts. We run forward and laterally using the crossover step, pulls, and all kinds of stuff.

 





Page 159

Wednesday is kind of a day off from the weight room. We are still going to do strength work, because we are going to go on the field and do some agilities. We have a long warm-up. We do speed skill drills for 15 minutes. Then we are going to loosen up. Then we do a few agilities. They may get 12 to 16 reps in agilities. Compare that to a morning mat drill program: They get 60 reps in 30 minutes; we get 12 to 16 reps in about 15 minutes. Our intensity is higher, but our tempo or our workout is lower. That is because they get plenty of rest. Once they finish that part of the workout, we do some running, but not hard. Then we lie down and stretch for 10 minutes. It is like track practice. We do 20 minutes of work in one hour. We are trying to recover from the day before. The next day will be a squat day.

We come in on Thursday and do our warm-up. Now we go over, get on a platform, and do light hanging shrugs, hanging cleans, front squats, and press. It is just technique work. It is nice and smooth, but it is going to get them loose to hit that low position. Then we hit something fairly fast, but with a very light load. Now we get under a squat bar. We use all safety squat bars. It is a safety bar with a big yoke that comes down, with handles that you can hold on to. The problem with lower backs is that when you get into too much work or you get into too much sheer force with the back forward, the angle is shearing down through the disk. If you sit up straight and squat and put the load straight down, you have pure compression force that the body is built to handle. So we use the safety squats. Again, our guys are long-waisted and long-legged.

Instead of wearing me and them out trying to get them to do it right, because dynamically and physically they can't do it, we just use the safety squat. We get them in there and go, "Racket, handles, grab hold, deep breath, wide knees, sit, and here we go, baby." We just load the weight on them. I do not have to coach technique. I can coach to get stronger. Weights, weights.

We have three players who squat 900 pounds on a safety squat. If it were a straight bar, I would guess it would be about 750 pounds. These guys can really squat. They do not have to work on bending over or technique. They just get in the weight room, and most of them do not even wear a belt. We squat max one time per year in March. We will power-clean three or four times per year. That is because the athlete is in control. If he gets into trouble, he can get away from it. On squats I have to have three men on the same page helping me out of the box. The squat max scares me to death.

After we finish squatting, we go jump up on boxes. If you are a long-jumper, what kills you? It is not the jump; it is the landing. If you are doing jump training, what is going to kill you? It is the landing. So we go over to a box, and we jump up on the box. Now we walk down the boxes. I have to jump high, but I walk back down. I can always jump up.

If we want to work on reactive strength, like cutting and changing directions, we walk up and jump turned to the side of the box. If we are working on starting strength, we will walk up to the box, pause, and then jump. If we want to work on reactive strength on the platform, we do a hang clean or a hang snatch. It is down-up. Stress reflex up. If we want to work on starting strength, we will work power clean from the floor. What are pulls? Pulls are cleans, but we do not rack it. I pull it and let go. Why do I want to pull and then let go? What kills you in a clean? It is not the pull, but the catch. Now I can go a little heavier, pull it, and then let go. No problem. It is the same reason we jump on boxes. We alternate pulls on Tuesday and Thursday. We can alternate those in and out and end up going heavier.

After we finish the squats and finish box jumping, we go out and run. On Thursday we run 130s. It is over distance with a nice, easy stride. How do you do that? It is from one corner to the opposite corner of the football field. We do six 130s. We have three guys across, and we stride to the corners. Then we walk across. When the group gets to the starting point, they go. Then they walk back across the field. We do not run a lot in any one day, but we run every day.

On Monday we are fast. On Tuesday we have power. I have strength, and I have some speed left. Wednesday

 





Page 160

is a recovery day. On Thursday I am strong, and I am lifting weights. What is left for Friday? I can't be fast; I can't be powerful; I can't be strong. All I can do is work.

On Friday we do fitness. We do circuits. We get our freshmen in, or we are in the off-season and they are being red-shirted. We can do some of this three days a week with our non-travel players. We tell our skill players that they must learn to like Thursday. What do skilled players do in high school? They play three sports, usually. They play football, basketball, and baseball or track. When did they ever lift heavy weights? They may have done a little bench press. So we tell our skilled players that they must learn to like Thursday. When we do fitness on Friday, they just fly through it, because they are already in shape. It is easy for them, because they do not weigh very much. The big guys like Thursday. Ha! Dumbbell, bench, squats. Friday, they are sick. They just don't know if they can make it.

Steve Javorick coached our Olympic weight-lifting coach when our Olympic coach was a lifter for Romania. He got a silver medal in Los Angeles. Steve's thing is this: The more fit you are, the more work you can do; the more work you can do, the more quality work you can do. He invented something called dumbbell fitness training. If I had a pair of dumbbells, I would use 10 percent of my weight if I weighed 178 pounds. Now, this will not work for the heavy guys, because they will have more fat on them. They have to go 10 percent of their fat-free weight. We figured that out for all of our players. For most of the young guys, you can give them a set weight, but if I had a partner up here and we were going to do a dumbbell fitness workout on Friday, this is how we would do it.

We put a chart up that shows 8 to 12 exercises. It has quarter 1 and the number of reps. Then it has quarter 2 and the number of reps. Then comes quarter 3 and the reps, quarter 4 and the reps, and the overtime and the reps. If you are my partner, you are up here with me. We are working with 22 1/2 pound dumbbells. I look up at the chart, and it says 10 hang snatches. Now, I have 24 players lined up. We have 12 working and 12 watching. The first man is up. Ready, go! He does 10 hang snatches. As soon as he gets to number 10, he sets the dumbbells down, the other man picks them up, and he does 10. It is just like football. Work, rest, work, rest.

Now, the first man picks up the dumbbells, and he has 10 squat push-presses. He goes to 10 and then sets them down. The second man is up. What does he have? He has 16 step-ups on one leg. He does 16 and then switches legs. He does the 16, and the next man is up. We get 8 to 12 exercises done in the first quarter. It is like a mat drill, only it is with weight and you do not go anywhere. The first time we do it, you can find out who has courage and who doesn't. The ones who do not have courage count like this: 8, 10,14, 16, coach. Then you have to start counting for them. "Two more." "But, coach!" "You have two more." Just start counting their reps. It is easy to cheat. It is toughness training. That is all it is. It is will-power training. You are competing with the man in the mirror. You can make it really hard, or you can make it really easy. Our guys love Friday. The first day that our new coach Dave Roberts, who came from Notre Dame, saw us work out was on a Friday. We were doing fitness work. He though that it was great. If he had come in on Monday with the players doing snatching and doing a few jumps, he would have said that we had too many players standing around. Fortunately he came in on Friday. He thought it was great. We had the players yelling and talking it up. We were doing what we think is great in football. The players know that they must get ready for Friday on Thursday. They know Friday is going to be tough. You can do any kind of movements that you want. It can be side lunges, or lateral step-ups. It goes on forever. We end up with about 300 reps on Friday. You will get some fitness out of this. You can get players bigger in a heartbeat with this. Think of all the reps. What gets you bigger in body building? Reps. That is a bunch of reps on Friday. We may do giant sets that are similar to circuits.

That is what we do for our workouts in a day. We have to finish fast with a similar movement. We always have to finish with running. If you can't run, you can't play. After we finish squatting, we will go out and do six of the 130s. On the first 130, they are running slow because they have just finished squatting. Now, on the

 





Page 161

sixth 130, we have players racing. It takes them about six to get back into it. You have to leave the nervous system with a feeling of speed and a feeling of being explosive. If you don't, the nervous system will be very strong and very slow, or it will be very strong and nonexplosive. It is the total key to everything you do.

What does the nervous system have to do with it? You have to train one body part by taking two days off and training the body part. Yes and no. Yes, if you max out. You would not want to come back the next day and go max squats or heavy cleans. No, that will not work. You would hurt someone.

Let's look at the key to nervous system training. How can women come to college, after five years weigh the same, but lift 100 pounds more in a squat? How can that happen? With guys, don't you have to get the muscle bigger to get stronger? No, it is the nervous system.

We used to get ready for a football season. Around the 4th of July we started getting ready. That is what we used to do. Now, in college, you go to year-round school. In June, you are in summer school. Why? You must have a good graduation rate. You better have players in condition. You better not get players hurt because you have only 85 scholarships. How do you do this? You put them in summer school in June and July. You have eight or nine weeks of lifting and running. You can get them in good shape. Say you go to a camp. They have eight or nine weeks in the summer. Then you have fall, which is 16 weeks long. Then in college, we have bowl preparation, which is another month. Now we are up to 28 to 29 weeks of the 52. Then you get two weeks off. Then they come back, and you are into the off-season program for nine weeks. Now we are at 37 weeks. Then we have spring practice that last four weeks. Now we are at 41 weeks. Then comes May. The older players work out in May for three weeks. Now you are at 44 weeks out of the 52 that players are training. It is year-round training now. In college it is, and it is in a lot of high schools. You have to train year round. Do you think Michael Johnson takes six months n the off-season? He takes about six days off. He starts doing things, not necessarily track work, but he starts working. You have to train year round, but when we come up to play Michigan in the fall, it still comes down to who has the best players. I think we are still working on that part of it.

Now we will get into some practical things. Let's review the work for the week. On Monday we do footwork, we do core work, and we do what we call pre-hab, which we get from the trainers and the physical therapist. Now, if we can do certain exercises before they get hurt, perhaps they will not get hurt, or if they do get hurt, the injury will not be as bad and they will recover from the injury more quickly. We finish our warm-up with loosening. I will cover all of this really quickly. Everyone knows what the speed-agility ladder is. We do that at least once a week. We do all kinds of drills. The players even make up drills. We make it fun for them, but we make it fast. We finish with that type of activity. Then they are jazzed up and ready to go.

Another thing we do is called line hops. We take tape and put it on the floor, or we will take a stripe on the floor or on the field, and we do little hops. It is basic plyometrics, but it is also knee and ankle rehab. We take a spot, and we hop to it. We hop forward, and we hop backward. We hop staying on the stripe. We go zigzag forward and then backward, staying off the stripe. We go laterally. We just keep going back and forth. We do hammer: "Don't touch the stripe moving forward." When they get good, we have them move the hands inside,just as a sprinter does. We are always coaching sprint technique.

When they get bored with that, we go a third of the way down the stripe and put a dot, line, or mark. We go another third of the stripe and put a dot, line, or mark. It is the same drills, but now we have them pause at the dots and stick it or touch it. Why is that important? If I am not a knee bender, I cannot play football. If I am not a knee bender, I can't stop. If I am not a knee bender, that is how I blow out my anterior cruciate ligament. We use this especially with our big guys who have big quads. Really quick, you have heard the statement about the old lineman. He can't play because he can't bend at the waist. We stress posture

 





Page 162

and bending your knee. We want to look as if we are in a racehorse position, or jockey position, ready to kick back and go into our pass set.

We do the drill sideways. Then they get bored with that. Now we do a circle. We have them touch the ground as they go around the circle. We stress space awareness. We have a small receiver who made the best catch I have ever seen because he could make a change from one shoulder to the other shoulder and reach for the ball at the last second to make the catch. That is why we do space awareness. It incorporates those kinds of movements. Those are called tape or line hops.

We do jump-rope drills. In the summer, when we get into line hops and the players get bored, we tell them to get a jump rope. Now we have them do the line hops with the rope. Now it is more difficult. Then they get good, and we tell them to turn the rope backwards. We just keep doing the same things, but we add a twist to make it harder.

Core work is any kind of AB work. We do a ton of AB work. If I am swinging a bat, 50 percent of the power that I generate with my legs will not get to the front of the bat if I am weak in my core. If I am a tackle and I try to reach a defender, this is what happens. How is he going to turn the man and press him if he is not strong in his ABs? Why do we get linemen with back problems? Is it because they squatted too much, too early? It is because they did not do core work. When they try to twist and turn the defender, they get thrown back on their backs. That is why they are getting back problems. It is a combination of a lot of things. We do a lot of core work. We do weighted ABs and nonweighted ABs. We twist and turn and throw medicine balls.

One of the things we do in pre-hab is this. We get on a bench press or a soft-surface bench and take our shoe off. Now the joint is unstable. I have to balance myself on one leg and come down and then come back up. We bend down on the one leg and then come back up. It does not matter if they are 150 pounds or 350 pounds. They have to be able to do this. Why? When they first start doing it, they are weak in the knee area. We have been very fortunate with knee injuries over the last four years. Part of that may be luck, but we feel the exercises help.

We do not sit down and stretch before we work out. We get ready, and we loosen up, but we do not sit down and work out. If it is a 6 A.M. workout, we line up, and the first thing we do is this. We go "break down, set, go." We go through our commands, whatever they are. They will change this year, as we have a new coach. Then the first thing we do is walking lunges. Our guys have to change directions down in a low position. That is why we do walking lunges. We come back with walking shuffles. "Squat, shuffle, step; squat, shuffle, step." They are going to get down low and change directions.

Next we go into our sprint skill drills. If any of you coach track, you know what I mean. It is A's and B's and all of that stuff. We do a couple of things differently. We will do skips. They are not grade-school skips, they are sprinter skips. I want the toe up, and I do not worry about the knee. If I do not have the toe up, I am not getting the correct mechanics. We go toe up, and we skip in that position. I want the arms at 90 degrees. It is what we call check to check.

After skips, we do butt kicks. We will do skip kicks or foreleg reaches. We do not do the hurdler stretch. It is fine if you are a hurdler or a sprinter, but these guys are football players. As soon as they start reaching, that is how they run faster. This is not true. You push when you run. That is all you do. If you reach, you land on your heel, and you are walking. It is just push. It is push, push, push. We do skips and butt kicks. We do slide kicks. We slide our ankle up by our knee. We do not do high knees. When kids do high knees, they want to lean back. You can't lean back when you sprint. If you do the high knees, you are teaching something wrong. We do skips, butt kicks, and slide kicks.

We work on arm action by having them sit down. They use the arms at 90 degrees. We go shoulder's height or cheek to cheek. They bring the elbow up high. We gradually increase the speed. We start out in the first

 





Page 163

gear, then the second gear, the third gear, and the fourth gear, and then we go to overdrive. Once they learn to do that drill sitting down, we stand up and do the drill. We may stand behind them, have them put their hands out, and have them touch the elbows to the hands. That is all we do on arm drills.

We have skips, butt kicks, slide kicks. Next we do backward skips. It is for rhythm purposes. The way we teach it is just as if you had just shot a free throw in basketball and you are lazy getting back on defense. You just back-skip. They can learn that very fast.

Now we tell them to get their heel up to their butt, get the hand behind them, and reach back. That is all of our anterior-posterior back stuff.

Then we do our side stuff. This includes shuffle, carioca, and the high-knee carioca by getting it up and over. You can't be low when you do this. You must be tall. We are working on getting the hip and back loose. That is what we do in our warm-up. We do these on Mondays and Wednesdays after we go outside. We work on sprint skill drills. It kind of fades out on Mondays, because of time and because they get bored with it, but we do it every Wednesday. They get bored again on Wednesday, but we still do it, though we may do it one leg at a time. We tell them to skip with the left leg only. Then we go on the right leg only. Then we do the butt kick right leg only, slide kick left leg only, skip backward left leg only. When you get your linemen to where they can do that, they can move.

Another thing we do is to get on a hill. We will kick-step up the hill. We go up the hill diagonally or straight back and power-step down the hill. We are doing the same things you have to do on a football field with resistance, but we are doing it on a hill.

That is an idea of some of the sprint and skill drills we do in warm-up. Agility drills are agility drills. I was talking with the Nebraska people. Do you know how far their offensive linemen run in agilities, conditioning, and sprint work? Everything is at 40 yards. From the time a freshman gets to Nebraska until the time he leaves as a senior, the longest run he will have is 40 yards. I am sure that in football practice they do some other things that are longer than the 40 yards on the field, but in the off-season and the rest of the time with the strength coaches, it is the 40 yards. How can they be so good? They spend two years of lifting, running, and eating before they can ever play. This is true with most of their players. It must be nice to have that situation. Most of us are not that fortunate. Some of our players are a year out of high school, and they have to play. Next year when we come to Michigan, we will have to put three pairs of pants on some of them so you will not be able to see the stains on TV.

On Friday when we go to fitness, we try to unload the body. We do a lot of reps, but with a light load. We do a lot of squat-jump work. Also, we do a lot of circuit work. We will do 110s, and we do the steps.

As our running goes through the week, we will do 50s on Monday. We run across the field, then walk 20 yards. I do it that way because you do not have to worry about discipline because they are always moving.

On Tuesday we do stance and starts. We run straight ahead and laterally. The key on stance and starts is this. They had the Burns Seminar in Dallas a few weeks ago. Vern Burns is the person who taught me the theory on positive shin angle, and we have adopted it. If I am going to run a 40-yard sprint, this is how Burns would teach it. You can take any kid who runs a 40, and if he starts in a football stance, I tell him this: In one hour, I can knock one tenth off his time. Usually it takes about 15 minutes. If I am a personal trainer, it is easy to do. ''Ready, go. You ran a 5.2. Let's go again. Ready, go. You ran a 5.1. Pay me." Electronically, and here is how. If I get into a football stance and I take my first step, the clock is running. If one tenth has gone by, I still have 40 yards to go. I have taken the first step as I am supposed to do, but in the football stance, I still have 40 yards to go. We teach the bunch start. If you are a small player, it is easy. If you are tall player, you have to drop off the line about six inches. We do stance and starts every Tuesday. We do 12 to 16 of them. We just wear them out with it. How do you get better? By reps.

 





Page 164

I will show you the drills, and then I will show you the techniques that Burns taught me. We crowd the starting line and are a fist short of the line. If we have a tall player with long legs, it is going to be a fist and a thumb off the line. It does not matter which foot you put up. Your feet are going to be a fist's width apart, just as if you are in starting blocks. You want to scrunch up your back toe. It has to be turned under tightly. If it is pointed down but not turned under, we do not get the effect we need. Turn the back toe under really tight. If you are short, you need to get the back knee even with the front ankle. If you are long, it will be even with the back of your heel.

Next I want to lay my chest on my thigh. I look like an Olympic sprinter almost. I want to get my weight forward and my butt up. Now I want to get some posture. Here is the key to the whole thing. This is the coaching point. What is the front knee doing? That knee has to be ahead of the toe. When I start, I drive the lead hand shoulder high. I am going to be just like an offensive lineman and get the lead foot on the ground.

How do we teach the drills to do this? It is simple: mountain-climber starts. They get in a push-up position. I want to bring my right foot up even with my left knee, not any higher. As soon as it comes higher, they stumble. We have them come out of the stance in three steps. We say, "1, 2, 3, go." They go three at a time. They are not going full speed.

Next we go to scramble-up and go. They get down in a push-up position. They scramble up and go. We go on sound and movement. This is when I start having fun. This is how we do iton sound: "Ready, go. Next group. Go." Now we tell them that we are going on movement. "Ready, go." About half of them start out before they realize they are going on movement. We teach them to go on movement as well as sound.

The key to strength is the nervous system. This is something I learned from a coach at Washington. He is the assistant strength coach. He is a national or world-class power lifter. It goes back to training the nervous system. We have all done this. You get on a bench and you do 10, 8,6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 8,10. The 10, 8, 6, 4 are on the front side; when you use the same exact weight on the back side, it becomes easier. Why? Because once you get to the heavy set of 2 and you start coming down, your nervous system synthesizes to lifting heavier weight, so the sets of 4 and 6 feel lighter. So we do it on our front side in our workouts on our power lifts, that is, the squat and bench. We use as few sets and reps as we can to get to as heavy a weight as we are going to use that week. Our heaviest set is usually just one set. It does not matter if it is a set of eight at 65 percent or a set of three at 85 percent. It may be a set of two at 91 percent. We use as few sets as possible and conserve as much energy as possible so that we can get to that point. From there, we are going to go to work. Now you can see why Monday takes 30 minutes to bench-press. We will do 10 or 11 sets of bench press.

On Thursday we do 9 or 10 sets of squats, but it follows this pattern. Let's say we are doing a set of three at 85 percent. Next, we come back down and do four sets or five reps at 80 percent. The first two sets feel like nothing. Those third, fourth, and fifth sets are tough.

Now I am going to stay at 80 percent on the bench. Now I am going to double those reps. I do a set of 10 at 80 percent. You can't do that. It is impossible. They will burn out between the seventh and eighth set. That is how I keep track of them as far as getting stronger each week. How many reps did you get on the bench? "Eight, six, eight, ten." He is getting stronger through the month. If it is during the season, I have to adjust his max higher, even though we do not max during the season. But I know he is getting stronger because he did 10 reps. He can't do 10 at 80 percent. That is a max set. It is double what we are working at.

Key To Strength: The Nervous System

Here are the methods to develop strength: (1) max loads, one to three reps very heavy; (2) medium loads, four to six reps as fast as possible, best for high school athletes; (3) burnout set, 7 to 20 reps as quickly as possible with great technique. There is a book by Josef

 





Page 165

Drabik published by Stadion Publishing Co. in Island Pond, Vermont. You can call and get the number. The book is 
Children in Sport Training. 
It tells you the age group that kids can do certain lifts. It is from the study done in the Soviet Union when they were picking their future Olympic athletes. The book is very easy to read. This book tells you at what age kids can start lifting heavy weights. Usually it is at the age of 17 to 18. That is why the medium load is 4 to 6 reps as fast as possible. Again, this is good for the high school players. That is why we do not squat max much.

We have a get-big program. One of the things we do is breathing squats. I trained with Wilbur Miller, who is 65 years old. He is still lifting, and he taught me these. Breathing squats, a set of 20, and you can't do 21. If you want a kid to get bigger, that will do it. It is because you are using so many big muscles for so many reps. Another way to do it is 10 sets of 10. That takes too long, because that is 100 reps. One set of 20 is enough.

When I was at Southern Cal, we opened with Memphis State, and they beat us at our place. After the game, our staff wanted to know what type of conditioning other teams were doing, because our guys got tired against Memphis. So I called about 20 of my friends in the business to see what they were doing conditioning-wise. We found out something that may surprise you. The first game of the season is not won by the best-conditioned team. 
It is won by the mostrested team. 
If you have a group of old kids, they can handle more work, because they have a bigger work capacity. It you have a group of young kids, they can't handle as much work. Just because you run them more does not mean that they are going to be in better shape. It just means you ran them more. This is where the question comes in, Are they ready or not? What we found was the fact that we needed to cut back the running drills 10 days before our first game. We will practice, but we do not do a lot of conditioning after that. You may agree or disagree. That is what we found. On Monday after that first game, we come back and start running again. We do our running on Monday and Tuesday.

This next part is our exercise rep schemes. It is straight from Soviet research. Generally, this is how it works. You make a bell curve: 5 reps, plus or minus 1. A third to one half of all of your reps are going to be 5s. The squats are 4, plus or minus 1. Snatch and cleans and the Olympic lifts will be 2, plus or minus 1. It is automatic.

Exercise Rep Schemes

Bench press: 5 ± 1; use all three methods.

Squats: 4 ± 1; use mainly number 2.

Snatches and cleans: 2 ± 1; use mainly number 2.

Anytime we start our running drills, we go tall, fall, and run. Why? It teaches posture. When I hit the position of leaning forward, I have to run or fall. We want to be tall. That first step is the important one. We want to get the foot on the ground quickly. If we are doing speed work, we start in the sprint stance. If we are doing football drills, we use the football stance.

We do what we call quick foot. We want the foot on the ground now. You cannot accelerate unless you are pushing.

We go out and do speed drills on Monday. We go tall, fall, and run 65 percent across the field. We walk 20 yards; go tall, fall and run 75 percent across the field; walk 20 yards; tall, fall, and run 85 percent across the field; and walk 20 yards. Then we either do one more or start on our five drills. If they are still tight, we will do another one.

The first of the five drills is hands; tall, fall, and run; hands. I want to see my hands. Are they doing the right thing? The next drill is hammer. I can't see it; I have to feel it. It is just like driving a nail. We are driving a nail, driving a nail.

The next drill is toe-up. This is a tough drill. We are standing there, and we tell them to feel their big toe.

 





Page 166

Move it around. Now we go tall, fall, and run toe up. Watch their feet as they go by. They go from hitting the ground and taking a long time to push off to a quick push-off. Why? Because the muscle in stretch contracts faster with more force. Why do linebackers lean forward when the ball is snapped? Why does the tailback move his feet slightly when he starts his footwork on a play? If the muscle is in stretch, he can move faster. Why do baseball pitchers go through the windup? To stretch all of their muscles before they are balanced to deliver the ball to the plate. We have to put the calf in stretch. When they contact the ground, they push off.

The next drill is heel-up. This is good for our linemen. They tend to have a low-heel recovery. They run like a jogger instead of a sprinter.

The last drill is the tall tummy. Look at the sprinters coming down the track to the finish line. You could put a glass of milk on their heads, and they would not spill a drop. They are tall; they are rotating their arms and hips and pushing off with their feet. The clue is tall tummy. If the pro scouts measure them, they can get more money.

Men, I have a videotape to show you. Really quick, two more points. You have to take care of the people who took care of you. First, I want to thank Don Lessner and his staff for taking care of me. This has been a neat clinic. The people of Michigan have been very friendly. It has been fun. I know it will not be this way when we come back in the fall. I want to thank you for paying attention. I hope I have given you something that will help you.

AdvoCare is the company that sponsored me for this clinic. They have some really great products. If you are interested in their product, it is on the handout. It is a quality product, and I recommend it to you. Thank you for your attention.

Thank you very much, Ken. It certainly is a pleasure for me to be here. We ordered our state championship rings a few weeks ago. I told the rep making the rings that I was going to be speaking at the Louisville clinic and that I wanted a ring that everyone could see. I told him I wanted the best thing he had. I hope everyone can see this ring.

We have had a great experience. We were invited to the State House, and we went on the floor of the senate with all of our kids. That was a neat thing for all of us. We did win our league this year; it was the first time ever. We did win the state championship, which was the first time ever.

When Earl Browning called me to speak at this clinic, I told my wife that I had finally arrived. This really means something special to me.

I played at the University of Kentucky under Charlie Bradshaw. Some of the things that I am going to talk to you about today we did years ago. I learned a lot of football, and I learned how 
not 
to treat players and people. I learned how to treat people, and I learned about hard-nosed football. That is what we play in our league. That is why we were able to win the state championship.

I am going to talk with you about some of our coaches. We use some volunteer coaches in our program. I will talk to you later about the volunteer coach and how important that is to our system. I am sure a lot of you have the same situation. We have an open date next year. It is our 10th date, which is October 31. We are interested in a game for that date. I am also the athletic director at our school, so if you are interested, see me. We are in a bind for this date. There is only one school in Ohio that has that date open, and they will not play us. We would be willing to play anyone. If interested, let me know.

If you are not familiar with Ohio high school football, this next section will not mean a lot to you. Some of you from this area will recognize some of the schools we played last year, especially the Cincinnati schools. To put things into perspective, this is the schedule we played this year:

The point I want to make is this. You can see by our scores that we had a lot of close games. You have to win the close games to have a great year. Again, I am the athletic director, and I am the one who set it up. I

think we play the most demanding schedule in the state of Ohio in Division I, which is the highest. In Ohio you must qualify to get into the play-offs. You have to make the final 16 teams in the divisions to get into the state play-offs. When you get into the top four in your region, you become one of the top 16 teams in the state, and you get into the championship play-offs. I have been at Lima Senior High School for 13 years now. Every one of the teams on our schedule has been in the Division I state play-off over the 13 years I have been at Lima. Three of those teamsSt. Francis, Princeton, and Fairfieldhave won the state championship since I have been at Lima. And Cleveland St. Ignatius has won several state championships. Our schedule has really dominated the play-offs over the last 13 years.

I do want to show you some charts that I think will help you, especially the young coaches who are here. I like them, and they are things that I have stolen over the years. I would be glad to send them to you if you would write me. I have spoken to several clinics recently, and I have mailed several packets to coaches asking about our charts. Write to Coach Leonard Rush, Lima Senior High School, 600 South Pierce Street, Lima, Ohio 45804; telephone 1-419-998-2051.

Let me tell you a little about our school. We are located in northwest Ohio. We are between Toledo and Dayton. We are in the Greater Miami conference. Our league is based in Cincinnati. We play a lot of the Cincinnati schools. We do a lot of traveling. A close game to us is a two-hour bus trip. We added Massillon to our schedule this year, and that was a three-hour bus trip. We had 566 males in our top three grades last year. The Division II break is at 525 males. We are a small Division I school. We are the smallest Division I school to win the state since they started using the setup. In 41 years of football, Lima Senior has had only five losing seasons. Our expectations are to win.

I started talking about our coaching staff. This is how we break our staff down: We have five coaches working on offense and six coaches on defense. Three of these are volunteer coaches. This is how we treat the volunteer coaches. If you come to me and ask me if you can be a volunteer coach, this is what I tell you. You must be in attendance for everything that we do. If you do not want to do that, then you do not want to volunteer for us. So you can see that our volunteer coaches are full-time assistants.

We have three freshman coaches. We have grades 9 to 12 in our building. We have three middle schools that have two coaches at each level. That is the way our program is broken down.

I am going to talk about some of the things we did differently this past year. We give them stars to put on their helmets. Our kids like that type of motivation. Our kids are city kids. If they like that, we will give it to them. We decided this year to give team awards instead of individual awards. If we win, everyone gets a star on his helmet.

We play our starters on our kicking teams. We feel that you will lose if you don't do that in our league. Our quarterback returns punts for us. That is the way we do things. I believe in that, and I will always do it that way. We give special awards to our kicking teams.

I will put up some stats to give you an idea of how we did this past year. This may give you some ideas of the stats we are interested in.

Field goals7 of 15

Of the eight field goals we missed, four of them were from 50 yards or more. We tried unsuccessfully 52-, 55-, 62-, and 67-yard field goals. We had a kid with a very strong leg, so we gave it a try. He did not make the long ones. The 62-yard try was wide.

You do not have to be really smart to figure out that if we scored an average of 30 points and only gave up 11.9 per game, we are going to win some games.

I felt we had the best defense in the state of Ohio this past year. In our keys to victory, you saw that we tried to block every punt. We do not set up walls. We go after the punt. If we block them, good; if not, our quarterback will fair-catch them.

This is what we do. We hit every day that we are in pads. I am talking about getting after it. I will talk about line play later. But our linemen go over to the chutes and on the boards. We put our first- and second-team players over there every day. We did this in our first game and in game 14. We go one versus one. We practice the same in week 1 as the last week. Our kids are aggressive, and we believe in hitting every day. They like that style of practice. We do not let the seniors beat the heck out of JVs in practice.

We run block 75 percent of the time. We threw for 1600 yards this past year, but we work a lot on the run block. We condition our linemen the same as our running backs and wide receivers.

Here are some things we do not do. I am not saying that what we do is the right thing. We do not lift weights much during the football season. We do not get onto the practice field until 4:15. In our area it is dark by 6:30. Our practice facility is away from our school, so we do not mess around with the weights.

We do not watch videos with our kids. Our kids did not watch tapes on the teams we were going to play during the year. We do not use dummies for our blocking drills. We block people.

We do not teach a backup blocking technique. You will not see us hinge-blocking and setting back in our

 





Page 170

stance to block. We do not do that. We do pass the football, and we sprint out. We do combo protection. However, we do not teach a backup blocking technique, per se. We do not use blocking sleds very often. We have all of the great sleds, but we seldom use them. We probably should sell them all, because we do not use them very much.

Now I am going to tell you some of the things we do that we feel helped us for the entire year. We take a composite schedule of all our opponents. In Ohio you must qualify to get into the play-offs. We put our opponents' schedule down. Each week, we keep track of what they did for their games. If they win, we put a W in that column. In the 13 years we have been at Lima, we have been to the play-offs four times in the last eight years. This is something we start looking at very early. It is a goal for our kids to get into the play-offs. If you want to see what we do, I will be glad to mail you a copy.

When I get with the assistant coaches in the summer, we lay out a master practice schedule for them. Our coaches know each day what we are going to be putting into our system. They can look ahead and prepare for the practice. We plan our offense, defense, and kicking game this way.

Every day that we go onto the practice field, we have a practice plan. Again, this is for some of the young coaches. Our coaches know what everyone is doing at all times. We do not waste a lot of time. We do not have a lot of time, so we want to be organized. We have our practice planner on a computer, and we can print it out very fast after we get it set.

Another thing our assistant coaches like a lot is this duty chart. I put it all down in writing. If you are on my staff and you are responsible for videos and you are to trade the tapes with the opponents, you know that you are to do that. Our coaches like this because they know exactly what they are responsible for.

Another chart that we like is our rating of individuals. We send this rating chart to our freshman coaches to rate their players. They may send it down to the middle schools for them to rate their players.

 





Page 171

Now I am going to talk about offensive line play. We had a big team last year. Our starting left tackle was 6' 4'', 260; the left guard was 6' 2", 290; the center was 6' 2", 255; the right guard was 6' 2", 255; the right tackle was 6' 0", 300; and the tight end was 6' 1", 215. Our backup tackles were 6' 0", 285, and 6' 4", 325. The thing I was proud of was the fact that we had kids with good grades. We are not a school where the teachers just give you grades. You have to work hard at our school. We had some bright kids, and that helped a lot.

I am going to talk about our offensive line. We use the four-point stance on offense for our guards and tackles. We get our rear end up in the air, and we bow our necks, so we can see the defender in front of us or at least see his hands. We have our weight forward. We do not teach backup blocking, and we do not trap a lot. We stress four points in our stance. It is balanced and squared, toe-and-heel stagger, hands under the shoulders, hips higher than the head, eyes up. We want our weight forward. Explode with the lead step (no crossover), short first step, let your weight go, roll the hips. Tackles: inside foot back, head in the hole. Our center's stance is the same stance as the other linemen. He is down in a squat. Extend the ball out, free hand on the ground; explode as you snap; lift ball (snatch); charge over ball; roll off the balls of the feet; lead step, short first step.

Now I am going to get to some X's and O's. When I was here two years ago and listened to Terry Bowden lecture, I liked what he did on the sweep play. It became a good play for us. I want to tell you what we do and why we do it. We play against Cincinnati Princeton High School. They are the best team in our league. Pat Mancuso just retired at Princeton. They were very predictable in their defense. They ran a 50 slant defense. We know that if we get them on the hash mark, they are going to slant a certain way. We run our 33 or 32 dive with fold blocking. It is a hard dive at the covered lineman. Here it is with the nose on the center.

33 DIVE VS. 50

 





Page 172

Down on the goal line, we wedge on the tackle in the gap. We come straight off the ball, and the back hits behind the double team. Against the 4-3, it is about the same blocking scheme.

On our isolation play, we were very basic. We expect our running backs to block.

43 ISOLATION VS. 50

We want to run close to the frontside guard's block. Both backs must feel the play side. The tackle must see the inside defensive lineman move. We want our tackles to take at least a 4- to 5-foot split.

Against Cleveland Ignatius and Cincinnati Elder, we faced teams that played the 4-3 defense. They both played their big tackles down tight, almost in a 1 technique. This is how we decided to block them on the isolation play. We brought the center around on the middle linebacker. Now we could isolate to the splitend side.

We scrimmage Cincinnati Moeller High School each year. I understand that they play Louisville Male High School down at Corbin. They play the 4-3 look as well. They play Princeton, and they want to prevent them from running the split-backs veer. They want to take away that inside against the veer. This is the scheme that we used against 4-3 teams.

We do not teach a downfield block. Our backside tackles never go downfield. If they can get downfield before our running backs can, then they should be playing running back. Our running backs do not cut back against the grain. They run toward the goal line. We scoop-block on the backside. We feel we have to do that against teams that slant their tackles really hard. When we want to cut them off, we do a chop block. It is a legal block. We chop them, and let them roll over the top of us. Our tight end goes downfield, but not our linemen.

Next, I want to show you our 25 and 24 veer. It is our inside veer or triple-option play. We read the first man outside of our tackles' block. We like to double-team or wedge-block at the point of attack when possible. We decided to use the crack-back block this year. We had never used it before. We came down inside and blocked the man responsible for the quarterback at times. It was a very successful play for us this year.

If we run the inside veer against the 50 defense, we read the tackle and pitch off the end. I know most of you are saying, "No one is blocking the corner if you are crack-blocking with the split end." You are right. Our running backs weigh 205 pounds; our cornerbacks are 160 pounds. We will take that match.

25 VEER VS. 50 DEFENSE

Against the goal line, we are going to wedge the tackle on the front side and scoop backside. Against the 4-3, it is very similar blocking. We still wedge on the tackle inside.

This next play was a good play for us. We got the play from Cincinnati Moeller. They ran this against us. I liked the blocking scheme against our 4-3 defense.

45 LOG VS. 50 DEFENSE

 





Page 173

It is an inside counterdive, and it may be run from a split-backs or I formation. The log is made by the backside guard. He pulls around the block of the frontside guard. We do run the reverse-out dive option. We fake the dive option and hand back to the tailback. We can run it on the goal line. The offside guard comes off on the linebacker. It is a good play. I think it is a better play against the 4-3 defense. The center blocks back on the tackle, and we put the guard off the center's tails, straight up the field.

The play we like down on the goal line is our G block. We get a double-team block with the tackle and tight end. It is a great short yardage or goal-line play. The lead back and running back read the guard's block on the defensive end. We have a double team at the point of attack. We pull the onside guard and trap the end. If the end comes down, we log-block him. If he goes outside, we trap him out.

46 G VS. 50 DEFENSE

As I said, I liked what Terry Bowden did with the toss sweep. This is how we started blocking it, and it has been a good play for us. Now, we lead the fullback through on the linebacker and pull the guard. It is our power sweep to the tight end. Again, the fullback blocks the linebacker to the side of the play. The guard pulls and blocks the force man. The tailback steps at the line of scrimmage on his first step. He may run the play anywhere inside or outside, depending on what the end does. We are scooping really hard on the back side.

48 POWER SWEEP VS. 50 DEFENSE

As I said, we do throw the football. We run our combo pass protection for our one-step and three-step passing games. We do not release our running backs on this play. We pack it inside. We want to protect the quarterback. Teams are using the blitz more today. We do lock on man, or big on big. The backs block the first man to show outside of our tackle's block. If we get against a team that runs a slant-and-loop tackle, then we will have to keep our tight end in and let him block the second man outside. Our running back can't block both of them. That is our quick-step passing game.

COMBO PROTECTION

We were a sprint-out team this year because we had an outstanding quarterback who could run, and he could throw on the run. We changed our sprint protection this year. We decided that we would have our linemen take a short step inside and block the area. We used to turn inside, but we were getting too much penetration. We decided to step inside and keep our shoulders square.

We never take a man. We can't take care of the blitzes if we take a man. The backs take the first and second men outside of the play-side tackle.

 





Page 174

SPRINT PROTECTION VS. 50

I am going to give you a couple of drills that we like. The first drill is the board drill. I was watching TV one night, and they had a special on Northwestern and the great job they did two years ago. As they were talking to Gary Barnett, they were running this drill. I decided to try it and found it to be a very good drill.

BOARD DRILLS

APosition 1 down = lineman; position 2 = linebacker; position 3 = end of board.

The man with the dummy is downfield about 10 yards. After the blocker comes off the end of the board, he goes downfield to block the deep defender.

BAngled board (3 positions); offense vs. defense; 12foot boards. I told you we do board drills every day.

I got the next drill from Dick Crum when he was coaching at North Carolina. We call this next drill the North Carolina drill. In Ohio you are not allowed to use names that would upset someone or suggest something as bad, such as hamburger drill. So we call it our North Carolina drill.

NORTH CAROLINA DRILL

(1) Snap count starts it. (2) No penalties! (3) Receiver stalks the defensive back. (4) Run to score! (5) Stay inside the dummies. (6) Three downs to score.

We start the drill with a down lineman on offense and a down lineman on defense. We have the quarterback give the ball off to the running backs. We put our receivers in the middle. We have a defensive back who the receiver is going to stalk-block. The cone gets wide as they go down the field. We put the offense on one side and the defense on the other side of the bags. We used to let the men outside of the bags hit the running back if they come outside of those dummies. We feel that this drill helps us teach our backs to get up the field. It is a 10-yard square for the total area. We make it tough for the offensive lineman to start the drill. He has to get down and drive the man out of the hole so the back can get through. It is a safe drill. We do not do it every day, but you are not going to get a lot of kids hurt on this drill.

Every day that we are in pads, we do a middle drill. We line our cones just outside where the tight end would line up. We set the other set of cones at 5 yards. Our goal is to get 5 yards per play. We go first offense versus first defense. Every day that we are in pads, we go for 5 minutes. It is a live drill for everyone. The only thing that I ask the defense is not to kill our quarterback. We run plays only inside of the tight end. After 5 minutes, we let them have a water break. Our kids like this drill.

 





Page 175

MIDDLE DRILL

I felt that we had a very good defense this past year. I judged our practices this year on how well we did against our defense. Our defense was outstanding. We have 12 starters coming back next year. We only had one senior running back. We have eight starters coming back on defense. When we meet next summer, our goals will be to win the Greater Miami Conference, get into the state play-offs, and win the Division I state championship of Ohio. Our goals will not change. We will be very competitive. I have some of the state finals against St. Ignatius that I want to show. If you have any questions, I will be around. Thank you very much.

Pass Coverages in the Eight-Man Front

Michigan State University

Thank you, gentlemen. First of all, I'd like to tell you that it is very much a pleasure for us to come over here and visit with you. I would like to thank each and every high school coach in the state of Michigan. I think you do an outstanding job from a professional standpoint of developing players for college. Anything that we can do to help you develop professionally, we would be pleased to do. Don't hesitate to ask. Come visit us during spring practice.

I'm going to talk about a couple of things here. Any of you who have heard me speak before know I'm hung up on developing the right kind of attitude and chemistry on your team. After that I want to talk about the eight-man front and man-to-man coverage. Most pro teams are playing this coverage now. More and more colleges are going to it, and you could play it very effectively in high school.

I assume you have some of the same problems with your players that we have with ours. The levels are different, but the problems are the same. I would like to talk to anybody here who has any suggestions and can help us in terms of managing young people. We need to get them to do the right things from a behavioral, character, disciplinary, and attitude standpoint. We spend quite a bit of time on that.

We did an interesting thing about a week or 10 days ago. We brought a sports psychologist in to work with our team for three days. He talked to our team about what the team felt and thought. Sometimes we as coaches lose sight of that a bit. This guy had a word that he went through. It was called ''HALT." He had the players write down on a piece of paper what the letters stood for. There were no coaches around. The H stands for, "What are you hungry for?" The A was, "What are you angry about?" The L was, "What are you lonely about?" The last one, T, stood for, ''What are you tired of?"

It was interesting what the players wrote down. You can find out a lot about your team. You need to know what they think and where they are mentally. We are all guilty of relying on personal perception. Sometimes it is good to stand back and view things from the other person's point of view. It did a lot of good for the coaches to see what the players were thinking. It opened my eyes up to a lot of things.

My view of the off-season program is what we need to develop in the players. I want to teach them how to give effort and develop mental toughness. We make it hard. We make them finish every play and give maximum effort. I see all those things as tremendous benefits. But if we don't sell that to the players, all they think is, "I'm tired of running every day." If that is their attitude about running, they are not going to do a very good job of it, because they are not goal oriented in their approach at all. They don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. We didn't make a very good road map for them so they could understand why they were doing what they were doing and how it was going to benefit them.

The last two weeks, I feel we have done a much better job with our team because of our understanding. Does that mean we are compromising our values, principles, and integrity with the way we go about coaching? Not at all. But we can do our job better when we understand where they are coming from. Believe me when I tell you that.

I think the reason we exist as coaches is to help people be successful. If they are successful, we will win games. How do you get them to be successful? The key is consistency in performance. That makes anyone successful in whatever they do. Success is based on performance. What makes people have good performance? They have to want to do it. That is the most important thing.

 





Page 177

As coaches, our perception is that these things are good for you. We are establishing discipline, learning how to give effort, and learning how to finish plays. But to the players, it is a pain in the butt, and it is hard. Therefore, they have no goals or direction. How could they like it, do well at it, and be committed to it? They have no reason to be committed to it, because we didn't sell it to them correctly.

Highly motivated people give consistency in performance. Motivation comes from knowing what you want accomplished and being committed to it. Even if you know what you want to accomplish, what does it take to do it? Your attitude is made up of your habitual thoughts, habits, and priorities on a day-today basis. You can have good or bad thoughts, habits, or priorities, but you control those things. We can change those. If they are bad, we can make them good. That is where it all starts.

Sometimes young people need direction. It all starts with your attitude. The sum of all those habits, thoughts, and priorities is your character. That tells what kind of person you really are. That takes into account the decision you make when the coach is not watching. It takes a lot of character and self-discipline to be committed to something that you want to accomplish. It takes a lot to see it through to the finish.

The first thing is to work and invest your time in something that is important to you. That is critical to being successful in anything. Don James used to say, "You reap what you sow." He was my college coach. He talked about two farmers. One guy worked from sunup to sundown. The other guy sat on his porch all day. When harvest came, the guy who worked hard had the biggest harvest you could possibly have. The guy who sat on his porch had nothing. The price you pay for success must be paid in advance. There is no way you can be successful and not pay the price up front and in advance. It never just happens. You have to make a tremendous investment in it. Invest your time in something. Don't spend it.

The second thing is that you have to stick with it. You have to be persistent and learn from your mistakes. It is so difficult to coach guys right now. They are so self-centered and selfish. So are my kids. It is the way young people are today. It doesn't make any difference how old they are. They have too many choices. They never have to make any commitments to anything. If they are not making any baskets today, they go over and hit golf balls. If the range is a little hot, they go swim in the pool at the country club. If the water is too cold, they go play baseball. They swing three times and miss, so they go do something else. That's what my kids do.

When I grew up in West Virginia in a coal-mining town, we had a company store, and that was it. We had a ball diamond. The company owned it all. When you got up to bat, there was nothing else to do. You kept swinging until you hit it. Most of us hit it pretty good because we didn't have a choice. We made a commitment to doing it because there was nothing else to do. It is not that way now.

As coaches, we always tell our players what they did wrong, but we seldom ever tell them what they did right. I think you have to find ways to reinforce positive performance in the way you coach. You need to be more positive with the players. They always respond better that way.

They have to learn that there is a seed for every good thing in every mistake they make. There is a learning experience in those mistakes. Old Buck Nystrom used to beat our guys with a stick. But they responded to it, and he was one of the better coaches I've ever been around. They used to say to him, "Coach me, coach." That is what he tried to convince them of. They wanted to learn, so he got to them. They took it and respected him. That is what you need to have.

They have to be positive about the negative mistakes they have. They have to see that they are learning from that and growing. In doing that, they learn how to overcome adversity as well.

Our team right now, to me, is right at the choke phase. We are right where we can choke when it counts. That is not negative. I think you have to be damn good to choke. You can't be in a 29-29 game in the fourth quarter with Penn State and not be very good. You

 





Page 178

can't get ahead of Iowa 23-10 going into the fourth quarter and not be very good. But when it got thick in the end, we had too many young players. We didn't have enough prime-time warriors who believed they could make the big play at the end of a game. When they started having that little bit of doubt, they took the apple. They made mistakes they had never made before.

We got a turnover against Penn State on the 14 with less than four minutes to go in the game. We followed that with the three worst plays we had run in the football game. We had 550 yards and got three straight plays with negative yards. After that, we missed the field goal. The guy hadn't missed a field goal inside the 30-yard line all year.

Next the defense came on the field. We had 2nd and long. We doubled the slot receiver. He ran straight across the field. We were playing him inside and outside. The guy who was supposed to take him inside just looked at him. He caught the pass and ran 36 yards into field-goal position for them with less than two minutes to go. We had played the coverage three or four times before correctly. What happened to that guy? I'm not blaming the kid. I'm saying we are not at a level of maturity where guys believe that they can make the play.

In the Michigan game, we were behind 14-10. We went into our two-minute offense with 50 seconds left in the first half. We were on the 50-yard line. We threw an interception, and the guy returned it to our 10-yard line. They scored with 19 seconds left on the clock. They kicked off, and we fumbled the kickoff. They went right in and scored again. With 15 seconds left in the half, they scored 14 points. The second half and the rest of the game, we played all right. Can you overcome that adversity? It is difficult against good football teams. All the teams that I was talking about are good football teams.

I think that all these things come from not believing in yourself, having self-imposed limitations on yourself as to what you can and can't accomplish. They don't have enough confidence in themselves that they can make the play in the most critical time of the game to win the game. That comes from mental toughnessand a lot of self-confidence.

Self-imposed limitations are the doubt we all have. How many times have you as a coach been sitting in the locker room before a big game and had doubts about whether you can win or not? It happens to me sometimes. It happens to your players too.

There was the fisherman in West Virginia. He went fishing. He caught a big fish and a little fish. He threw the big fish back in and kept the little fish. I asked him why he didn't keep the big fish and throw the little one back. He said that he only had a nine-inch frying pan. He put limitations on himself as to what kind of fisherman he could be by what kind of frying pan he had.

I ask our players sometimes how big a frying pan they have. How much confidence do they have? It is important to develop an attitude that you can be successful with.

I can't speak at a clinic without talking about this stuff. I think that's the essence of getting intangibles out of football players. They are simple things like giving effort, playing with toughness, being responsible for your own self-determination, and knowing what you are supposed to do. Those things sound really simple, but how many games do we lose on mental mistakes? How many times do you watch a film where someone is not loafing? How many times do you see your team not demonstrate the kind of toughness, physically and mentally, that you would like for them to play with? Those are all intangibles. It takes no ability to do these things, but very few time do we see them. You have to have a well-conditioned team to be able to do it. If you are not a well-conditioned team, that is when you make mistakes. They make mental mistakes, loaf, and lack toughness when they are tired. Who said, "Fatigue makes cowards of us all"? Of course you know that it was Vince Lombardi.

Let's talk about cover one. The term MOF means middle-of-the-field safety. Anything that has this type of coverage is taught with the same principles and theory. Whether we play three-deep zone with strong

 





Page 179

rotation or three-deep zone with weak rotation, the principles of every position remain the same. Whether we teach man-free cover one with the safety down strong or man-free cover nine with the safety down weak, the principles stay the same. The whole concept of this coverage depends on the area played by the free safety. We feel that a free safety can cover about 35 yards deep and 5 yards outside either hash mark when it is in the middle of the field. For everybody on the defensive field to use the safety's help, they must reroute, funnel, and play leverage on receivers relative to the middle-of-the-field safety.

This coverage starts with the corners. The college football field is a little different from the high school field. The hash marks are 19 yards from the sideline and 13.5 yards apart. The yard line numbers are 7 yards to the bottom and 9 yards to the top from the sideline.

Ten yards from the sideline with the ball in the middle of the field is what I call a divider for the corner. If the receiver is inside the divider of the corner, the corner plays an outside alignment. That is because the safety is in the middle of the field and is relatively close for the post cut of the receiver. If the receiver aligns outside the corner's divider, the corner aligns inside, because the relative distance to the safety where he helps the corner has increased.

The divider determines whether the corner plays inside or outside the receiver. We tell him to play inside or outside relative to the divider. The divider is a plane that runs all the way down the field. If the receiver lines up inside the divider but stems the corner to a position outside the divider, the corner goes from an outside position on the receiver to an inside one.

We tell our safety that if the ball is thrown 25 yards, he should be able to break that far. We teach a little different theory with zone and man coverage.

In three-deep zone, the free safety has to stay as deep as the deeper receiver. When we play man, we settle the free safety at 25 yards. We feel that the one thing that can hurt us is running the post and the dig. If they throw to the dig receiver, there can be no one there unless the corner plays a perfect coverage. The safety needs to jump everything in the middle of the field.

Here is the second concept I want to show you. In a three-deep zone or a middle-of-the-field safety coverage, there are areas on the field that you don't want people to run in. Those areas are the seams of the zone. For the high school field, the seam is 17 yards from the sideline and 3 yards wide. The seam starts at 14 yards from the sideline and ends at 17 yards from the sideline. If you let receivers run down those seams, the safety can't cover those areas. You have to keep people out of those areas if you are playing middle-ofthe-field coverage.

When we play a three-deep zone, someone always drops to the seam and reroutes the receivers out of the seams at 10 yards. If we reroute the receiver at 5 yards, he can run past the defender and get back into the seam. If we reroute him at 10 yards, it is late in the play, and he doesn't have enough time to get back on the seam before he is too deep.

The same thing is true of cover two. We reroute receivers at 10 yards out or in to the seam. The seam in a cover two is the half-defender divider. That creates a leverage field position for the half-field safety. With the three-deep zone, we want the receivers out of the seams, and with two-deep, we want them in the seams.

 





Page 180

Let me show you our cover one. I'll draw this up as an eight-man front. The corners in our defense would be in bump-and-run man on the two wide receivers. The strong safety and three linebackers are responsible for the backs and tight end. The free safety plays over the top in this coverage. The Will linebacker has the split-end side break, and the strong safety has the tight-end side break. Break means "if the formation splits someone else out." If the tailback aligns in the slot to the split-end side, the Will linebacker is responsible for him. That is only for the backs. The corners have the wide receivers all the time.

If the offense brings both wide receivers to the same side, we bring both of our corners over to that side. You may do it differently, but whoever starts out on the tight end has tight-end side breaks, and the Will linebacker always has split-end side breaks. That means we will never have a Will linebacker cover a wide receiver. These two formations are the only ones they can make with normal personnel in the game.

If one of the backs goes in motion to the split end, the Will linebacker covers him. If one of them goes in motion to the tight-end side, the strong safety has him.

Let me get into the techniques of coverage. The divider for the corner is 1 yard on top of the numbers, or 10 yards from the sideline. If I teach a corner to play bump and run, the first thing I want to do is make sure he understands the divider principle. If the receiver is inside the divider, the corner is aligned outside and on his low shoulder. If the receiver is outside the divider, the corner aligns inside and plays high-shoulder position. The receiver wants to get on top because he can go anywhere he wants from that position. We take that away from him. We get on top and cut him off. If the receiver is inside the divider, the corner will be outside and on the low shoulder. If the receiver runs a flag route outside the divider, the corner can easily get to the high shoulder and cut him off.

In the bump and run, the corner should off-hand jam the receiver. If the receiver aligns right on the divider, the corner aligns outside and low. The corner watches the hips of the receiver. As long as the hips are square, the corner is square. As soon as he starts to turn his hips one way or the other, the corners off-hand jams him. If the break is to the inside, the corner jams with his outside hand. If the break is outside, the corner jams with his inside hand. We try to hit between the receiver's shoulder tips and near tip.

Bump and run is the best coverage you can play against anybody, even with marginal athletes. You have a better chance playing guys up on receivers than you do off. The hardest thing to do in man coverage is to play off a receiver and cover him. It is the hardest thing to teach. The corner has to have great feet, be able to redirect, and have a great burst to the ball. Plus, the receiver knows whether he is going, and you don't. When you get up and bump, you are in position to cover the guy, as long as you stay in position and get your hands on the receiver.

Most guys make the mistake of widening their feet and setting back when the receiver breaks. As soon as a defensive back gets in that position, he is beat. To get out of that position, the defensive back has to step back inside his frame to be able to go anywhere. What the back wants to do is keep his feet together, so that when the receiver starts his move, the back can slide

 





Page 181

into him, jam him, and be on top of him. That is the most important thing in bump coverage.

To keep the receiver from walking all over the defensive back, we use a punch at the line to force a release. Just as soon as the receiver moves, the defensive back punches him with the inside hand on the inside tip of the receiver. When that happens the receiver's coach is going to tell him to lean back.

The other thing you can do is to fake a punch. The receiver leans back, and that slows his release. If the defensive back reaches with the wrong hand in bump and run, he is dead. The most natural thing for the defensive back to do is throw both hands up and squat. Either one of those things kills you in bump and run.

We want to protect the middle of the field in bump and run. We give up the out route. Make them throw the ball in the flat, but don't let them throw the ball over your head outside. Those are the hardest passes to complete, so everything is relative to that.

If the receiver takes an inside break, the defensive back jams him the same way. That puts him inside the divide line. The defensive back assumes the low-shoulder position and rides him down the field. If the receiver cuts outside, he is cutting into the defender. If he breaks inside, the defender works down on him, always dragging his back hand so he can hook the receiver. That is the technique in a nutshell.

I could give you a list of drills to do to practice this. You can step and mirror the receiver on release using no hands. Step and slide on the release using no hands. You can do the same drills using the off hands. You have to teach kids to roll over quickly. Kids who play all their life in the off position have trouble turning. If they are turned left and they have to go right, they always slow-turn. When you play close coverage, if you slowturn, you're dead. When the receiver disappears behind the defensive back, the defender has to speed-turn into him. That is the drill we teach. The receiver runs down the field, making the defender roll-turn. Everything you do in close coverage is done with the speed turn.

Emerson Walls ran about 4.9 in the forty. He could not backpedal a step. He could not run a lick, but he always had his man cut off. He always used his help and had 39-inch arms to jam the hell out of people. He was a very effective player and never played in a backpedal. He could half-turn with the best of them, which meant he always had the receiver cut off.

Let's go to the strong safety on the tight end. The first thing we want to know is the alignment of the tight end inside or outside the divider. Most tight ends will be inside the divider. We play our strong safety like a rover back. He aligns 3 yards outside the tight end and 5 yards deep. If the tight end releases upfield, the strong safety runs to his outside shoulder and gets in a low position. He wants to get on the tight end as soon as he can. We never want to play a tight end or a big man in a high position, because he will push off the defender and come back for the ball.

The tight end releases to the outside, and the strong safety plays him on the divider. If the tight end runs into the seam, the strong safety should play even with him. If the safety plays low-shoulder, the quarterback can shoot the ball in there. If the safety plays highshoulder and the quarterback throws at the back pad, he's got the safety too. We run shoulder to shoulder in the seam. Ideally, we want to run the tight end out of the seam. When the tight end runs to the seam, the safety beats him there and makes him break one way or the other. When he breaks, the safety rolls into him and plays his technique.

Let's talk about the three linebackers and the strong safety playing the backs and the tight end. When you are playing middle-of-the-field coverage in man to man, you should never play in-and-out coverage with the tight end and near back. If the tight end runs up the field, the strong safety takes him. If the backs split and go different directions, the Sam linebacker takes the left back coming out, and the Will linebacker takes the right back coming out. The Mike linebacker backs up in the middle of the field to cut any player who comes in the middle of the field. If no one comes into the middle 5 to 7 yards deep, he continues to back up to help on the dig route.

 





Page 182

The Mike linebacker always has the second back out to a side. If both backs flow strong or weak, the Mike linebacker has the second back. If both backs flow weak, the Will linebacker has the first back. The Mike linebacker has the second back. The Sam linebacker becomes what I call the rat. That comes from a rat in a hole. He is the middle player, waiting to cut anything that comes into the middle. The strong safety has the tight end. If the tight end runs a drag across the field, he runs into the rat, who picks him up. The strong safety becomes the rat. That gives us a free guy in the hole both short and deep. We are playing 4 on 3 with all the receivers leveraged off.

If the offense runs a flow or play-action pass to the strong side, the Sam linebacker has the first back out of the backfield. The Mike linebacker has the second back. The strong safety has the tight end. The Will linebacker is the rat. If the tight end runs the drag, the Will linebacker cuts him. The strong safety becomes the rat and could get under the dig route of the split end.

Whoever the free guy is out of the four becomes the rat and cuts off the receivers. The only time the safety gets cut is when the tight end goes across. If the tight end goes vertical, the safety plays outside and the low shoulder. The safety in the sky-force position never has to cover the tight end on an inside move.

Because you are playing 4 on 3, no one is in a run-pass conflict. Everyone can play their gap responsibility on a run and still play pass responsibility without a problem.

Here is a way to work things into your package. Anytime that the safety takes the tight end and the tight end side-breaks, we call that cover one. We could call 0, which means 5 guys rushing with no rat in the hole.

If we call cover nine, the Will linebacker would have the tight end, and the safety would come down weak. It is all the same principle of coverage. What we don't want to happen is to have a linebacker covering a speedster out of the backfield. The strong safety aligns to the split end and has split-end-side breaks. The free safety is in the middle deep but has tight-endside breaks. That gives us a safety playing that speedster out of the backfield instead of a linebacker. If the free safety takes a tight-end-side break, the strong safety rotates to the middle and becomes the middle-of-the-field safety. The three linebackers play the remaining back and the tight end. That leaves us a rat short in the middle.

 





Page 183

The hardest pattern to cover is the double cross by the tight end and slot back. The first thing you do when you get cut off from the receiver who you are covering is to look through the guy who cut you to see whether anything is coming. If there is, it is an automatic cut to the other guy back. That is the first thing. Guys won't do that sometimes. As soon as they get cut off their man, they want to fade back into the hole. What this ends up looking like is a soft zone about 5 to 7 yards deep. When the linebacker gets the cut call, he looks through the guy who cut him and picks up the pattern coming the other way. That way, they don't have to change directions but once.

This coverage will play well in nickel coverage. It plays an eight-man front in the nickel. It will play against four wideouts. It will play against three wideouts and a tight end. In every situation, it makes a front with one more man than the offense has. If you play against four wideouts, you have six in the box and can play the coverage. If they have a tight end, three wideouts, and one back in the game, you have seven guys in the box, and the offense has six to block you. All you need is two guys to play corner. That is why the corners in the NFL always make more money than safeties.

We teach all our coverages the same way. If we play zone, we play cover three and six. When we teach three-deep zone, we teach relationships. We have a flat player who relates to number 1. We have a hook player who relates to number 2 weak. We have a hook player strong who relates to number 3. We have a flat player strong who relates to number 2. We have a corner-corner-free safety in the three-deep coverage. Our weak-side rotation is cover six. Our strong-side rotation is cover three. We teach the drops to everyone.

The progression in zone for us is to drop, reroute a receiver, match the pattern after the pattern distribution, and break on the ball. Matching the pattern after the pattern distribution is another talk. We number the receivers from the outside in on both sides. The flanker strong would be 1, tight end 2, and the back to that side would be 3. The split end weak would be 1, and the running back to that side would be 2. The flanker does a curl, the tight end hooks, and the strong back runs a flat. After the pattern distribution, the back is 1, flanker 2, and tight end 3. This coverage is like man to man, except you don't have a man. If a receiver comes into your zone, he is your man. That is pattern matching. This is good because you don't get picked off.

Fellows I really enjoyed being here. Come to see us any time you get the chance. You guys really do a great job of coaching. Keep it up. Thanks.

Defensive Line Drills and Techniques

Penn State University

Thank you. It is a pleasure to be here at the clinic. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. This clinic has outlasted many others that have come and gone. You are a tribute to this clinic for coming out and supporting it.

Coaches, this is your clinic. If you have questions, ask them, and we'll answer them. I don't know all the answers. When I talk, I talk with the beliefs of what I am coaching. I'm going to talk about what I know. But anytime you have a question, stop me and ask it.

I'm going to move along rather quickly but at the same time be thorough. It doesn't matter what position you coach or the defense you run, this clinic should help. That includes offense. I'm going to talk about a few of the intangibles that help win football games. One of the most important things in football is to get the team ready. You have to teach and motivate for a team to perform. The key is to get players to play at the highest level of their ability. We have to push our kids to the point where they don't think they can do it any more. These players don't know what their highest level is because they haven't been pushed that hard. They have to learn to fall down and get back up.

If a player has feet and courage, that is what it takes to be a good defensive player. I ran into one of our players up in the hall before I came down here. He was our manager. We were getting ready to play Notre Dame, and our long snapper got hurt. This manager lined up and long-snapped the ball against Notre Dame for us.

If a kid has courage, you can teach him to be a big hitter. You can make him the best tackler on the team. If you have courage to hit somebody and feet to get to the ball, that's all defense is. If a kid has those talents, it is hard to keep him on the bench.

This next point is important in football but is also important in life's critical situations. You have to 
control what you can control. 
You can determine whether your team outhustles people. You can determine their getting to the ball. You determine whether your team is in shape. You determine whether your team is in condition. We play two halves of football. The first-half score means nothing. The final score is what counts. You determine whether your team outhits the opponent. We can control the fact that we outprepare people.

We control conditioning. In the winter program, if they won't pay the price and condition, they will get you beat on the goal line. They will lose on the goal line. We rate our players in several areas. We consider conditioning, the weight room, academics, and other areas.

When I have a meeting with my players I put on the blackboard, "Today is today. Make it count." However, it's more than that. It is the moment that counts. Any one of us could walk out of here and drop dead. Any tragedy could happen to any of us. You have to cherish the moment.

Here are some things that you build your defense around. You have to be a productive defense. We talk all the time about forcing turnover. Coach Paterno will come into our meeting and tell us that we need more interceptions and fumble recoveries. We have to force turnovers. The defense must have pride. They have to dominate and defend their area. They have to feel as if no one can run the ball at them. They will defend their area, and no one can run into their area.

We have a saying that is on the board in the linebackers' meeting room: Pay the toll. That is the linebacker area. It is just like the Pennsylvania Turnpike. To use it, you have to pay a toll. Anyone who comes into the linebacker area gets his head knocked off. If a guy crosses the linebacker's face, if he doesn't deck him, he gets a -3 on the grading scale. They are to dominate and control their area.

 





Page 185

You have to play smart, with poise and pride. They have to have confidence in themselves. There may be a guy with less ability who can play because he is confident that no one can beat him. Toughness is what wins the game. You have to think team, be committed, and be unselfish. Those are things that a lot of people don't have today.

You have to do whatever it takes to win. If you want to win, you have to work harder. People can say that they want to win. That is easy. They have to prepare to win through hard work. You can outhustle people, but execution wins.

This next point is a big one. Coach Paterno does this great. We meet every morning. We look at our personnel board. We move people up and down that board. Who should be moved up a number? Who should we move down? You have to get the proper people in the proper positions. We have moved guys from defense to offense. We had a kid who came to Penn State as a linebacker. Now he is a running back. If you get the proper people in the right positions, they make the plays.

You have to talk to your team. They have to understand your goals and what they are working for. We as coaches are going to work hard but smart. We are working to win. Some people work hard, but they don't work smart.

You have to punish people. You won't win games unless you punish people. You have to get your kids ready to punch somebody in the mouth. You have to get people on the run, and when you get them down, put them away. This is a physical game. We want to beat our opponent physically. How fast you get to the ball only matters if you punish people when you get there. You control gang tackling. It is not how fast you are; it is how physical you are. When the running back is getting pounded, he starts asking the coach to spread the ball around a little.

What are the qualities we look for in the defensive line? The number one thing is toughness. I never recommend a guy for our coaches to look at if he is not tough. When I say tough, I mean the tougher the challenge, the better he plays. We want a kid who is a competitor. You won't see size on our list. You can't worry about size. In the line, it is a street fight. You don't talk about weight classes in a street fight. It is the same way with the defensive line. You can't tell the guy that you can't fight him because he is out of your weight class. You can work harder than anybody else to get better. You can go to the weight room and work on your strength. You can work on your hand and foot quickness. The game of football is played with the hands. If you have a guy with quick hands and feet, he can play. We work with martial arts to increase the speed of the hands.

A defensive lineman has to be aware of what is going on around him. He has to shed blockers. He has to be able to change direction effectively. That is important in defensive football. The lineman must stay focused. He has to be able to get off a block. He has to be just downright mean.

In the defensive linemen's meeting room on the left-hand side of the bulletin board is "loyalty and trust." It never comes off the board. We trust each other, and we are very loyal. We never criticize our teammates or talk about them. If I can't trust a player, he is not going in the game. When all the guys are working together, they share that trust in one another. You can't talk out of both sides of your mouth. You have to talk straight.

We evaluate our players. We have a sheet that we use to evaluate them. The strength coach evaluates the players. The trainers and coaches evaluate them. Their academic advisors evaluate them also. We give them a 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 grade. We want to get the winners on the field. These guys control the tempo of the game. They are the ones who can make big plays and turn the game around. If you have a horse, make sure he gets in the race. Make sure the good back gets his hands on the ball. I'm not talking about some prima donna. I'm talking about guys with character who won't get you beat.

There are three types of guys. There are players who are winners, players who won't get you beat, and players who will get you beat. Forget about potential,

 





Page 186

and get them to execute. If you have an excuse player, don't play him. He always has an excuse for why he made a mistake. Don't play him. He'll get you beat.

I give our kids a checklist. Defense is our game, and winning is our aim. That is a catch phase for the defensive linemen. I give them a form. On the form are things that we are going to grade and work on all year long. I have the kids grade themselves. I grade them and write down comments for them.

I give them drills to do over the summer to improve on. It is a job description for them. Included on the sheet are the following: change of direction, stance, alignment, assignment, delivery of a blow, shed, pursuit, tackling, and a good base. We also include backpedal, opposite reaction, explosion, read keys, mental alertness, and second effort. I grade the players every night after practice and give them the sheet the next day.

Next are fundamentals. A player has to move and control his feet. He has to shed the high and low blocks. If a person can shed, he can make plays. Some guys can't get off a block. The tackles have to pass-rush, make tackles, pass-react, pursue, and be tough.

I'm going to talk about stance. We use a three-point stance in the defensive line. If I am teaching a young player a stance, I'll put him in a four-point stance. A four-point stance keeps the lineman down. You can't play with your shoulders turned. You want your pads square and your feet under you. A four-point stance helps the kid to do that. We get into a three-point stance, but 98 percent of our weight is on the ground. We have a slight stagger.

In our alignment we play head up, shade inside and outside, nose up, wide or loose alignment, and gap. We key the ball or anything that moves. If anything moves, we are going.

Our responsibility is whatever defensive technique we are in. I'll cover that later. The reaction is to what the defensive lineman sees. He has to see blocking schemes. He must understand his pass-rush lane. Let's go back to the mechanics of the stance. We don't use a wide base. That will get you in trouble. We want our feet under our hips. I don't say anything about shoulder width. Every kid thinks his shoulders are wider than they are. Good backs run with their feet under the hips. They don't get their feet outside the body. They are skaters. They work within the framework of their hips. When we start to get down, we put our hands on our knees. If I get in a right-handed stance, my right foot is back, and it is my push foot. If I get in a lefthanded stance, it is just the opposite. My knees are bent, and I have some weight on my hands: not too much, but just enough. The off hand is close to the ground. We get in the four-point stance and then pick up the other hand. We are a takeoff team. We read on the run. When the ball is snapped, we take off. In our bent-knee position, we get the power angles we want. We step and explode off the ball.

The first thing we tell our linemen is not to get knocked off the ball. If they get knocked off the ball and back into the linebacker, we can't move. If the lineman is in an outside shade on a guard, his inside hand is down. He steps with the inside foot. By stepping with the inside foot, the lineman can keep his outside leg free. If the stagger is too much, it cause the lineman to rise up. It also doesn't allow him to get into the blocker as quickly as having a shorter stagger. We want to get to the blocker quickly, make contact, punch with the opposite hand, and get off the block.

When the offensive blocker rises up to block, we don't rise up. We strike through him. We learn how to use both right- and left-handed stances. We have to play some techniques that require using the opposite hand down. Make your players line up straight. Your feet determine where the lineman lines up.

When we run drills, we film them. We watch the footwork of the linemen. If they don't step with the proper foot, they get a -3. That is discipline. We do it one way. I never stand behind the defense when we are practicing. I stand behind the offense. I want to see the defensive linemen's eyes. I want to see what they are seeing.

 





Page 187

I want his toes to be straight ahead. I may say, ''Feet!'' That means they are too wide or too narrow. I could say, "Stagger!" That means his stagger is too big or not big enough. If I say, "Tilt," that means their footwork will cause them to get reached.

We do something differently than a lot of people do. I have done this both ways. It doesn't matter what you call techniques, as long as your players know what you are talking about. We letter our gaps. The center-guard gap is the A gap. The guard-tackle gap is the B gap. The tackle-end gap is the C gap. Outside the tight end is the D gap. Head-up the guard would be B. If we want our lineman on the inside eye, that is a B minus. If we want him to straddle the inside leg, that is called tight B. The B plus is the outside eye of the guard. If we get into the B gap, that is called wide B.

We work hard on responsibility. I quiz my players on their assignments. You would be surprised at the number of kids who leave the huddle and don't know the defense or what the snap count is. They don't pay attention in the huddle.

Here is another thing we could talk about anytime. I'm not here to show you alignments, but we'll talk about them. They have to know the alignment, assignment, and reaction. Those things are more important. Never try to tell a kid that the defense will win a game. A scheme is only as good as the players playing it. Execution wins games. The front does not win games.

People ask us about flip-flopping people. We have done both at Penn State. If you don't flip your people, the guy playing on the right gets to play the trap the same way all the time. He uses the same steps and footwork all the time. But if you flip the guy playing the trap, he has to learn both ways, and it adds to the assignments he has to learn. If you flip your people, you have to worry about jumps. If they are flipping, they have to get set in their alignment. If you don't flip, all they have to do is get ready to play. We don't flip our people anymore.

We run a drill about three times a week called "early work." We take our inside people. We work best on best and run traps, reach, scoops, and cutoff blocks. We do this drill before practice. After we work on those things, we put the offense and defense together and work seven on seven.

Let's get into the practice schedule and what we do on the field. Nothing fancy goes on out there. The first thing we do is stretch. I work with the snappers and kickers, but they do their stretching on their own. We work on our flexibility. The guys may be big, but the game is played with bent knees. I think we take too much time from practice to stretch. I tell them to get stretched out. I don't care when they do it, walking across campus on the way to practice or coming out to practice, but I'm not going to take practice time for them to stretch. You hope they don't do this, but it could happen. A guy gets into a fight. He can't say, "Hey, John, wait five 5 minutes; I've got to stretch and get loose." We get loose during our drill work.

The first drill we do is a bag drill. They step over the bags and stretch. At the end of the bags, I have them do some kind of football-related finish. The first time, I may have them recover a fumble. The second time, I may roll the ball, and they have to pick it up and score. The third time, I may throw the ball to them. The fourth time, they have to tip it to someone else. Then I may have someone there to form tackle. There are all kinds of things that you can do during the warm-up period.

There are ways to recover a fumble. If you are not getting done what you want to get done, keep your players after practice and make them do it right. When you are trying to recover a fumble, never get on your back. Grab the ball, lock it down with the arms, and pull up the knees and hips. When they come in on the ball, if they don't bend their knees, they'll kick the ball. We work on this every day.

You can make your players bend their knees and run quickly over the bags. To teach our kids to bend their knees, we do a drill called hand-touch knee bends. The player gets his butt down and face up, bends his knees, and puts his hands on the ground. We run three or four players at a time. We start them out with their feet straight up the field. You can't push off and have good

 





Page 188

acceleration and power with your feet out to the side. We start them running. When I yell "touch," they touch their hands to the ground then. They don't run two or three steps and then touch. In a game, your reaction is not when you want it. It is when it occurs. On defense, you have to gain ground on every move. After the touch, they come out low, hard, and accelerating. When a player comes out high, he is not gaining ground. Whatever drill you do, make sure they are gaining ground on the first step. I don't tell them to go. They touch and go.

Every day we do stance-and-starts. We put them in their stance and make them come out low and hard. We tell them which foot to move first. We emphasize elbows in tight and pumping. We are looking for explosion.

We do a grass drill to teach players how to fall. If you feel yourself fall, what do you do? You put your hands down to break your fall. If you fall and want to get up quickly, you use your and hands and feet. We teach our kids how to fall. You have to get up on the way down. We do this drill. They start to chop their feet. I say, "hit." They hit the ground, get their hands and feet under them, and come up running. Make them get up and down two to three times and make them tackle to finish the drill. This is the second-effort drill. How many times have you seen guys come off the ground to make tackles, sacks, or recover fumbles? I've seen it lots. If a guy can't give us a second move, he can't play for us.

We use this drill for linebackers and down linemen. The first way we teach this drill is in an up position. We teach them how to slide and change directions. You have to be able to defeat the low block. If you can defeat the low block, you can beat the high block. If you are playing the high block and the low block comes, you can't beat the low block because your legs are split. You cannot shed the low blocker. The feet have to stay under the hips at all times. If the feet get outside the hips, the player can't make a second move. If he keeps his feet under his hips, he can go right, left, forward, or backward. The knees have to be bent, and the back foot must be active in the slide. In the change-of-direction drill, the toes have to remain straight ahead. If the toes turn, the shoulders turn. We want the pads parallel. We have three guys in the drill. There are six guys behind them in what we call the bull pen. They are practicing the drill. They are moving their arms and practicing. I say, "switch," and the second line becomes the first line and continues the drill. The third line moves up and practices while they wait for the next "switch" call. You don't become a better player by standing around.

The next drill is the lateral run. We don't slide our feet, we cross over. We don't want a big, wide step. It is a short movement like a carioca step. We keep our toes straight up the field as we cross our feet. My butt is low, and my knees are bent. If we turn our feet, the shoulders turn also. We can't shed anybody or change directions if our shoulders and feet are turned. Don't let them rise up when they change directions. If you do, you will get beat. When your eyes see something, they don't tell you to rise up.

This next drill is not a good drillit is a great drill. We do it every day. We have two long, flat dummies. We have two guys facing each other. One guy is going to his right, and one is going left. They have their hands on the dummies. They slide up and down the dummies. While they are sliding up and down the dummies, they can't take their hands off that bag. When they get to the end of the dummies. They turn and sprint. You can do the same thing with a board instead of a dummy. The main thing is to make them move laterally and keep their hands down.

We take the drill one step further. We have an offensive player and a defensive player. They do the same drill, but as they get to the end of the bag, the offensive player tries to cut the defensive player with a low block. The blocker is trying to get to the knees of the defensive player. The defensive player has to keep his hands down and shed the blocker. If the defensive player gets to the end of the dummy and rises up, he is blocked. We work on movement, shedding, and keeping down. We slide down with the toes straight and then cross over with the toes straight, always keeping our hands on the bags. It makes them bend their knees and stay down.

 





Page 189

We look hard in our game films for guys who do these drills in actual game situations. This drill is one you can find all the time. That is why it is so good. We set up a series of bags and make the linemen step over the bags using the form they worked on in the hands-down drill. They step over the bags going right and left. At the end of the bags to the right and left, we have a tackling lane with a ball carrier. We go through movement, change direction, see the ball carrier, explode up into the lane, and make the tackle.

This next drill is a million-dollar drill that you can get on credit. Go down to the hardware store. Buy some rubber tubing, and make a circle. Even when you pass-rush, you have to maintain good body position. We put two guys across the circle from one another, one in a right-handed stance and one in a left-handed stance. On movement, they run around the circle. They have to keep the hands down on the tubing. They have to lean to stay on the circle. The head is up, and the knees bent. When they get all the way around, they change directions and go the other way. This gives them the idea about coming around the horn in the pass rush. It teaches them to lean in and make the play on the quarterback instead of running past him.

Bill Sexton

The FSU Offensive Package

Florida State University

Thank you. I'm going to get started and cover as much of our package as I can. Every year when we start spring training, we start in the I formation. We start in the I formation, run the football, and throw the playaction pass. Once we get that established as well as we can, we go to split backs, with two wide receivers and a tight end. From that we are going to throw and run the ball as well as we can. Then we go to three wide receivers, no tight end, and two backs. From there we progress to four wide receivers, no tight end, no fullback, and one tailback. I'm going to touch briefly on each one of these personnel groups. If I have time, I'll mention something about our goal line and shortyardage package.

We have come to the conclusion that we have to be diversified in college football. We cannot be a onedimensional football team. We have to be able to run and throw the ball. That is what we strive for every spring and fall.

We want to be able to do equally well, whether we are in the I, split-backs, or one-back set. We don't want to give a defense an advantage by personnel group. We don't want the defense to know what we are going to do from a certain set. The same is true of the formation we are in.

Each spring, we start in the I formation, and the first play we try to establish is the toss sweep. We have been blessed with some great tailbacks. The tailback for us has to be a multidimensional player. He has to be a runner first and a pass receiver second. In the I formation, we put him 8 yards deep. One great thing about the I formation is that it gives the I back a chance to see the field. He is 8 yards deep with his shoulders square to the line of scrimmage, and he is in a twopoint stance. He has the chance to use his God-given ability of vision to run where they aren't.

The fullback's feet are at 5 yards. That puts his hands down at approximately 4 yards from the tip of the football. Our splits are two feet between the center, guard, and tackle. We have a three-foot split between the tackle and tight end. If the ball is in the middle of the field, our wide receiver's split will be halfway between the hash mark and the sideline.

I'll draw up an eight-man front to show you this play. More and more people are starting to crowd the line with their safeties. They are getting their safeties involved in run support. That is another reason to be diversified and not run the ball every time. We always put our tight end on the defensive end, no matter what technique he is. The tight end blocks the defensive end in the 6, 7, 9, or wide 9 technique. He takes his steps according to where the defensive end is aligned.

If the tight end has an inside shade, he takes an inside zone step. He squares his hips and tries to knock the defensive end back off the football. We try to establish a new line of scrimmage. The tackle always blocks the defensive tackle. It doesn't matter if he is a 3, 4-eye, 4, or leverage technique. He wants to prevent the tackle from spinning back into the play. He knocks him upfield as much as he can. The tight end and tackle need to get squared up as much as they can so that they can knock their men back toward their goal line as opposed to knocking them down.

The guard pulls and looks for the run support. He tries to cut the outside hip of the strong safety. If the strong safety comes up on the line and blitzes, the tight end gives the guard an alert call. The guard knows the strong safety is blitzing and kicks him out. Also, the tailback can see that.

The center has the strong A gap. He gets a full scoop into that gap. The split-side guard hard-scoops the knees of the 1-technique shade tackle. The split tackle comes hard inside for the backside B gap. We flip-flop our offensive line. We have a tight guard and tackle, and a split guard and tackle.

 





Page 191

The backside 5 technique is controlled by the naked bootleg. With every run we have at Florida State, we have a naked bootleg. The split end releases hard inside for the free safety. If he can't get him, he turns back on the off corner. We have a three-step read for our flanker, or what we call the Z receiver. He is reading the corner and free safety. If the free safety comes, he cracks on him. If the free safety stays back and the corner hangs, he blocks the corner. If the corner comes in a hard corner or cloud coverage, he blocks the corner.

The tight guard pulls up the alley. The fullback's initial takeoff point is the inside leg of the tackle. That is strictly a takeoff point. He starts toward the inside leg of the tackle until the guard clears. From there, he tracks the onside linebacker. The fullback probably will find the linebacker in the 7-technique area. If the linebacker has a blitz on, the fullback finds him and chops his outside hip. If you can get the linebacker on the ground, it is easier for the tailback to get to the next level. When you block them high, they have a better chance to come off and make the play.

The tailback takes a lateral flow step or hitch step so that the fullback can clear. The quarterback takes the snap, seats the ball in his belly, reverse-pivots, and pitches the ball to the tailback. The tailback concentrates on catching the ball. The secret here is not to get in a hurry. He wants to let the blocks develop. The guard and tailback key the tight end's block. In this case, the guard goes outside the tight end who is coming down on the 7 technique.

The tailback takes a flow step and heads downhill. We want him coming toward the line, not laterally. The tailback sees the down block on the 7 technique and bounces the play outside. The play now depends on the blocks of the guard and fullback.

Let me draw this up against a leverage front, or 50 front. A lot of people don't think this is a good play against this kind of defense. We played Texas A&M in the 1991 Cotton Bowl. They ran this type of defense. They had the noseguard in a 1 gap, a defensive tackle in a 5 technique, and a defensive end in a 9 technique. To the back side, they were in a 1, 2, or 3 on the guard. They played hard corners with the safeties free. We had a tailback who became the MVP in that game. He gained almost 180 yards rushing. We ran the sweep 15 or 16 times on a cold, rainy, sleety afternoon in Dallas, Texas. The defense has leverage in the 5 and 9 techniques. The tight end and tackle have their work cut out for them. They have to block players who already have them outflanked. They take a small zone step and cross over with their next step to the crotch of their assignment. They have to knock them back. They entangle their blocks and knock them back at whatever angle they are.

The tackle and tight end take the outside arm and punch through to the outside number of the defender. They grab the inside number of the defender and turn him. They have to accelerate their feet. We talk about two things in blocking. We talk about the initial lick or contact and accelerating the feet on contact. We get physical with our feet. The man who accelerates his feet on contact wins the battle.

The tight guard pulls and reads the tight end. He is still on the strong safety but reads the tight end. If he doesn't see the numbers on the tight end's jersey, he goes around him. If he can see the numbers of his jersey, he pulls inside the tight end to get the strong safety.

The center has to scoop hard to block the shade gap player. We have had good centers at Florida State, but we have had average centers who could handle a 1 and 2 technique. It is hard, but still they can do it. Unless you are playing against a totally dominating football player, that block is not as hard as it seems. If the noseguard moved all the way to a 3 technique, the tight guard would give a "stay call." That means he stays in and blocks the 3 technique. The tailback will have to make a move on the strong safety. We block the line of scrimmage first. We want to block the inebackers second and the safeties third. You can't

 





Page 192

block them all. The tailback knows that. He has to outrun them, run over them, or make them miss. If he can't do that, we need to go recruiting again. The split guard and tackle are scooping hard. The 5 technique is held by the naked-bootleg threat of the quarterback.

The fullback aims for the tackle's inside leg. He blocks the linebacker. The only way he will block the linebacker inside the tight end is if he is on a blitz. The fullback lets the guard clear and tracks the inside linebacker. He usually goes into the same hole as the guard. He junction-blocks the linebacker. If the defensive end runs out to the sideline, the success of this play is whether the tackle and fullback can make their blocks. It is still a very good football play.

The tailback takes his flow lateral step. He runs downhill, keying the block of the tight end. The tailback generally hits up inside the end. If the defensive tackle is playing super-hard leverage, the tailback comes inside his block. When that happens, the success of the play is dependent on the blocks of the center and backside guard. I've seen plays where the defensive tackle and end skated hard to the sideline. The tailback turns the ball up inside for a good gain.

Your most powerful blocking position is when the defender is lined straight up on you. Your hips and his hips are aligned, and that is where most of your leverage comes from. When a defender has leverage, the blocker tries to take some kind of position step to square up his hips so he can knock the defender back off the ball. The first step is the short zone step. The crossover is the power step. When the blocker can cross over, he can deliver the blow.

Probably the next most frequent defense we face is the 4-3 defense. Now you are faced with a little different problem. By alignment, 4-3 teams take their defensive end and align him in a "ram technique." They align their defensive end at a 45-degree angle and run him through the V in the neck of the tight end. They have the tight end really outflanked. When we get a 4-3 defense, the first thing we have to do is get the wide receiver in the blocking scheme. We signal him to crack on the first safety inside. In the 4-3 defense, they have taken their linebackers and shifted strong. They shift the front to the weak side.

The tight end takes a drop step to square his hips and turns out on the defensive end. The wider the defensive end is, the more of a drop step he has to take. He probably can't hook the defensive end, but he can in certain situations. What he is trying to do is knock him back at the angle he is charging. The tight end does not want to absorb the blow. He attacks the defensive end. He wants to create as much distance between the end to the defensive tackle as he can.

The tackle blocks the tackle. He blocks down on the 3 technique and tries to knock the tackle back at an inside angle. The guard pulls inside the end for the Sam linebacker. The fullback comes off the tackle's leg and turns inside for the Mike linebacker. The reason we do that is because the center can't block the Mike linebacker on that fast-flow play.

The center, split guard, and tackle are hard-scooping on the backside. The tailback sees a wide 9 technique. He takes a lateral flow step and heads downhill at the butt of the tight end. Seventy-five percent of the time, he ends up going inside the tight end's block. The further the tight end can knock the defensive end off the ball, the more alleys the tailback has to run the ball.

This play has been outstanding for us on the goal line. I'll draw it up against a 6-2 defense. There are some people who don't like to pitch the ball on the goal line. We have not had a problem with that. We coach our men to catch all pitches with eyeball concentration. This is not a fast play. The tailback takes his flow step

 





Page 193

and catches the ball before he runs with it. This gives the read and blocks a chance to develop. We can run this from two tight ends and be in a situation where we can run it both ways. The 6-2 defense will be a leverage-type defense. The defense is aligned in 1, 5, and 9 techniques to both sides of the ball. One of the toughest things about running this play in short-yardage situations is that the defense can get more people to the ball than you can block. This is a play where you can give the ball to a great back and give him a chance. There is a leverage player in the 5 and 9 technique. Defenses like to pinch in short yardage. This is a great play against that stunt. The closer you get to the goal line, the tighter the defense gets. This play is a great play on the 1-yard line. Especially if you can run a little inside zone play to the fullback or the quarterback sneak.

The play that helped our short-yardage offense is the quarterback sneak. When you can run that play, the defense has to tighten up inside. That lets you run the sweep on the goal line. The guard's rule doesn't change. He pulls for the support. If they play bump and run on the goal line, we tell the wide receivers to outside-release and run to the back of the end line.

If they play a zone, the wide receiver has to block the corner. The center hard-scoops the strong A gap. The fullback aims at the inside leg of the tackle. He lets the guard clear and tracks the inside linebacker. The backside is in a full scoop. That includes the second tight end. The tailback has the same read as he did on the previous defense. He reads the 9 technique.

We are blessed with outstanding athletes at Florida State. We take our plays and break down their averages. We know what they average in short yardage as well as the open field. The toss sweep averaged between 6.5 and 8 yards a carry. That is a play you can hang your hat on. This is a play that we will establish.

The next play is the sprint draw. This play averages between 6.5 and 8 yards a carry. Let's start with the eight-man front. The tight end's rule is to release on the outside support when the tackle is uncovered, unless he gets a 4-3 call. The tight tackle blocks the defensive end. The tight guard blocks the 3, 2, or 1 technique. The techniques they are going to use will look like the sprint-draw pass. They are going to show their pads. They try to lift the defensive men out of their shoes and short-step them off the ball. That is the same technique we use in our sprint-draw protection.

The center and split guard combination block the defensive tackle and backside linebacker. The center squares his hips, knocks the tackle over to the guard, and gets off on the inside linebacker.

We want the defensive linemen to think 
pass. 
The split tackle pass-sets, engages the defensive 5 technique, and tries to run him upfield. If we can get them rushing upfield, this is a great play. The split end releases for the rover. If the rover is on the line, he goes up on the free safety. We can establish the sprint-draw pass, and it makes this play really go.

Let's draw it up against the leverage defense. The defense is in a 9, 5, and 1 technique to the tight side. They are 3 and 5 technique to the split side. The tight end and tackle have the same blocking technique. He shows his pads to the defensive end, engages him, and runs him up the field. If the defensive end sets on the line, the tight end short-steps out, engages him, and drives him off the ball. The tight tackle shows his pads, engages the defensive tackle, and works him upfield.

 





Page 194

We want a running lane inside. When the tailback hears the tackle-technique call, he knows he is going inside. He has to feel the blocks of the linemen and run to daylight. We don't want him running the ball outside to the tight side. A tailback can't start downhill with his pads square to the line and beat a leverage player to the outside. The fullback climbs the Sam linebacker. He takes him down the middle, not to the side. We are not thinking inside or outside with his block. We don't want an edge player.

The fullback fires through the hole. When he gets 2 to 3 yards from the linebacker, he widens his base from a staggered run to short steps. He becomes an offensive lineman. He gets his shoulder pads down on his knee, with his cage up. We hit with the face mask and shoulder pads up. He brings his hands up and tries to lift the linebacker out of his shoes. He hits him as hard as he can, accelerates his feet, and drives him off the ball. If the Sam linebacker is sticking his nose in there and making it tough on us, we fake the ball in there and throw the pass behind him.

The center and tight-guard block make the combination block on the noseguard and Mike linebacker. The tight guard blocks down on the noseguard with the center. The center comes off for the Mike linebacker. The split guard and tackle show their pads on the line of scrimmage. Hopefully, they get a pass rush from the 3 and 5 technique. They engage and drive them past the ball.

The split end drives hard on the corner and blocks him. The flanker does the same thing.

Against the 4-3 defense, this is an outstanding play. As Coach Bowden says, you can blind-call the sweep. We want to limit our running game. We are very sophisticated in the passing game. But we are as simple as we can be in the running game. We are going to have a lot of passes. That does not mean we deemphasize the running game. It only means that we have more people involved. We want to simplify the running game to the point where the linemen and backs are doing a few things but doing them well. The tight end shows his pads and tries to force the defensive end wide or downfield.

The tight tackle and guard come hip to hip and roadgrade the 3 or 4-eye technique back into the Mike linebacker. They work a combination for the 3 technique and Mike linebacker. The center and the split guard are doing the same thing with the 1 or 2-eye technique. They combination-block for the tackle and Will linebacker. The split tackle sets and works the 5 technique upfield.

This is where the play changes in the 4-3 defense. The difference is the hardball play by the four inside people. There is no pass set. We set on the outside and drive off on the inside. It is a defensive recognition for us and a technique change for the four inside people. That is something we evolved to. It became a better play when we did it.

The fullback isolates on the Sam linebacker. We tell the fullback to block him on his side of the football. We do not want to block him on our side of the football.

We have eight people making the sprint-draw pass look like the sprint draw. If the defense wants to get their safeties involved with run support, we'll beat them with the sprint-draw pass. If the defense commits safeties to run support, the wide receivers are in man coverage. What else could you want in the passing game?

 





Page 195

Let me show you the weak-side sprint draw. It is a combination hardball play and a pass set. The number situation against the eight-man front doesn't look good, but we've had a lot of success with this play. We get a "rover call." That identifies the defense for us. The rover call puts the fullback on the rover. The center knows that on a rover call he works with the split guard to push the 2 technique up into the playside linebacker.

The tight guard and tackle do not scoop. The tight tackle tries to get his hip square on the 3 technique. The tight guard chips up on the backside linebacker. The tight end cuts off the 7 technique. The unblocked man is the strong safety. The tailback is looking to run on the outside leg of the split guard. It has the potential on a heavy 5 technique to break outside. On the back side, we are trying to get square, not cut off. We want to have the ability to cut back to these blocks. The tight end takes an inside zone step and squares his pads on the 7 technique. He tries to push that man upfield because the ball could break back to him.

Against the leverage defense to the strong side, this is an outstanding play. The tight end and tackle short-step, square their hips, and work the defensive tackle and end back downfield. The tight guard and center combination-block the 1 technique back into the Sam linebacker. The split guard and tackle short-step and work their men back. The fullback runs through the A or B gap to block the Mike linebacker. The tailback has a different look from the eight-man front. There is a natural alley outside the 5 technique. He wants to get out there if he can. If the 5 technique plays too heavily on the tackle, the tailback takes the outside alley. I've seen the play break back in to a little home-run alley created by the overplay of the Sam linebacker. If we get the noseguard blocked, that is a great alley.

Quickly, let me put up the 4-3 defense. It is blocked like the strong-side play. We hardball with the split guard and center into the Mike linebacker. The tight guard and tackle do the same thing with the defensive tackle into the Sam linebacker. The fullback leads up on the Will linebacker. The tailback takes the play to the daylight. He has the natural alley outside the 5 technique on this defense also. The tight end shows his pads and runs the defensive end past the ball.

The next personnel grouping we work into is the three-wide receiver group. It is a strong passing formation. We take a 250-pound tight end out of the game and replace him with another fast receiver. Now, you can really penetrate the field with three great speed guys. You can get vertical and run curl-flats and flood routes. It also gives you the ability to run the football on the defense. The defense has to make a decision. The defense has to take one of their linebackers from the inside and walk him out to try to disrupt one of those wide receivers. If you get a six-on-six in the box, you are in good shape. We try to run the isolation to both sides.

Our third wide receiver blocks the walked-off linebacker. The tight tackle short-steps his defensive tackle. The tight guard and the center work a hardball combination on the noseguard to the backside linebacker. The split guard and tackle short-set the 3 and 5 techniques. The fullback isolates the first inside

 





Page 196

linebacker. It is the same steps as our sprint draw. The aiming point is the outside leg of the tight guard. From there, the tailback runs to daylight.

When the tailback sees seven in the box instead of six in the box, he knows there is no cutback for him. The play becomes a strictly play-side run. We have to leave one guy unblocked. We leave the man who is the farthest away from the point of attack.

The play to the weak side looks like the schemes we ran with the sprint draw to the weak side. They are primarily the same play.

The outside play from this set is the toss sweep. We crack on the inside linebacker with our slot receiver. We reach and overblock with our line. The fullback blocks on the support. The tailback flow-steps as he did on the downhill play, but he is trying to get wide on this play. There is no tight end, therefore there is no read. This is a full-fledged sweep to the sideline. The tight guard is overblocking on the inside linebacker. If the linebacker runs through, the guard blocks him. If he doesn't, the slot back cracks him. The wide receiver three-step-reads the corner. If it is a hard corner, he blocks him. If the corner retreats, he cracks the strong safety.

I'm out of time, but I would like to show one pass before I go. Our goal every year is to average 200 yards rushing. As you can see, we don't have many plays. We run sprint draw, isolation, sweep, and the reverses off those plays. Our goal in the passing game is 250 yards. We are trying to get to 450 yards of total offense. If we can minimize turnovers, we can win most games. The big thing that we are doing out of the I is the sprint-draw pass. We had Bill Parcells down for a visit about 10 years ago. I asked him, If he could run only one pass against all defenses in pro ball, what would it be? This is what he showed us.

This play has been outstanding for us for years. People call this a dig route. The tight end releases upfield at 10 yards and works inside off the linebacker. If it is man coverage, he separates from him. If it is zone, he finds the open area. The outside receiver runs the same pattern at 16 yards. The fullback blocks as if he is running the sprint draw. The tailback fakes and comes through the line. He runs an out at 3 yards.

The quarterback sets 9.5 to 10 yards behind the tight guard. We want the linemen to keep their pads square. It is not a turn protection. The linemen must remain square as long as they can.

If the free safety comes up on the 16-yard dig or 12-yard tight end's pattern, we are going downtown. We try to hit the post cut to the split end. If the free safety hangs deep, we come to the strong-side linebacker area. If the linebacker flies out of there, we deal the football to the tight end right now. If that window is closed, we look for the 16-yard pattern. That pattern takes a little longer to run. If it is not open, we go to the last read, which is the back in the flat.

Punting Drills and Techniques

Mississippi State University

It is a pleasure being here. I know this morning is kind of early for some of you guys. I see of lot of coaches here who are taking notes and seem to be organized. It is important to be organized. I went to speak at Coach Bryant's clinic in Alabama one year. I talked to them about being organized. That reminds me of a story.

This fellow was extremely organized. He wrote down in his notebook everything in every category. He got a visit one day from a guy who was inquiring whether he had been in Louisville on the 21st of February. The guy got out his notebook and began flipping through it. He looked under the category marked ''cities'' and told the fellow that he was in Louisville on the 21st. The fellow asked him if he was there on the 21st and 22nd. The guy looked in his book under "dates." He found out he was there on those dates. The fellow then asked him if he was at a Coach of the Year Clinic. The guy looked in his book under "clinics." He told the fellow that he was. The fellow asked him if he stayed at the Galt House Hotel. He looked under "hotels." He told the fellow that he certainly did. The fellow then ask him if he went to a place called O'Malleys. The guy looked under "watering holes." The answer again was yes. The fellow asked him if he met a lady named Mary. He looked under "names." Yes, the guy had met a lady named Mary. The fellow than asked if he spent the night with her. The guy looked under "entertainment." His answer was yes. The fellow jumps out of the chair and says, "Damn it, I don't like that; she was my wife." The guy looked in his book under "opinions." He told him, "You know, I didn't like it either."

Let's move along, and let some of these guys get in here. I'm going to spend some time this morning and go through the kicking game. But I'm also going to talk about the lost art of actually punting the ball. I remember the first job I had as a head coach. I was setting up the staff and doing all the little things. I asked my staff who could coach the punters. There wasn't a person on my staff who could coach the punter. At that time, we had a player that was a great punter. He was an All-Pac-10 punter. I decided to be the kicking coach. I wasn't going to let anybody screw him up.

Great players teach us a lot more than we can actually teach them. Over the years of coaching punters and kickers, I have derived some things. Ever since then, I get every book that comes out on the kicking game. It pleases me to know that what I have been teaching the punter was in all those books. The techniques remain the same. In the very short time today, I will be able to teach you how to teach your kids to punt. That doesn't mean they will be able to punt. That takes a certain amount of ability.

I have developed the four P's for punters. You 
prepare 
a young man to do something. You 
practice 
hard at it. You 
position 
him to do something that he has to 
perform. 
If he can't perform, you are not going to be able to do it.

Since the guys are still coming in and we are in Louisville, Kentucky, that reminds me of a guy who had just won the lottery. He went to a financial advisor. The advisor told him the hottest thing to invest his money in was race horses. It had the greatest returns on his money. He bought a race horse. The racing season was over in the United State, so he sent the horse to run on the European circuit. The first time his horse ran, he got a telegram. It says, "SSFF." He looked at the telegram and says, "Started second, finished first." He was excited. The horse was on the way back, so the guy decided to get a brass band and meet the trainer and horse. When the trainer got off the boat to the playing of the brass band, he looked at the owner and asked him if he had gotten his telegram. The owner said, "Yes, started second, finished first." The trainer said, "Hell no! He started, stumbled, farted, and fell."

I collect quotes. I have about 500 or so, and I'm going to give you a few of them. "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail." We all talk about this. It is spring, and it's time to get ready for spring practice. The quote I keep on my desk is, "I'm third." We all know who is first. One thing that I tell our coaches is that if our players don't come above a lot of things in their personal life, I won't have them around. If you are going to be a coach, the most important thing you have to understand is that ''players winyou don't." If you want to have a job and be a successful coach, you better make sure that you end up doing what you have to do to develop those players. You need to have a good relationship with them, because they do come first in a lot of things. "Life is in sessionare you present?'' We all go through life. The older we get, sometimes we don't feel that.

"Happy are those who dream dreams and are willing to pay the price to make them come true." We all have dreams. At our clinic this year in Florida, I probably had more former players who are now coaches than any other coach there. I draw these three circles on the board all the time. One is for wishing, the other is wanting, and the third is doing. It is important to make your players understand that everybody is wishing and wanting, but very few people are doing. I take it a step further and draw a little circle inside the "doing" circle. That means the people inside the circle are doing it 24 hours a day.

We all have to do things with our football team to help them understand. I want you to write this down. I want you to write down "14 days." I want you to circle that. Years ago in the 1960s, there was a boom of people going around giving motivational talks. They would get two to three thousand people going to a clinic. These people would come out of those clinics and were going to beat the world. They would go to an insurance seminar. They would come out of that meeting ready to go sell a million dollars of insurance. It got really expensive, and a lot of people began running those clinics. There is one guy on the west coast who is good, but he charges $20,000 for a 30-minute talk.

I'm going to give you about a $20,000 talk in about 15 seconds. You won't remember what you hear here for an average of 14 days if it is not a part of you. If it is not part of your philosophy or understanding, you won't remember what was said here. It is the same way with your players. It doesn't make any difference what you tell your players as long as it's part of them.

I want to play a coach who jumps on a table, screams, and hollers before a game. He tries to get his players so fired up that they want to tear the locker-room door off. The emotion lasts until the first play. When the guy across from him slaps the crap out of him, he doesn't care what the coach said in the locker room. What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter what any of us say. Unless you are willing to take it in and digest it to where it becomes a part of you, whatever we say is going to last about 14 days.

In the third circle on "doing," I would put names and leave it on the board. Every few days, I would put a name in there of someone who was actually doing it. He was doing whatever you asked him to do. Then I would take the circle, tighten it down, and put some more players in there. You are not going to have but a few players on your football team who do it 24 hours a day.

"We are not often what we think we are, but we think we are." When you think about things and talk to players about them, make sure your players are on the same wave length that you are.

I like this one very much. It fits all of us. "Take out your brain and jump on it. It gets all caked up." We think that we are really intelligent. Age make you wiser sometimes, but sometimes it makes you dumber. When I was a young coach, I spent a lot of time going to clinics. I took my summers as a young coach to go visit schools. I went to Texas A&M, Texas, Houston, and Oklahoma all in one summer. The reason I did that was because the wishbone was the popular offense in the country. Being a defensive coach, I wanted to understand the wishbone from the offensive side, so I could stop it.

"When the little bird tells you something, make sure it is not a cuckoo." Don't start or believe rumors. I have a rule. I do not respond to the third party. I am probably

 





Page 199

the most-publicized guy in college football over the last 10 years. I'll give you a good example. When I was at Texas A&M, we had this guy who was worth $800 million. He was the chairman of the board. The newspaper kept going to him because he took credit for hiring me. He didn't hire me; I came for some other reason. But he took the credit, and the newspapers would talk to him. Every time he would say something, they would come to me for a comment. I would tell them that I would not respond to that question. They would ask me in 20 different ways, trying to get me to respond. I finally told the newspaper guy to go get the chairman, bring him into this room, and I'll respond to your question. You will find that will never happen.

"You cannot leave footprints in the sands of time by sitting on the beach." You need to write this one down because it is really true: "The road to success is always under construction." Here is another one that really applies to athletics: "It is better to fail at something than to succeed in doing nothing." This is probably my favorite one: "If you must cry over spilt milk, condense it.'' We all have problems. It is our responsibility to convince the players that their problems are not as big as they think they are.

The thing that I'm concerned about in high school these days is the resurgence of pot smoking. I've studied in the Arizona drug-testing committee. They put drug testing in college programs. I was the first coach in college football to test all our players. I believe in it, and I've saved a lot of players' lives from crossing over that line. Research tells us that it is being grown inside under lights and is two to three times more powerful. If you don't or can't test your players, you need to be constantly aware of what is going on. Players cannot play and perform if they are doing those things.

I am here for you, so stop me at any time if you want to ask a question. When we talk about motivation and how to motivate people, that is a misused term. The more mature players you have, the better football team you are going to have. I've been around probably the best college team ever as far as talent. Every player from our starting 22 played pro football. On the 1980 team that I had in Pittsburgh, we had 27 players; 3 were drafted in the first round, 11 in the first seven rounds, 18 others got drafted, and 22 went to camp. We went through a span of four years where we went 11-1. If it hadn't been for the dumb-butt coaches, we probably would have won the national championship at least two times. Coaching is just like the Kentucky Derby. All the horses in the Kentucky Derby have a chance to win, or they wouldn't be there. All those horses can run.

What is motivation? The best example I can give you is playing for Coach Bryant. There was no coach in college coaching like Coach Bryant. He forgot more about winning than we will ever know. We were playing Tennessee. It was fourth down, and we had the ball on their 4-yard line. Coach Bryant had me by one arm and David Ray, our kicker, by the other arm. He sent us on the field. Suddenly from the press box someone yelled, "Clock play." Stabler came up to the line on fourth down and threw the ball out of bounds. He stopped the clock, but we lost the ball on downs. The game ended in a tie.

We went back to our locker room after the game. The manager had left the keys to the padlock on the door out on the field. Coach Bryant knocked the lock off the door, and we all filed into the locker room. About that time, all the coaches started coming in. Coach Bryant told all the coaches to get out of the "damn locker room!" Here we were in the locker room with Coach Bryant. He told us that in all his years of coaching, this was the first time he, as the coach, had lost a football game. He always talked to the press. That day he left the locker room, talked to no one, got in the police car, and left. He usually had a meeting with his coaches on Sunday morning to find out who played well. That meeting didn't happen.

On Monday morning, all the coaches were sitting around the big conference table in his office. They were all early because that is the way Coach Bryant wanted it. He looked at his watch and said that he was five minutes early, but he wanted to get started anyway. We were playing LSU the next week, and they had a great football team. He told all his coaches if we didn't beat LSU to pack their bags. He didn't talk to any of them for a whole week and never had another staff meeting. We went to play LSU and won 35-6.

 





Page 200

They scored the 6 at the end of the game. That's motivation.

Let's talk about the punter. There are two types of punters. There is the slicer and the conventional type. You do not want a slicer. If you are a slicer, you can't control the ball.

Let's talk about the grip of the ball. There are four panels on the football. It doesn't matter how you number the panels. I start with the one to the left of the strings as you hold the ball. A right-footed kicker's right thumb goes on the first panel of the ball. The index finger and middle finger go on the second panel. The ring finger and little finger go on the third panel. On a Wilson football, there is a trademark. It's a circle with an R in it. When I talk about the dot, that is what I'm talking about.

The ball sits in the fingers. Don't palm the ball. It is just as for the quarterback: I want to see air under the fingers. We want the ball back in our fingers so that we can drop the ball down to our side and be able to hold it. It is almost a natural placement of fingers on the ball. I want to be able to place the ball in my fingers and walk, talk, or swing the ball. That means I've got the right pressure on the fingers and no pressure on the palms. Have your punter drop his hands to his sides. Walk up and place the ball in his right hand. It automatically goes in the proper place.

Don't put the ball in the fingertips. To hold the ball in the fingertips, you have to squeeze it with the hand. If you squeeze it with the fingers, you have no control over it. Also, if you squeeze with the fingers, your elbow will go inside, and we certainly don't want that. I have them grip the ball. If I can place my fingers on the ball and take it away from him, he doesn't have control of the ball. If the punter puts the ball in his palm, it is easy to take away from him. The grip is on the back third of the ball.

If he grips the ball, swings it up to the middle, and extends his left hand, that is where it goes. His left hand may be adjusted up on the ball somewhat, but it is a mirror of his right hand. We want a small bend in the back of the kicker. What I am trying to teach you is how to get the ball in the perfect spot every time.

As we swing the ball up and stop it, we can see that the ball is not straight. It is automatically three to five degrees inside and three to five degrees down. If you take the ball in the fingertips, it pulls your wrist and elbow inside, which is not natural.

The next thing is the stance of the punter. We want a parallel stance. That doesn't mean that you won't stagger your stance a little bit. That depends on the punter. We always start off parallel. If the punter is kicking the ball downfield, the only way that can happen is if the body is going downfield. If my hips are pointed outside, I cannot punt the ball downfield. It is impossible to do unless the punter is a slicer. Everything the punter does is going downfield. His shoulders, hips, and feet are all going downfield.

We want no weight on the toe or heel. We want a comfortable stance. We don't want to be leaning forward on the toe. I want a slight bend in the leg. I do not want a straight leg. If the punter is straight legged, that means his butt is out. He wants his butt forward but a slight bend in the legs. We want him to be relaxed in his stance.

The hands are relaxed. When the punter receives the ball, he does not want his hands locked. I don't want those hands extended forward with the elbows locked. I want them relaxed. After he relaxes, he moves his hands up into position. If he locks his hands, that will force him straight up. He has about four inches between his elbow and his body.

The target area for the center snap is just below the chest and just above the crotch. A good drill for the snapper is the one-man sled. Place the sled at the punter's depth, and let him practice snapping the ball at the sled. A lot of people talk about the speed of the snap. It is not speed; it is accuracy. We talk about .7 for the snap.

I've had about five pro coaches call about our punter. I asked them who coaches their punter. The response

 





Page 201

from all five teams was "no one." The most important play in the game is the punt, and no one coaches it. That doesn't make sense to me. They told me that the punters kind of coached themselves. Every day, I spend at least an hour with our punter. That is prepractice, during practice, and after practice. I film every time that he punts the ball. I film two angles. I film from behind and the top. He watches those films every day. I want him to understand in the game if I say, "Drop the ball."

When the punter kicks a bad kick in a game, he does one of two things. He goes over and hangs his head, or he wants to know what happened. You, as the coach, better have something to tell him. You can teach yourself how to coach punters just by watching film.

If the hips are turned to the right or left, the first thing that happens when I step is that my foot is going in the direction of my hips. All of a sudden, my hips are pointing to the right, and I want to kick it to the left. That means I have to slice the ball.

I want the conventional style, where the punter strikes the ball and his foot finishes above his head. I want that finish on the right eye with his foot above his head. That is why I take the film from the top. If I don't see his foot above his head, I know he did not finish the kick. If I see his foot to the left of his shoulder or below, that means he had some bad steps, and his plant foot and body were turned.

To get your punter kicking down the field, draw a chalk line down the field. Just simply make him step down the line. He is stepping down the line and kicking down the line. We want his foot right on that chalk line. If you don't want to use the chalk line, put him in a tunnel. Form a tunnel with dummies or cones. If you have a punter who is crossing over, he will kick the dummies. That will get him out of crossing over more quickly than you know. If you have a punter who is overstriding, pile dummies up in front of him. However, watch him. They want to stop and jerk their knee up when you do that.

There are two drills that I want to show you really quickly. The first drill is called the seat drill. The punter

is on his knees. You can't do this enough. I make our punters do this a thousand times. Have a manager or another punter spin him the ball. The punter catches the ball, seats it, and drops it. They present the ball and drop it. I don't want him to fart around with the ball. The more he adjusts and fiddles with the ball, the less likely he will be a quick kicker. As a punter, you are trying to get your time between 1.3 to 1.5 seconds. I time the punter from the time he catches it until it comes off his foot. If it comes off in 1.6 to 1.7 seconds, the kick is going to get blocked.

During pregame, I watch the opponent's snapper and punter. That is when I decide what we are going to do in punt receiving. I watch the center to see how he presents the ball. I watch the punter to see if he can get it off in 1.5. I check to see how many steps he is taking. I look at the distance it takes him to kick the ball. Most punters are 15 yards deep. If the punter takes more than 5 yards to punt the ball, it will be blocked just about anytime they want to come after it. We can't protect it. That is where I put the dummies to keep the punter from overstepping the 5-yard mark. If the punter can't get the kick off before the 5-yard point, the block point is 7 instead of 9 yards. Even if he can get it off in 2.0 seconds, it will be blocked.

In the seat drill, the punter catches the ball. He grips the ball and presents it. He then drops the ball. If he drops the ball correctly, it will bounce straight up and back to his right. If the nose of the ball is down, it will bounce back to the punter. If the nose of the ball is up, it will go away from the punter. If the ball is turned one way or the other, it will bounce the opposite way from how it is turned. He is not kicking the ball; he can practice these things, and you don't have to be there.

The other drill is called the flex drill. I do this to get the players to understand how to explode through the

 





Page 202

ball and finish. If your player is doing this the correct way, there will be times when he falls right on his butt. His power will take him through the kick. The punter presents the ball as if he were going to kick it. As he presents the ball, the coach or manager takes the ball, but the punter continues his motion as if he were going to kick the ball. When the plant foot is put down, there should be about a 30-degree bend in the knee. The power leg or punting leg will actually be almost touching his butt as he fires up through the ball. As the leg comes from almost touching his butt to the explosion, contact will be made around the knees. This lets the punter experience the full extension of the leg. This is like swinging a weighted bat. He is really going after the ball, but all of a sudden there is no ball there, so he finishes pretty high.

Next, let's look at the placement of the ball on the foot. When the punter's foot is locked and straight, there is only about four inches of the ball that actually makes contact with the foot. That is because the ball is not flat. The ball is dropped on the laces of the shoe. Because it is dropped slightly down and inside, there is more surface to hit.

I am not concerned about the spiral of the ball. I want the ball 40 yards downfield every time it is punted. I don't care if the ball doesn't shoot out like a gun. We would like to have that, but if it doesn't, that is okay. As long as the punter's mechanics are all right, the ball will go downfield 40 yards. If you want the ball to turn over, the punter has to drop the nose of the ball more. By dropping the nose of the ball, the fit on the foot is better, and the angle is better. If the ball is kicked high, the punter is overstriding and has his weight back.

If the ball is kicked to the right, that means the ball is dropped on the outside of the foot. If the ball goes left, the ball was dropped on the inside of his foot. When I watch punters from the front, I can tell you by the way the ball comes off the foot whether it went left or right.

Let me go over some steps for you. Punters are generally a 2-, 2.5-, 3-, or 3.5-step punter. You don't want to be a 3- or 3.5-step punter. If I am a true 2-step punter, I am going right, left, and punt. If I am a 2.5-step punter, I have a jab step to get going. I punt with a right, left, and left step pattern.

[Question] The question was about a bad snap? The first thing that we tell the punter is to get the ball. If the ball is left, he moves his whole body behind the ball. Don't just reach. If we are going to kick the ball downfield, we have to get straight behind the ball. If he doesn't move behind the ball, his momentum will be carried the way the ball is snapped.

Here is a drill to teach a punter how to punt. Get two

punters facing each other about 5 yards apart. Have them play pepper with each other. When I talk about pepper, it is the game you play in baseball. In punting, all you are doing is teaching your punter how to control the ball. Don't worry about the spiral. All I want to do is control the ball. Work on presenting the ball and dropping it. I'm watching the ball. If it goes left, it came off the inside of my foot. If it goes right, it is the outside. It is one step and drop. After we develop some skill with the 5-yard distance, we start to increase the distance apart up to 20 yards.

To make a point, I make the punter close his eyes. With his eyes closed, I make him kick the ball. If he can't do it, his drop is not consistent. He can do it if he steps down the line, has a consistent drop, and swings his leg down the line.

During the seat drill, the punter gets so good that he can stop the ball as it is being snapped to him and not have to make any adjustments to it before he kicks. He has to focus and concentrate on the ball, but his hand-eye coordination will let him do it.

We watch the punter's head. We draw a straight line from his head. As he receives the ball, seats it, and steps forward, his head should not go up and down. It should remain level throughout the approach. As he presents the ball, he does not pull it up or down. If the head goes up on the first step, it means his heel is out. I stand to the right of the punter. As he receives the ball and presents it, if he raises the ball up, I'll slap it out of his hands. The ball is not raised or lowered throughout the kick. They work on the level presentation during the pepper drill also.

 





Page 203

The slicer can spiral the ball, but there is no power. I want to kick with power and forget about the spiral.

Next, I want to cover placement of the ball. A regular kick is one that is kicked straight downfield. If I want to directionally kick the ball, there are some techniques involved. Remember, we want to kick down the line. If the line is a directional kick aimed at the sideline, we still use the same principles. If he wants to kick the ball to the right, the punter moves to the left before the snap. The hips have to be turned to the right sideline. If I'm going to kick it left, I move right before the snap. Our rule is he never moves outside the foot of the center. You see some people line up over the guard. If you do that, you are asking the center for an awful lot. We don't punt outside the tackle box. We never punt outside our guard box.

To get the punters to understand height, I make them kick over light poles. I make them walk up within 10 yards of the pole and kick over them.

When they directionally kick the ball, they need a target. If they punt downfield, there is the scoreboard. When they kick for the sideline, I want them to find a target in the stands. It may be a big section number in the stadium or something like that. He can't see the pylons in the end zones. The kicker's target is in the stands.

The next type of kick is when you are backed up. Never allow the punter to be closer than six inches from the end line. That has to be practiced. The desperation kick is critical in some games. When the punter has a desperation kick, he has one step to kick it. At the end of the game with 11 people rushing is when the punter has a desperation kick. He gets one step to get it away.

The punt formation we use is the spread formation. We have two gunners on the outside to go to the ball. We have two slot backs and a personal protector for the punter.

The kicking look for mismatches is just as if you were looking for a mismatch on offense. If there is a weakness in the kicking game, find it. The punter is just as important as the quarterback. The quarterback gets the chance to throw the ball 20 to 30 times a game. The punter gets six times a game to punt the ball. You have to spend time with him. It is the single most important play in any game you play. Don't take it for granted.

Gentlemen, my time is up. Thank you for your attention.

Running Back Drills and Techniques

University of Nebraska

If you listened to my introduction, you may have noticed that I played fullback at Nebraska. How would you like to be an I back and have me blocking for you? It would be a tough go. I will do everything I can to let you know basically what we are doing drill-wise with our running backs. I will cover the techniques we are teaching and what we are trying to get accomplished with them. Also, I will talk to you about some general things that I think are extremely important in terms of football and winning games.

I have been very fortunate as a coach at Nebraska. I went to Nebraska in 1962. That happened to be the same year that Bob Devaney went there. We started winning when he got there, and we have had a winning season every year since. In our worst two years, we were 6-4, both years.

After I graduated from Nebraska, I got a chance to be the head coach at Holy Name High School in Omaha. I took the job, and without ever coaching a down, I thought I was the best coach that there ever was in the state. I had come through a CYO program in Cleveland, Ohio, where I grew up. Our CYO program there was very successful. Our high school team won the city championship.

I thought I knew everything there was to know about football when I left Nebraska for Holy Name High School. I was very confident when I went into my first game as a coach against what happened to be our arch-rival, Cathedral High School. I gave the team a great pep talk before the game, and I knew we could not lose. We came out on the field and got beat 48-3. It did not take me long to realize that I was not the mastermind of football that I thought I was. I realized that I had a lot of things to learn and a long way to go.

Fortunately, I was around some great people, and I learned a lesson there. If you surround yourself with good people, you are going to have a chance, no matter what you are doing, regardless of whether you are a coach or not. If you surround yourself with good people, as a coach, you will have a chance. If you are a player and you surround yourself with good people and you hang out with good people, you will have more than a good chance.

I was never so dejected in my life as I was after that first loss. I was walking across the field to shake hands with the opposing coach. I had my head down and was asking myself if I was in the right profession. I was wondering how things were going to go for me in the future. About that time, I bumped into a little old lady leaving the game. I said, "Excuse me, ma'am, no offense." She said, "That is right, coach, and you did not have any defense either." That is about the way it was at Holy Name High School. We did not have an offense, and we did not have a defense. We did have a kicking game. We scored 3 points in the kicking game.

At the University of Nebraska, I have been very fortunate to coach in a program where, generally speaking, we have had a good offense, a good defense, and a good kicking game. Can you win the conference championship without all three of those elements? You can, but it is tough to do. Can you win the national championship without all three of those units? You can, but it is very, very tough. We gave it a shot in 1983 against Miami. At that time, our defense was ranked 78th in the country. However, we had a tremendous offense and a tremendous kicking game. We lost to Miami by one point in the national championship game. Other teams may have won the national championship without all three phases of the game. Generally, if you have all three phases, it gives you your best chance. However, having all three phases does not make it automatic.

I want to talk about some things that are very important for all coaches. I feel it would be worthwhile for you to go through a process here that is going to

get everyone in your program moving in the same direction. It will get everyone in your program on the same page. Coach Tom Osborne has our staff sit down at the beginning of the year, and we hammer out a mission statement. This past year, we came up with this statement. It is very short and very concise. We wanted "excellence through teamwork." That is how we wanted to get things done. We wanted to be an excellent team, but we wanted to do it by having everyone working together and by being unified. What we did was to list items under our mission statement that would be the way the coaching staff would operate. We decided that we were going to be hardworking, thorough, professional, and loyal. The coaching profession demands that you be hardworking. If you are not, you are not going to be around very long. The other items are issues that come up during the season. Being loyal is very important. There will be times when you will be tested on this issue. If the defense plays great and turns the ball over to the offense in good position, but the offense cannot take advantage, it can cause some tension between the offensive and defensive coaches. You must be in the game as a team.

Next, under the mission statement, we have a list of governing values. It tells us how we will operate as a staff. We want to promote behavior that reflects well on the university, the football team, and each individual player. We want to promote the character of each player. That is something high school coaches do a great job with. I think we need to do a good job in this area. We all need to visit with our players about things other than X's and O's.

We want to promote unity, pride, unselfishness, and confidence in our team. I think this is very important. I do not care how your team looks on paper in terms of their height, weight, or speed; it makes no difference. If you do not have them unified, if they are not unselfish, and if they are not a confident team, you will not get the job done the way you want it done. You are not going to win as many games as you want to win. I feel that building these aspects on the team are very important.

It is great having the staff all working together and on the same page. But more important is to have everyone who comes in contact with the players going in the same direction as well. What Coach Osborne does, after we have completed our mission statement, is have a meeting with everyone who has any contact with our team, in any shape or form. He gets the equipment managers, trainers, team doctors, strength coaches, ticket office staff, and anyone who comes into contact with our team together in a meeting. He goes over our mission statement with them. He tells them, "This is what the coaches have decided we are going to be all about. This is how the coaches are going to operate this season. We want you to operate in this fashion." Nothing will destroy you more than to have someone in your own organization who is bitching and complaining all of the time. If you have that, you will have a brush fire that will turn into a forest fire immediately. An example would be your trainer taping ankles before practice. He is all upset because the star running back hurt his back doing squats in the weight room. The trainer complains to the other trainers about lifting weights. He has six or seven other players who are waiting in line to be taped. Now, you have a problem, and you may not even know about it. You need to address those issues with everyone involved with your program. Let them know how you want to operate and handle the players. If you can get everyone working on the same page and you have a good offense, defense, and kicking game, you have a good chance of getting the job done.

There are two ways a player can operate. He can say, "What is in it for me? How many touchdowns can I score, how many yards can I gain, or how many tackles can I make?" Or he can say, "How can I contribute to the success of this football team?" The more players who have the second attitude, the better your chances for success.

It doesn't just happen that your team is unified. It does not just happen that everyone is moving in the same direction. You have to work just as hard at this as you do coaching the X's and O's. You have to talk to your players about unity and unselfishness, or else you will

not have it. Coach Osborne has a theme for the week. One week it may be character. He will have posted some quotes from famous people that the players will recognize. Every time we have a team meeting that week, he will talk about the theme for the week. He will start the meeting off by talking about that theme. That is what he starts out talking about that week in all of our team meetings. He starts addressing a lot of issues that are going to be important to your players, now and later, after they are out of the university. He stresses the cohesiveness of the team throughout the year. We have been tested. The last couple of years, we have been tested. We have had a few players get into some trouble. Men, let me tell you, if you have any of your football players get into trouble, it goes coast to coast in a flash. So, our unity and togetherness were tested a great deal the last two years. By addressing the issues, talking about them with your players, and telling them how you expect to operate, I think you have a chance to be successful.

Now I want to talk about the drills that we use with our running backs. These drills have been used over the years. We do not change our drills just because our players get bored. I bore my players to death with the drills we use. We have a very select number of drills that we use, but we get a tremendous number of repetitions on them in practice. Basically, we get daily repetitions on them. I think you can see the carryover value in the games by doing the drills daily. On each drill that I cover, I will show it on videotape, and I will show it to you used in a game film. You will see everything we do drill-wise. Also, I will go over our techniques as far as carrying the ball. I will cover the drills that we use in dealing with one man and the drills that we use when we are dealing with more than one man. Hopefully, I will have time to go over our blocking techniques.

I believe drills are designed for a couple of purposes. One, the drill should fit into what you are doing offensively. They should fit the type of plays you are going to run. I will show you a drill that helped us a great deal on the inside zone play. Another reason for drills is to develop some confidence in your backs about going into contact.

A lot of the players who come to us are ready for contact. They will run into anyone without hesitation. There are some who are not really sure, and they are not confident about the contact phase of the game. We do a lot of close-quarters, one-on-one type of drills. We do these drills at a fairly fast pace, and I feel that the repetitions will help build their confidence in going into contact.

If you are the tailback in our system, you are going to get the ball 25 to 30 times out of the 80 snaps we will have on offense. We can't have that back having any doubt about how he is going to operate in a game. We cannot have a timid player out there carrying the football. There has to be an attitude that is formed. There has to be an attitude that is developed within your backs. There are no collisions like the ones running backs have in football. This is where you get the major collisions. The linemen have collisions from two to three yards apart. But the running backs are going to have major collisions with defenders who have angles on them and are running full speed. There are no collisions like the ones they have. They must develop an attitude that they can perform at a high level. They have to be able to do it game after game and, basically, play after play.

We are trying to develop an attitude and a skill in the drills that we perform. We have a warm-up period at the start of practice. All of our players are out there. They go through a series of things in a 10-yard area. The do the high knees, carioca, and some other warmup-type drills. Then they do some partner stretching drills. After that, all of our players break up into group work.

All of the running backs know to come to the corner of the end zone with me. When they come over, they all grab a ball. Let me talk about that first. They all have a ball in their hands. We have them go over bags with a ball in their hands. The reason I do this is that if they are going to play for us, they are going to carry the ball a lot in the game. If the ball hits the ground, our chances of winning are not very good. I want our running backs thinking good ball technique right at the start of practice.

 





Page 207

Good ball technique to us is this: The finger is over the point of the ball. The elbow is ready to pin the back point of the ball to the rib cage if you are in the open field. If you are sprinting for a score, you can have great arm action. Anytime they are in a dangerous situation or at linebackers' level or stepping over a player, we ask them to roll the ball in front of their breast plate a little. What we are doing is removing the surface of the ball from the defender. Now the defense does not have anything to grab. The linebacker can get his hat on the ball, but it is not going anywhere. You cannot see the ball from behind. We never have two hands on the ball going through the line of scrimmage. We have one hand on the ball. You are not the same back when you run with two hands on the ball as you are with one hand on the ball, where you still have great balance. It is basically the same position or area where you would carry the ball with two hands, but we want only one hand on the ball in front of the chest plate. I can secure the ball here with one hand. I can control the ball from that position. Our backs get confident in this position. I am not going to tell you that every time our backs get the ball, they have the ball on the chest plate or tucked in on the side. Ideally, that is what you want to happen. That is not always going to be the case. We know that, but that is our job, to talk to the backs about good ball techniques. We remind them to roll the ball forward, keep it high and tight, and use some terms that they will be able to identify with. So we always start out our drills working on good ball techniques.

I always watch team work from behind the offense. If I see a lot of the ball from that position or if he is flagging the ball as he comes back to the huddle, I give him some reminders to keep the ball high and tight. I will suggest that they roll the ball forward a little more. I want to make positive remarks to them about ball techniques. I do not want to talk to them in negative terms. They are getting hit up about good ball technique all the way through practice, from the start of practice with drill work all the way up to team work. We were in the top five in the country in turnover ratio this year, and we run an option offense. Two years ago, we were pressing to be number one in turnover ratio in the country. This tells me that we do not put the ball on the ground that much. We take good care of the football. When you are running an option offense, you have a lot of concern about turnovers because there is a lot of risk in running the option game. If your backs start putting the ball on the ground, then you have major problems.

When they come to start the drills, we have 10 rectangular bags that are flat on the ground. The backs come over and get a football. The first thing we are going to do is to step over the bags using good ball technique. This drill takes at the most a minute and one half to go through, but we do not miss a day of this drill. We are going to get three or four things accomplished in this drill.

I had one coach visit our practice. He asked me what we did with our backs in our drills. Before I answered him, he told me that he did not like bag drills. He went on to tell me that he felt they were a waste of time. But I disagree. If you are a basketball player and you go three or four months without bouncing a basketball, you will be rusty when you come back to the game. It is the same as catching a football. If you are used to catching the football 20 to 30 times a day in practice, and then you take a month off, it will not be as natural to catch the football if you take a month off and then come back out to catch those passes. We think running with the football is the same.

We go over the bags every day. We have them go through them three times. First, they step through each bag with one foot. I am not concerned about them getting from point A to point B as fast as they can. I am interested in high knees going over the bags. I am interested in ball techniques as they go through the bags. As soon as they go over that first bag, they get high knees, and that ball gets rolled forward in front of their breast plate. That is a dangerous situation at this point. That ball is high and tight. We are stepping over a man on the ground. I can show you on tape 30 or 40 times a season when our backs have to step over someone. It may be a defender, or it may be one of our players. We are working on ball techniques and high knees.

 





Page 208

As we get the ball up high, our vision is going to be focused down the field. I want them to look downfield and focus in on something. This is where peripheral vision comes into play. I want to see the field. I want to know where people are coming from. We do not want to be looking down at the bags we are stepping over. I want to work on my peripheral vision in the drill.

As they come over the last bag, we have a manager about 8 yards from the last bag. As the back comes over the last bag, he wants to beat the manager with a speed move. He must accelerate hard at an angle to beat the manager, who is simulating a safety. After he passes the manager, he accelerates up the field for another 7 to 8 yards. We are working on ball technique and high knees, and we are working on our vision. We work on a cut, and finally we are working on acceleration. I have seen drills where the players would get over that last dummy, turn, and jog back to the end of the line. We do not want that. The difference in your backs going for a long run may be a result of acceleration, so we work hard on this at the end of the bags. As soon as the back makes his cut, he accelerates as hard as he can. As soon as he has the man beat at the narrowest margin, he is straight up the field. He does not want to continue at an angle toward the sideline, where he gets pinned out of bounds on the 3- or 4-yard line. We want to try to beat the pursuit angles immediately after we beat the defender upfield with hard acceleration.

In the next drill, we turn sideways and go over the bags so that both feet hit between the bags. As we come off the last bag, I move the manager up about 4 yards from the last bag. I have to give him a head fake and a shoulder fake in one direction to get him leaning one way, and then I have to beat him. He is too close to beat him with a spin move.

On the third drill, we face the opposite direction stepping over the bags. I have the manager almost on top of the back as he comes off the last bag. The manager pops him with a push-back dummy. As the manager pops the back, he gets in a really tight spin move. We spin so that we gain ground on the spin move. We want to spin the ball away from the defender. We want to spin, gain ground, and get up the field. The reason we work on the spin move is this. There are times in a ball game when you have a breakdown up front. You get the ball, and the defense is right in your face. You do not have a chance to do anything else but spin and turn to try to get upfield.

The next day, we do three bag drills. This time we are going to do the stutter drill. This time we go over the bags and stutter our feet in between the bags as we cross the bags.

This drill teaches body control. When they first start this drill, they have problems. As they stutter the feet, the rest of their body is moving forward. That is the way most backs are. They get the ball and want to score. This helps control their body as they go over the bags.

The next time, we will stay sideways and step over the bag with both feet. On the next bag, we step over with one foot and then twist over the other bags.

The third time, we shuffle over the bags and then accelerate as we come off the bags. We do some bag work every day except the day before the game. These drills take only a couple of minutes.

The next thing we do is to go through what we call our three-step cuts. The reason we do this drill is because I want our backs to be upfield runners. I want them to think about making the quick, hard, sharp cut. I do not want a lot of stutter stepping. I want them to make the quick, hard move up the field. We set cones about four steps apart. We start off running three steps and then plant, three steps and plant, up and down the field. We want hard, quick, slashing moves.

 





Page 209

We do not want our backs getting caught going laterally. We want a slashing-type runner. We want to get upfield. We want a 2nd and 4 call instead of a 2nd and 9 call. We do this every day with our backs. That gets the idea in their mind of the type of runner we want. They go up through the cones and then back through the cones. That does not take but a minute or two.

Next, we go to what we call the balance drill. I think it is a great drill to get the backs used to having their hands on the ground. I want our backs to understand that they are backs who finish off runs. I want them to be able to come off the ground with that hand and to be able to accelerate as they come up, so we put them in that position. You will see this in the film of our drills.

We put them down with one hand on the ground. The arm extends down from the shoulder to the ground. It is not way out in front of them. I want as much pressure on the hand as is on our foot. I want the back leg up above the butt. We want to roll our eyes up high. I put them into this position for at least 15 seconds with a ball in their hand. On the ''hut,'' they hop forward for about a yard. They keep the same hand and same foot down. They go for a series of four or five of those moves, then they come up running out of there. That is what we call the balance drill. They must have the same hand and same foot down, for example, right hand and right foot. As they hop, they switch hands and feet. When they have the same foot and same hand down, it becomes much more difficult.

We tie that in with a gauntlet drill. We have a line of players form the gauntlet. The back starts out 5 or 6 yards in front of the gauntlet, does four or five balance moves, then accelerates into the gauntlet. The players try to knock the ball out of his hand. He must put the ball in front of his breast plate, high and tight. We never go through the gauntlet with two hands on the ball. As the back comes out of the gauntlet, I will be at the end of the line. He must make a move on me and then accelerate up the field again. We do this drill every Wednesday.

We also have the wheel drill. We have four dummies in a circle. The backs step over the dummy with a ball in their hands. The back will have one hand down on the ground. As he crosses the bag, he goes all the way around the bag and then goes to the next one. As he gets to the last bag, he comes out and accelerates for 8 to 10 yards.

We use the wheel drill to change things up with the balance drill. We do the balance drill most of the time, and we do the wheel drill occasionally, but we do not miss those three drills. We do the bags, three-step cuts, and the balance drill every day. We get through them in a short period of time.

Another thing that the balance drill does is give your backs the stretch in the shoulder and hip areas to get them ready for practice. I think it is a good way to start

 





Page 210

practice. We try to simulate game situations with what we are doing in these drills. The first 10 minutes of practice is just that; it is warm-up. When they come to me for drill work, they have to be ready to go. Some backs are notorious for wanting to stretch through half of practice. Some of them want to go through group work at half speed. Then when it comes time for team work, all of a sudden they are ready for practice. Our backs know when we go to drills, we are thinking of playing football. We are not thinking of it as continuing to warm up for team work. That may be an attitude problem that you may want to work on with your running backs.

Next we run a drill that we call react and cut. We get the same bags and stand them up. We have a manager holding those bags. We have a line of players behind the dummies with a ball. I will put a cone at the side of the bag and one down the field about 10 yards. We have the players come smoothly to the bag. They press that point of attack. Then the manager leans one bag one way or the other. The player shuffles away from the bag and accelerates through the hole. We do not want him to shuffle too wide.

This drill is working a little on our inside zone running play. On that play, we tell the back this: Smooth to the hole, press the point of attack. If he has an onside crease that he knows he can get to and make a big play, then he is to accelerate through the onside crease. If there is no onside crease, then he must think about taking the ball to the back side. It is imperative on the inside zone play that the back comes to the hole smoothly. They cannot be coming so fast that they cannot cut the play back to the back side. They must operate in a smooth fashion coming to the hole. What we are doing in the drill is forcing the back to find the backside crease. He has to find the hole, and then he has to accelerate through the hole. This drill ties in very well with our inside running game. We do not want them to come to the line of scrimmage and stutter-step. He finds the hole and works on acceleration.

We have one other drill that we do. We do not do this drill every day, but we make sure that we work on it a couple of times a week. We line up four cones in a straight line less than a yard apart. The back takes the ball in his right hand and starts toward the dummy. He shuffles through the first three cones. Then he sprints to the next cone and spins around the next cone. He puts the ball in the other hand. Then he accelerates to the next cone. We have a manager there with a hand dummy. He slams the back with the hand dummy. What we are doing is trying to make sure that we get every inch we can along that sideline.

Nothing bothers me more than to see a running back drift out of bounds when contact is made. We want to make sure that we get every inch we can on each play. We are working on the shuffle step, we are working on putting the hand down, we are working on switching the ball and accelerating, and we are working on getting every inch we can on the sideline. If you will notice, we are trying to combine two or more techniques into the drill.

 





Page 211

Another drill we call the jump drill. Most great backs have quick feet. They are not plodders. You do not hear them coming. They put the foot down, and they are gone. We put four bags down. We lay the bags in a Z-like design. The runner faces the first bag. He jumps over the first bag with both feet together. He keeps his shoulders parallel to the line of scrimmage. He jumps over the next bag sideways. We want him to go over the bags with light feet if possible. Then he jumps the next bag, again keeping the shoulders square. He jumps over the last bag and then accelerates through the cones.

At the end of the drill, we have two players with pushback dummies at the cones. The back comes off the last dummy, accelerates, and tries to split the two players with the dummies. They jam the runner to give him some resistance. He will lower his shoulder, split those two dummies, and then accelerate. We always finish the drill off with some kind of acceleration.

I want to show you the drills on tape. [Video]

In the off-season, we do a lot of jumping rope. We do a lot of rope skipping where we are moving. We do not do a lot of static rope jumping. We are working on getting our feet up and down as quickly as possible. We do not want the feet coming up high. We want really quick feet. We jump with two feet and then jump back across the line with one foot. We work on quick feet movement. Then we jump or skip sideways. First, we do one foot, then we do two feet sideways. Then we do both feet backwards.

Next I want to get to what we are doing in terms of contact drills and blocking drills. Our philosophy is no different from most others. If our back can make the defense miss him and he can run for a touchdown each time, that is great. But you and I know that is not the way football is. If you can make them miss and you can put it in the end zone, then do it. If you get pinned in with one man, we want to use the lift drill. If we are pinned on the sideline and we do not have the opportunity to cut back, we know that we are going to make contact with the defender, and we are going to look him up.

When we see that contact is obvious, we are going to look him up. We are going to turn back into the man. We are going to go look him up. We drop our arm and our fist as if we were going to plant it into the ground. We want to get our shoulder pad under the defensive man's shoulder pads. As we come into contact, we want to turn our hips in to the man. As contact is made, we want to come up with our elbow in tight and a really hard punching action with our upper body. We try to lift through the man and try to get yards after contact.

We keep a chart called "after-contact yards." We score them with a plus or a double plus. If our back makes contact with the defender and he gets 4 1/2 yards, we give him a plus YAC. The YAC is yards after contact. If he gets 7 or more yards, we give him a double-plus YAC. If he only gets 1 or 2 YAC, that is only average. We expect more. If he gets no yardage, he gets a minus. Our backs set a goal going into each game of how many YACs and how many double YACs they want to get in a game. They are thinking about breaking tackles. They are thinking about yards after contact.

To simulate the drill, we will put another running back down on all fours. The back with the ball will be 3 to 4 yards from him. On the sound of "hut," the defender comes up to simulate a tackler. The back turns and gets into the tackler. He makes slight contact and brings the fist up into punching action. He wants to work through the lift. I do not want to get underneath the man and punch up, I want to punch through. Punching through and at the right angle is where you are going to get the YAC. In the spring we do this drill every day. In the season we do it through Wednesday, making sure that they get at least one lift with each arm. The key is to get into the middle of the defender

 





Page 212

and not out on the shoulder pad. You have to turn back in to the man.

If you have more than one man to deal with, we just cover up with both hands on the football, get our pads lower than their pads, try to split the area, and try to get YAC. In our backs' minds, this is what they are thinking, and we get enough reps on it. If they can beat a defender with a one-on-one move, they do it. If they are dealing with only one man, they use the lift. If they are against more than one man, they do the blast. To teach the blast drill, sometimes we use the blaster. We will put two men with hand dummies in front of the blaster. If he can split the two dummies, then he will come on through the blaster. If he can't split the first two men with the dummies, he does a spin and heads back up the field. It is a great drill for backs to get their pads down and to develop good running angles. After we teach the drill, we run it at a high tempo.

We teach four blocks in our system. We have what we call an attack block, an attack-and-adjust, a pass pro block, and a cut block. It does not matter what they are doing on the field, but they should be using one of those four blocks when they are called on to block. This is true even when they are blocking out of the punting game. We are still an old-fashioned punting team. We still have two tight ends, two up backs, a fullback, and a punter. Our up backs set in the hole between the center and guards. If anyone comes in that gap, he attack-blocks him before he goes down to cover.

If you are on the kickoff return team and you are the fullback, you come up and block using what we call an attack-and-adjust block. If you are on a special team, one of those four blocks will come into play.

An attack block is when the ball carrier is directly behind us and the back is going to break off our block. They are used on power and iso plays. We want to execute the block by running in a natural motion. We do not want the arms swinging hard. We do not want the feet to be in a wide base. We want the feet up underneath us. Again, we want to make sure that our pad level is under the defender's pad level as we do the striking. We do not snap the hips up on the striking. All that does is to raise you up and bring your pad level up. We never snap the hips forward on the contact.

It is one thing to block a defender who is standing still and another thing to block a linebacker who is moving. We start out working on our pass pro block. We have each man take three blocks, and then on the fourth block I will critique each individual. It is a quick drill. We go to the attack block after that. Each player gets four blocks each.

I talked to you about the attack block. The attack-and-adjust works this way. As the blocker approaches the defender, the defender shuffles a couple of quick steps. Now the blocker must adjust his body by shuffling. He get his hips squared up with the defender and then attack-blocks him. The key is to get the feet underneath them and get back in front of the defender. After he adjusts his path, it becomes an attack block.

I will take you through the different running and blocking drills on the tape. [Video]

On the blocking phase of the film, there was some good blocking. You are not going to knock people down all of the time, and you are not going to win all of the battles. They have to understand that they do not win every battle on the football field. If they are trained right in terms of your drills and techniques, you have a chance to win most of your games. The key is to have your backs go into the game with a tremendous amount of confidence. If you are a running back in our system, you are really involved in play after play. I want them confident about their technique and confident about their ability in terms of going into the contact phase of the game.

I want to thank the high school coaches because you do a great job. We have to depend on your films a lot. We have 38 states that we cover, and we do not see everyone. But where there is a player, we try to see him. We appreciate the high school coaches for their cooperation. If there is anything we can do for you, let us hear from you. You are welcome to come to visit us. Thank you very much. I appreciate being here.

University of Hawaii

There is one thing Blaine Gaison failed to mention in the introduction. If we do not get our ass moving in the right direction, we will be looking for a new job soon. I appreciate your supporting the Nike Clinic. It always amazes me that football coaches would be here this late to hear a lecture. It is after 9 P.M., and we still have a good crowd remaining in place to listen to a 210 coach. The coach is up here because he is trying to pay a debt back to Nike for shoes for the team. It amazes me that you would sit in here this late. We have locked the doors, so you can't leave if you wanted to anyway.

Frank Solich of Nebraska just spoke. I listened to his lecture. I have been on the other end of five Cornhuskers games, and I can assure you that they knock your ass down. Frank said they don't run over people, but they do.

One thing that amazes me is that you guys will pay your money to come to a clinic, come from a neighbor island, or drive across the state to come to listen to someone lecture on football just to improve your vocation. That is unique to this business. It makes you unique. You are listening to a 2-10 coach speak at this time of night. I appreciate the opportunity to swap ideas about football with you. I appreciate your participating in this clinic and in a game that is very special to all of us. It is a time in our society where we represent the last bastion of discipline in that society in many respects. If we do not kick them in the rear and straighten them out and give them some direction, I do not know who in the schools are going to in this day and age. Looming litigation keeps the school administrators from doing it, and classroom teachers will not do it, so coaches are the last hope. If you are not setting the example in private and public schools, I do not know who is going to. Young people need more guidance and direction today than they ever needed. The challenges in coaching are greater than they have ever been before. That is because young people today are being reared differently. There are a lot of temptations out there today. There are things other than football for them to do.

Football is a difficult sport to play in that it is not a natural thing. Practicing football is not always pleasant. There is a lot of tedium and monotony in it. It challenges us to stay on top of the game and to give them plenty of guidance and direction.

I am going to talk about the role of concentration and finish. We have to get it right because my contract is running out soon.

This husband and wife went out on the golf course to play a round of golf. He had to hit from the back tee each time, and she would tee off from the ladies tee that was closer. On the fourth hole, he teed his Titlist ball up, and-bang!-he hits his wife right in the head. Mrs. Liebusch goes down, and she does not get up. He calls the EMS, and a doctor came and pronounced her dead right there. He felt horrible about what had happened. They decided that they would have to do an autopsy. They did the autopsy and called Mr. Liebusch up to discuss the autopsy. This is what the doctors said: "Mr. Liebusch, we found out that when the Titlist golf ball struck your wife in the head, she sustained a skull fracture. As a result of it, she died. However, the puzzling part of this whole thing is that we found a Dunlop golf ball in her anus." Mr. Liebusch said, "That is not very puzzling to me. That was my Mulligan."

I want to talk to you about our approach to our philosophy, administration, and organization. Before we can get anything done in football, we feel we must be able to capture our players' concentration and give them a concept of finish. So much of what we do requires that we have total concentration by our players. How do you do that? How do you build a concept of finish? Everyone knows that you have to

 





Page 214

start things, but frequently you do not know how to finish them. One of the things that helped us when I was with the 49ers when we were successful was this. Our players knew how to play to a standard of play, they knew how to concentrate through out, and they knew how to finish.

There are three musts for our program to be successful. First, we must be able to teach and maximize concentration for our athletes. Second, they must know how to practice with intensity. Practice basically is a dress rehearsal for the game. Practicing is critically important. In our sport, in this day and age, we only have 20 hours to prepare our athletes. Three of those hours are devoted to the game, so we have only 17 hours to practice. If we do not maximize their concentration, get them to practice with intensity, and build some concept of finish, then we are in trouble.

One of the places we start is in our team meetings. Let me stress the importance that we put on the reaction to the meeting setting. We tell our players that if we have a meeting, there is a reason for it. If we step before you, we have something of importance that is germane to the sport that we need to get across to you. It is imperative that we get your attention. I have neatness as the number one thing. We are talking about conduct and decorum in the meeting setting. If you do not get what you ask for in that setting, you are not going to get it on the practice field.

It all starts with meeting and how you practice. That will determine how you are going to play in the game. When you come into a meeting, the room is going to look a certain way. When you leave, it should look the same way. We do not want a lot of spit cups, apple cores, or other garbage left behind. If we had the room set up a certain way, we want you to leave it that way. It is the same in the dressing room. We cannot have jocks, shoes, helmets, cups, and other things left all over the locker room. We are going to police the area. Basically, it is a reflection of the players' attitude. If we do not police it properly and pay attention to it, then we probably are not getting the results in other areas as well. Football transcends the field. It goes into the locker room, the training room, the weight room, and the meeting room that we use.

When we go into a meeting room, we expect the players to come in and seat themselves, put their feet on the floor, sit up straight, rivet their eyes on the speaker, and listen and hear. There is a difference. Those of you who are married know that your wives insist that you do not know the difference in listening and hearing. "You hear, but you do not listen!" Kids are great at this. They must give up their eyes. Posture tells us something about their learning attitude. It should be no different from the classroom sitting. We expect our players to sit up. We do not want them to put their feet up on the chair in front of them. We do not expect them to drape their feet over the shoulders of the man in front of them. We do not want them in a posture that is not receptive to learning, so, "Park your rear end in the chair, sit up straight in the saddle, rivet your eyes on the speaker, listen and hear, look and see." You are not guaranteed that you are getting the player's attention all of the time just because he is looking at you or just because he appears to be hearing you. He may be daydreaming about another coed somewhere on campus, but you will not know. But you have a chance, and it is important that you police that chance. That is part of our responsibility. If I have a player whose eyes are wandering around the room, he may be looking at something else, and he may be asleep.

Neatness is another thing that is important. It should not look as if the volunteer fire department just responded to a call after the meeting is over. We reset the chairs, pick up the garbage, and put the room back as it was. Then they can get their happy butts out to practice. During that setting, they should have given us their eyes and ears. It is important that we police that and get it. You get what you ask for. Anytime you are in a meeting setting and you are not comfortable with that setting, you are the one at fault, not the players. If the players' eyes are not on you, get their damn eyes on you. If you do not think a player is listening, get his attention. Turn the volume up, and get his attention. It is important not to lose any one of those swinging Richards in that room during that meeting. What you are imparting in that meeting they are going to put into practical application on the field a little later. It is important that you get what you want in that meeting. It is the same way on the field. Make

 





Page 215

certain that what you are asking for you are getting. That is your responsibility to your program, school, and the players. You are dealing with a collective group, but you are dealing with them one at a time.

Locker room, training rooms, and offices are areas where there should be a certain decorum. There is a certain demeanor that the players should assume. We do not want the training room to be a place where players just hang out. Coaches need to pass through the training room to see how things are going. "How is that ingrown hair on your butt doing, Mortimer? Is it getting better? Hey, you can't afford to miss any more practice, pal. You need to get out there and go to work."

When players come to your office, they need to feel that the door is open to them. It needs to be a place that is warm and receptive, but it comes time when you must take care of business. "What can I do for you?" Get the problem out on the table, and then get him out of there. It should not be a place where they lounge around.

Locker room settings can be interesting places. They can become sociological pockets. One thing that we did when I was at San Francisco with Coach Walsh was to go through the locker rooms, both pre- and postpractice, to see how things were going. Every once in a while, you have this little pocket of players that may be planning a coup d'état with your squad. You need to walk right in the middle of that and spoil t. There can't be any sanctuary for the players. They need to know that you are every place. They need to know that you are interested in how they are doing. "Is everything going OK up on campus?" They need to see you as someone other than a policeman of their rights and wrongs on the football field. I think it is important for the coach to pass through the locker room, not only to police the area, but to take a look to see what is going on. Some of you may be surprised at what goes on in some locker rooms. There may be a cure for AIDS in some of these lockers. If you do not get by and take a look at them once in a while, the players will think you do not care and will not make an effort to keep the place neat. Now, do not misunderstand-we do not have standby inspections. But players notice if you come around or if you care how things look. We need to take a look to see how things are going. If you don't, they start to think you do not care. That will start to reflect on the attitude of your team that you do not want to have. How they behave in the training room, how they treat the training-room people and equipment people, how they treat one another, and how they treat the facilities you have are important. Ours need improving, and I am sure most of yours do too. But what you have is what you have. Until it gets improved, it is the best that you have, and their attitude is reflected in how the players take care of it.

It is important for the coach to be present in all areas of the program. They need to understand that there is a modus operandi in the locker room, training room, meeting room, offices, and on the field. This is all part of capturing that concentration. It is all part of building the finish to the football team.

There is always danger in rumors and innuendos. You can defuse a lot of that by being present. You can learn a lot by taking 15 minutes to walk through the locker room after practice. "How did it go today, Mortimer? Are the towels soft enough? How is the soap?" When you get around in the locker room and visit with them, they know you care.

Football is a family affair. A lot of things that go on with a football team are confidential. We have guys, and they have them in pro football, that will call home with a problem. "He called me an SOB in practice." Now, we do not want to do that, and it may happen, but you would like to keep some things as confidential as possible. You do that by talking to them in this manner. "This is a manly sport, and we interchange on a manly level. We want to keep things within the family setting." Meetings are very important, and that is why we have them. We do not want to call meetings just to be meeting. We want to keep them short, concise, and to the point. We do not want to waste their time, and we do not want them to waste our time. If we have a meeting, we have something to tell them. When we are through with the meeting, we want to break. We always want to finish the meeting with a special flare. You may think this is corny; we think it is important.

 





Page 216

We break all meetings just as we break the huddle. When we have finished, we say, "Ready, break." We all break and get out of the room. They should get sucked out of the room just as if there was a vacuum pulling them out of the room. They may visit for a minute, but they should move on to the next venue, which is probably the practice field. The sooner they can get out there, the better off you are. You only have a limited amount of time.

We want to be ahead of time, not on time. What is on time? If time were not important to us, we would not have clocks. We have clocks and calendars. If it is important, they need to be on time and ahead of time.

Next, I want to talk about systems, styles, and standards of play. A premium is placed on explosive movement and finish in football. This is true for offense or defense. It is the same with the kicking game. We need to be explosive, and we need to know how to finish. What is finish? How do you practice finish? You have to build this into your practices. It is as simple as that. People do not naturally finish things. They do not finish things in the classroom or any other venues that we have talked about unless you insist that they finish them.

We play a lot of situational football. So do you. Everyone does in this day and age. That is true for special teams, offense, or defense. In our concept of football, we are going to play a lot of players. Last year we had to. Some of them did not want to stay on the field. "Get your butt back out there! I don't care, we are behind. You stay out there and play." We have a lot of guys to play. We think that is healthy. We think it is healthy for the general mental health of our football team. Situational football gives you an opportunity to use a lot of players. You can build them a role. When you do that, they are less inclined to detach from your program or feel as if they are not making a viable contribution. Everyone wants simplicity and flexibility. Those are by-words in football. The good coaches are the ones who can simplify things and take the complexity out of things. They reduce it to the simplest terms and impart it to their players. Timing is of the essence. Time is of the essence in the game, of the essence in preparation.

We do not compromise on work ethics. We stress intensity and finish. We do not compromise work ethic at all. We can't afford to, even if we were a great team-and we all know that we were not-but if we were a great team, and I have been around some great teams. The difference in two teams' playing is that the great team knows how to maintain concentration throughout and finish what they start. They have to practice those things. They have to understand the importance of those things. These points do not come naturally. It isn't natural to finish. It isn't natural to practice hard and to work hard in the practice setting. That is a dress rehearsal. Practice should be harder than the game. We want machinelike proficiency. We must be concise. Unit play is critically important. The team comes first. There is strength in numbers. The team will always come first. Any player who insists on a guaranteed start is taking the first step in getting put out of our program. There are no start guarantees in our business. You are a better team when you have competition between positional candidates. If someone wants a start guarantee, that is not the spirit of the business.

The team always comes first. It always has and always will. That is the thing that is unique about the game of football. We are the only sport that plays with that many people. You may have between 75 and 110 players on your squad. We have between 105 and 108, counting the walk-ons. We have 85 on scholarship. It is a unique game. That is a lot of people to manage and to get to concentrate and finish collectively. It is a lot of players to get to play together as a team. They must put the team as the number one priority and not themselves. It is important for you to home in on that and for your players to understand that.

When you have a meeting and you feel uncomfortable with one of the players, get that crap straight right away. "What is the problem, Mortimer? You have a funny look on your face. You look like you just had a crap sandwich and did not like the taste. We can't have that. I can't talk to you about line stunts with that look on your face. So, what the hell is the matter?" We will sit down and talk about it. I have to find out what the problem is.

 





Page 217

Our edge should be in tactics, in our belief, in our intensity, and in our mental acuity. It all has to be built in, once again in meetings and practice. You have to draw their attention. They must be able to maintain concentration and finish.

We believe in a starting rotation concept in our program. If you come out and practice hard and practice to the extent we expect of you, you should have a right to feel that you are going to be able to function in some capacity on our football team. You are going to be in the starting rotation. Now, we know the program indicates that 11 players will start. That is fine. But that is not the way it shakes out for us. We are a better football team if we play with 15 or 18, but not at the same time. The more people we can play on one side of the ball, the better we feel we can be. The more players you play, the more it will affect the stamina and the tempo of your team. It is also going to affect the mental health of your team. You may say that Mort can only go to his left. Well, put him in the game and let him go left, and then take him out. Put a guy that can go over, right, and left. Then put Mort back in at another time. Mort will feel good about himself, you will feel good about playing Mort, his folks will be happy, and all of his relatives will buy tickets. Now Mort will not go over and park his butt on the bench and detach from the game. He will not be able to afford to, because the next time it is 3rd and 1, his happy butt may be back out there going to the left again. It is important for the starting rotation concept to kick in for us.

If you invest, you play. That does not mean that you play all of the time. I did not say that. If you invest, you play. How much you play may be related to how outflanked you are. If you invest, you play, and we have a deal. There is nothing worse than the player who goes over on the sideline and tells others that he is not going to play. What does he do? They are looking up in the stands and waving at people. They are listening to the band and checking the hindquarters of the rally squad. They are not involved in the game at all. You tell them to get into the game, and they want to know where to line up. They are not ready to play. They are the first players to bitch about not playing after the game. Don't let them detach. I would rather have a lesser athlete in the game who is fresh than a premium athlete who is exhausted. We would rather play with 14 to 15 men.

If you play, you have accountability. We had a tough year last year. We were not a very good team. We had some great kids, and they played hard and worked hard. If they invested in practice, they got to play. They were always accountable. They did not complain about a lot of things. They knew that if we came up short in a game, the coaches were accountable, and so were they. It was an agonizing year. We were able to get through the year because they believed that they would get an opportunity to play and contribute. They knew by their involvement that they were going to be held accountable.

In talking about finish, think about this. No matter what you are doing in a practice session, you need to develop a finish. I learned this a long time ago, when I was at Virginia Tech. I was coaching the offensive line. We brought in a coach by the name of Phil Cutchins, who was the head coach at Oklahoma State, who got fired. It happens to us all sooner or later. Phil went into the banking business and was happy as hell. But our head coach brought Phil in to observe our practices because he knew football. He watched us practice as individuals and looked at our blocking schemes. The thing I got from one of those sessions with Phil was this: "Be careful what you say to your players." He said to talk to them about bouncing off the ground, not getting off the ground. Talk to players about exploding their eyes and hands. That has a more visual concept to it than just "Put your hands here." Get off the ground! Hurry up! Be quick, but don't hurry! There are a lot of word pictures that you can paint for your players that are important.

We apply this to the concept of finish. We try to finish every drill. We want them to get the idea that they do not gradually stop, they do not walk. The reason we came to this concept was this. If you go out and watch other teams practice, you will see a lot of players standing around doing nothing. Only a few players are being coached. The important thing about the time constraints is that we cannot afford to have anyone not being coached. If we have eight men in a line and

 





Page 218

one man on a sled, then that man is getting the hell coached out of him. We have eight men in a line and one working. Are the men standing in line in a manner that denotes that they are maintaining concentration? Are they allowing themselves to be coached even though they are not physically taking a turn? There needs to be some methodology for how they stand in line. Do you want them in line as the military does? Do you just want to make certain that they are watching the man taking the turn? When he is being coached, they are in turn being coached. The others should learn from any mistake he makes. They should learn from anything positive he does. If you do not pay attention to their concentration and finish and its relationship to the drills, you will have eight players do different things. It is our job to home in on concentration and finish.

As soon as the player concludes with the sled, he does something to finish the drill. He doesn't just slam the sled and work his feet, you blow the whistle and tell him to stop working his feet, then he walks his happy butt back to the end of the line. The others in line are watching that event. He is not getting any finish out of that. If that happens, you have really lost the essence of what you are trying to get accomplished in the drill. In everything they do, we make a big deal that there must be a finish to it. We do not want to glide or walk away from a drill setting. What is a drill? It is a microcosm of the game. You are taking some segment of the game out, and you are working on it. I want to be certain that if I am coaching Mort on the sled, the other guys in line are paying attention to what I said. As I work Mort, I want to look at them to see whether they got the right idea. I do not want to repeat everything I said to Mort to each player.

The same thing happens in a meeting. You need to make certain that you are finishing the meeting the way you want to. Did I capture their concentration? I don't know, because I can't look inside of their heads. But if they are looking at me and it appears that they are listening, then we have a chance. That is all we ever want in this sport anyway. I have a chance to hold that man. Now, when he goes out on the field and puts that into practical application, I will see whether he learned it or not. I want to make certain that if I can only coach one or two at a time, the other guys are homed in on what we are doing. You get the point.

These are points that we can expect from one another. It needs to be clear-cut to the players what they can expect from the coaches and what we expect of them. Put it down. It can be a list of 10 things or 20 things, whatever. We reduce our list to as few as we can and then tell them that this is what we expect of them. "This is what you can expect of us."

What can the players expect from the coaches? We should be consistent. We are going to expect them to meet a certain standard of play, concentrate, and finish strong in everything we are doing. We are not going to relax that standard for a player just because he is a talented player or because we are doing something that may not seem to be important. It is all important, or we would not do it.

They must feel the difference between urgency and whatever you use to caricature your football team. You do not want a player to be a fanatic. That is not a good posture. He needs to be urgent. It means that a thing is sudden, and it is happening right now. "Let's make this thing urgent." It is an urgent proposition. It needs to be done at a certain tempo. We have prescribed the tempo, and it has to go that way. As coaches, we are not paid to be satisfied. If we won a game 75-0, we would still find something to gripe about. We are trying to play to a special standard.

We are going to give them leadership and direction. It is going to be firm, and it is going to be on our terms. It is going to be with the team orientation in mind. We want to create an open dialogue. If you have something stuck in your butt, come in, and let's talk about it. We try to find out what the problem is.

Coaches are accountable. If you pick up the paper, you will find out that we are accountable. They should expect us to have technical command of what we do. We should know what the game is about. We do not have all of the answers, but we do have a lot of them. We have to respect the player for what he is going

 





Page 219

through. It is not going to be an easy street. We respect the fact that they are involved in a demanding sport. We must have a sense of humor. You bet!

What do we expect from players? They must be urgent. They must concentrate. We have to work to get them to concentrate. They have to cooperate in the concentration effort. Some of them may say, ''Why do we need to concentrate?'' Some players have a tough time concentrating. You need a mechanism to help them concentrate. Get those things in a formula, and you may have a chance.

We expect full compliance. "Why did you do it that way? How come you called that play?" "Because." "Get your butt in there and block." They need to have a will to prepare. Everyone wants to play in the games. Are they willing to prepare to play the games? Preparing is a bitch; at least it should be. They should think the game is a lark.

They must be accountable. They need to commit to something. This is tough for the youth of today. They must be willing to play a role. "What is the best role for you on this team? What do you think it is?" No; it isn't that. Here is what we think it is. We try to work with the players, but sometimes they will not be satisfied with what we decide. Coaches coach and players play and that is it, unless you are in the NBA. That is one of the reasons I only coached in the NFL for eight years. I have coached at every level except Pop Warner, and that may still be coming. This doesn't make me an expert on anything. One of the reasons I stepped away from the NFL was this. It was fun, but I did not make as much money as the players. That did not make sense to me. You have players who are making a million dollars, and you are only making 65 thousand or something like that as a coach. You have to understand that you are responsible for directing the traffic, and that is the way it is.

Finish. Put a circle around 
finish. 
This means that our players will do something special when they get to the end of a drill. He may sprint to a cone, do a forward shoulder roll, then get up and run to the end of the line. He is going to do something special to finish that drill. He does not just step over the large bags and walk back to the end of the line. He is going to move. We tell them that we want them to run or stand still-no walking. We can go out on the street to walk. They are young, and so they can run.

 [Editor's note. Coach Von Appen went on to discuss th
e 
role of concentration and finish in relation to the pass rush. However, due to technical difficulties, we were unable to reproduce the last part of the lecture.]

Developing a Philosophy and a System

Clemson University

The first thing I want to talk about is what we have done at Clemson. We have found over the years that, regardless of what you do, you had better have a plan. You had better stick to your plan. We have developed some things at Clemson that we stick to. We have an overall philosophy, we have a football philosophy, and then we have a system. Our philosophies are set in stone. They do not change. We will always keep those philosophies. Our system will change.

When we first started at Clemson, our staff started talking about philosophy. We said that we were going to build upon a philosophy that will win. That is the bottom line: We wanted results. We decided to break down the philosophy into two areas. We have an overall philosophy and a football philosophy. We all know what wins. Generally, about 90 percent of the time, the teams with the best players win. We have an advantage over you in that we can recruit. However, at times, that may not be an advantage. We all know the best players win. What if you do not have the best players? You cannot just throw in the towel and say that you do not have players as good as the opponents. In our overall development, we have developed our philosophy so that talent does not have anything to do with winning.

The second part of our philosophy is that we feel we must sell our program to the players. Our players must believe in the overall and football philosophies. We started from day one three years ago selling our philosophy of how we were going to win games and eventually win our conference.

The third part was to be committed to the philosophy. I feel this point is critical. You and your staff have to be totally committed to the way you are going to win. That may sound good, but we really are committed. It does not matter whether you are the head coach, assistant coach, trainer, or manager, you have to be totally committed and understand what our philosophies are. "This is how we are going to do things, and this is how we are going to win football games." People in our program know our philosophy, are totally committed, and believe that we will win. Our team believes they will win.

In our overall philosophy, we said our first goal is toughness. That is number one in our overall philosophy. I will tell you why it is that way. I truly believe that this game has never changed. The game that we have been a part of all of our lives and the game that we love has never changed. It has never changed. People have changed, players have changed, coaches have changed, but our game has never changed. It is still a game of blocking, tackling, and fundamentals. There is no way around toughness in football. There may be in some other sports. We are in the only sport where contact is not a penalty. In our sport when two players knock the heck out of each other, the fans stand and cheer. In any other sport, it is a foul or penalty. There is no way around toughness in our game. We preach to our team that we are going to outhit our opponents for four quarters. That is a big point for us. This does not guarantee that we are going to win the game. This is only going to guarantee us a chance to win. That is the mental part of the game. We talk about mental toughness and physical toughness. We preach this every day. That is how we are going to win. Toughness is a key part of our game and is what we believe in.

I believe toughness is a part of consistency. If your kids are tough and they believe that they are tough, they will practice that way. I think that breeds consistency. You do not have games where you are up high for one game and down low for the next game. If you are tough and your kids believe it, I think it breeds consistency. Toughness is number one in our program.

The second point in our overall philosophy is conditioning. We are totally committed to conditioning as a staff and as a team. Our team believes in conditioning. They did not believe in it at first, I can

 





Page 221

promise you that. They thought the staff was about half crazy. If I am going to ask you to hit for four quarters, you cannot wear down at the end and be successful. We have to be the best-conditioned team. If we are going to be the most physical team in our conference, then we have to be the best-conditioned team. We continue to tell our players the value of conditioning. We tell them that we will be there in the fourth quarter.

The third phase is the attitude part. We feel that toughness is somewhat of an attitude. Conditioning! You have to have the right attitude for conditioning. We talk a lot about enjoying what we do. I enjoy coaching. That is what I do best, and that is what I enjoy. At our first team meeting, I went in front of the team and asked them what they do best. No one said a word. I asked them again. Again, no one said anything. I said, "If I hit it, raise your hand. Cook? Sew? Rake leaves? Play football?" When I said "play football," some hands went up in the air. I said, "Everyone who thinks playing football is what they do best, raise your hand.'' Everyone in the room raised their hand. I assured them that they were right. "That is what you do best.'' If you cannot enjoy what you do best, then you will be a miserable person. Everyone does something well. Everyone does something better than other things. I sold them on the idea of doing what we do best. We enjoy coaching football and playing football. If you do not enjoy it, you should get out of it. We talked a lot about the attitude of it.

I feel that our overall philosophy will never change. We all know that the team with the best players usually wins. How talented do you have to be to be tough? You do not have to be the most talented to be tough. How talented do you have to be to be the best-conditioned player on the field? It does not take talent to be in shape. You do not have to run a 4.4 to be in shape. You do not have to be able to bench-press 400 pounds to be in condition. How talented do you have to be to have a good attitude? How talented do you have to be to enjoy your work? How talented do you have to be to put in a day's work? That does not have anything to do with talent. You can see why the overall philosophy is set the way it is.

We are not the most talented team in our league. Florida State is the most talented team in our league. How are we going to catch Florida State? Get better players than they get? Well, good luck. They are going to be number one, two, or three in the country every year. Their recruiting class this year was rated number one in the country. What if you can't recruit better players than Florida State? Are you just going to play for second place in the league each year? I do not believe in doing that. We have to find a way to overcome them. We have to be tougher, be in better condition, and have a better attitude than they have. Sooner or later that may give us a chance to beat Florida State. I feel that we have closed the gap some recently. The gap when we got there was a 57-0 defeat the year before. The gap is closing, but we are not there. The overall philosophy is set. Again, those philosophies will not change.

Now we get to our football philosophy. First, we want to run the football. We are totally committed to the run. We totally believe in the run. We have to sell this to our program, to our players, and we have to have them committed to this. We have to be able to run the football. It matches with toughness, conditioning, and attitude. That is what we have to do.

It is tough to stop the run in practice if you do not see it in practice. I have coached in places where we did not run the football. We have to be able to stop the run. Those are two things that we spend a tremendous amount of time with.

The third thing that is a part of our football philosophy is that we must be on the plus side on turnovers. We have broken this down in the three years that we have been at Clemson. We have lost one football game where we won the rushing game and were on the plus side on turnovers. We have lost only one game when we could win the rushing game and the turnover game. That was the game at Duke my first year, when we got a punt blocked for a touchdown that beat us. In our system this works. If we do not win the rushing game or we do not win the turnover game, then we have a hard time winning. That is our football philosophy, and that is it. That does not mean that we

 





Page 222

do not want to throw the football. We start out by building the running game.

Now, we are in a position where hopefully we can move forward. We have stuck with our system the past three years. In our second year there, we were fourth in the country in rushing the football. This year we were about 14th. This year we were between 10th and 15th. The first year at Clemson, we led the nation in turnover ratio. We have been in the top 15 in the nation in that category each year. We spend a lot of time working on holding on to the football on offense and trying to knock it loose when we are on defense.

If you will go back and look at all of the teams through the years that were successful, you will find that they all ran the football. When I was growing up, the winning teams were Michigan, Ohio State, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Alabama. They all ran the football. At that time, a lot of them were wishbone teams. They were all able to run the football. They all played good defense. They were all on the plus side on turnovers. They were consistently good.

Let me give you some great stats from the NFL. They are from 1995. If your quarterback threw for over 300 yards, you would win 47 percent of the time. If he threw for over 400 yards, you would win 52 percent of the time. If you had a 100-yard rusher in the game, you would win 89 percent of the time. If you just ran the ball 40 times, you won 92 percent of the time. Those are impressive stats to me.

In our conference in 1995, it was amazing how close our stats were to the NFL. In our league, if you passed for 200 yards, you won 52 percent of the time. If you passed for 300 yards, you still won only 52 percent of the time. If you rushed the ball for over 200 yards in our league in 1995, you won 94 percent of the time. If you rushed for under 200 yards per game, you only won 26 percent of the time. Again, those are convincing stats.

After we leave our philosophy, we get into what we call our system. This is true for the offense, defense, or kicking game. It must fit our philosophy. We feel the system must be flexible. A lot of things dictate what we do in our system. Some teams have systems, and their personnel must fit their system. We are not really that way. We take our personnel and make it fit within our philosophy. It must fit our team. In our system now, we have more of a power game. That is because of the tailback that we have. He is not a slashing type of runner. We have to take our quarterback and do what is best for him. We try to tailor our system to fit our talent. Again, our system must fit our philosophy. We must be able to run the ball. We must be flexible. We must be willing to change the system at any time during the year to fit our team.

In our offensive system for our running game, the first thing we want is the power game. We want to be able to take the fullback out of the I formation and go straight at the defense. We want to be able to take the tailback out of the I formation and go straight at the defense. This is where we start. We start with just a simple belly play to our fullback and a simple power play to our tailback.

The second part of our running game is that we want to run the option game. We are not an option team, but we will always have an option in our attack. We will always have one option play, regardless of our offense. If a team does not have an option in their system, the defense can do a lot of different things. They can play unsoundly and get by with it. If the option does show up, the defense must be accountable for the dive, the quarterback, and the pitch. It only takes one time for the option to burn a defense. We will always have an option play. We keep it very simple. We do not read the option, but we always have one option. When the defense breaks us down on Sunday, they are going to see an option play.

The third part of our system is that we run the misdirection. That play can be a number of things for us. The reverse may be the misdirection play for us. We use different things for our misdirection in our offensive system. We may use the naked reverse and the bootleg plays as our misdirection.

In our running game, we face the 4-3 defense. We are not a 4-3 team; we are a 3-4 defense. Most people in college football have gone to the 4-3 defensive

 





Page 223

scheme. We see this about every week. We may see some eight-man fronts. Everything in our running game is set against the 4-3 defense. We believe that the teams will take their best players and put them at defensive ends. They place them there where they can get up the field and cause problems for the offense. They match up their most talented player against our least talented player. That would be our offensive tackle. We have tried to come up with a system where we do not have to put our worst player up against their best player.

We are a formation team; we are not a motion team. I will show you what we try to do with our formation. We are basically not a tight-end team unless we are going to come into a power game. We go three wide and four wide to run the ball. We want to spread the defense out. We are three wide or four wide, depending on which linebacker we want to get rid of. We know if we go three wide, we can remove the Sam linebacker and make him play the strong safety. If we go four wide, we can make the Will linebacker play the eight-man front outside. We may want the Will linebacker to stay in against our running game because we think our fullback is better. What we look for is match-ups. If we can't match up with one of the linebackers, we will take a wideout and move him outside. That is the basis of what we do in the running game.

TRIPS

I want to show you what we have done with a couple of plays. We took these two plays and made a series out of them. It is the same old belly play that we have all run for years and years. Against the 4-3 defense, we feel that we have had an effect. What we do differently is this. We block the play the same way most of you do. The thing we do differently is to send our tailback opposite. For years, the belly play was off the sweep with full flow to the play side. We send the tailback opposite for two reasons. We are trying to hang the Will linebacker. We would love for him to be keying the tailback on the play. If we can get him to do that, we have a good play. His alignment will determine the block of our tackle. When teams true-stack against us, our tackle can shift through the 5 technique and get to the Will linebacker. Again, it is not a fullflow play.

32 BELLYREGULAR

We come back and run the option game off the belly play. Our quarterback will turn out and make a quick reverse. We will run the belly until we feel that we can get the tackle on the Will linebacker. We do not have to block the 5 technique on either of these plays. All that our option game is on the back side is a sweep without the fullback. Now, we do not have to reach a 5 technique who is a better athlete than we have to block him. The ball is going to be pitched, so we do not have to block the tackle. We want to get our tailback out in the alley. We will get to the Will or Sam linebacker by formation.

If we can't get to him, we can go to three wide receivers. We can move the tight end outside and get the Sam linebacker to come outside. We can get leverage on Sam to get the ball outside if we want to run the play to the strong side.

If we want to run the play to the weak side but we can't run it weak, we will run it out of four wide. Now we have a wide receiver or our fullback with leverage on the Will linebacker.

We can also run it out of a trips set. That will guarantee that we will get leverage on the linebackers.

We do run the combo with the play. We can call 32 or 19, especially when we are going out of trips when they start kicking the defense over. We may take it out the back side. What we want to be able to do is to get our tackle on the first inside linebacker. If we can't do that, then we have to get into a formation where we can get him. We can use the wideout, we can use our fullback, or we can use the tight end to get to the inside linebacker. It will clear itself up more if I can get this videotape going.

Off this play we had the fullback belly, which was a power play straight at the defense. Then we put the option play in off the belly play. We felt that we could get into formations and have an advantage blocking. We would not have to block the 5 technique. Then we do it one step beyond by adding a reverse play off the option as a misdirection play. It is a simple game that we feel gave us an advantage with leverage blocking.

That is how we attack the defense. We are going to have a power play that comes at you. We are going to have an option play off the power play. Then we have the play-action pass off the option play. It is a very simple scheme. This is especially true for our offensive line, where we want to keep it as simple as we can. We were able to run a power, option, reverse, and play action; get in the shotgun formation; and do the same thing. But the thing our offensive coaches did was to create leverage both inside and outside for our linemen. That is a big advantage, as anyone knows.

I appreciate the opportunity to be here. Come to see us practice. Again, thank you.

The 4-3 Defensive Line Package

Saginaw Valley State University

I appreciate the warm welcome. I appreciate your help. We are trying to get established in Michigan. We feel like our team is an up-and-coming team in our conference. We are trying to get over the top in our conference and at the national level. We had an outstanding year last year but it was also disappointing on some points. A lot of people would be happy with a 7-3 record. But we collapsed in the end a little. The injury bug got us. We feel like we are building an outstanding program. We are still recruiting. If you have a player, let me know. At this level the recruiting never stops.

We went to the 4-3 defense two years ago. We had been playing the 4-4 for a number of years. After the first year we felt we needed to get the run stopped a heck of a lot better than we were doing. The biggest reason we went to the 4-3 was to stop the run. A lot of people will tell you the 4-3 won't stop the run. There are too many cutback lanes in it. We flatten out the run and that is what we wanted.

Today I'm going to talk about our fronts. Our main disguise is what we do up front with our front four people. We want to be as simple as possible. I'll talk about defensive line play. I coach the linebacker now but I am a former defensive line coach. We feel like that is where the success of the defense starts. I'll talk about linebacker play a little and a couple of coverages that put us over the hump. To finish up I'll talk about some things that give us problems. In any defense you have problems in certain areas.

The thing that has made us a good defense is playing an attacking front. I can't describe how much an impact that has made with our defense. It lets our defensive lineman come off the ball and try to make plays. Our best players are our defensive linemen. They get in a three-point stance, with their tails up a bit, and they get their heads in a crack and play. That has been the number one thing to improving our defense. This is our philosophy. Here is our identity. (1) We want to be the most aggressive defense in Division II football. (2) We want to develop our style of play. The biggest thing we want to do is try to get our kids to trust one another. Resiliency is what we call sudden change. That is when things go bad on offense and the defense has to hustle back into the game. A big key to defense is; BENDDON'T BREAK. In the sudden change situations we want to be at our toughest. We have to play with effort, have a good attitude, execute, and know our assignments. (3) We want to be technique oriented. We want to teach and play the best technique we possibly can. We want them to be athletes and play. We don't fill their heads with so much that they can't play for thinking. (4) We want to be great tacklers. We teach tackling every day. (5) We want to force turnovers.

Our defensive goals are posted for everyone to see. We developed these goal back at Pittsburg State when we were one of the top Division II teams in the country, year in and year out. I'll go through them briefly for you. (1) Scoring defense less than 12 points per game. We finished this year at 14 points a game. (2) We want to force 3 turnovers per game. (3) At least 5 TANGOS per game. A TANGO is a 3-and-out series. Those are not all our objective but they are the main ones we stress with our kids.

There are a lot of 4-3 teams out there. We have gotten help from the University of Miami. They were really helpful. Everybody's stuff is copied and that is where we get ours.

As far as tackling, the only thing I'm going to talk about is our little creed. Our kids memorize this. It is a saying. Here is what we want to do when we tackle people. These are fundamentals of good tackling. The first thing is to SEE WHAT YOU HIT. The next thing is KISS THE FOOTBALL. That leads up to cross-the-bow tackling. The third thing is TO CLUB UP AND GRAB. The

 





Page 227

last thing is RUN THROUGH THE MAN. The biggest problem in tackling is dead feet on contact. If you can run your feet through the contact, you have a chance to win the battle.

When we talk techniques up front. The zero technique is head-up the center. The shade is on the center. The 's, 2's, and 3's are on the guard. The 4-eye, 4, and 5 are on the tackle. The 6, 7, and 9 techniques are on the tight end. When we talk gaps with our line, it is A, B, C, and D. With linebackers we number the gaps.

In the defensive line we want to screw with the heads of the offensive linemen. Our disguise in our defense is the front four people. We line up in different places. We line up in 8 to 9 different fronts with the front four people. Because of that we are starting to get splits n the offensive line about 6 inches wide. We feel like that is a positive for us. Eventually it generates more tackles for other people.

Our first front we call "BASE." We have our tackle in a 3 technique to the tight end. The nose tackle is in a backside shade on the center. Our weakside defensive end is called "Animal," and aligns in a 5 technique. Our strongside end is in a 9 technique on the tight end. Our Mike linebacker has his heels at 5 yards and is shaded strong on the center. Our Sam linebacker lines up in the C gap with his inside foot aligned on the crotch of the offensive tackle. The Will linebacker is a floater. We )lay him in a lot of places. That is our base front and what we are going to play about 50 percent of the time.

We play this defense all spring long. We won't play anything else. We learn how to play BASE first and play it well. Then we move on to something else. We show a two shell in the secondary. BASE is a good front or us. The problems come from the trap inside and the block-down kick-out on the end. We play him wide because he makes plays, but the tight end gets on our Sam linebacker pretty good sometimes.

The next front is called "G" front. The only difference in alignment is our nose player moves to the 1 technique on the inside shoulder of the weakside guard. We can call "G" with almost any of our other fronts. It is an adjustment. If we get two tight ends we go to automatic ''G." If we are getting wider splits between the guard and center it is automatic "G." We leave a lot of the adjustment up to the nose tackle. If there is a strong guard, we'll move over and make him block the nose tackle all the time. We want to take advantage of the weaker players. At this point and time in our conference, center play is a little down. We are finding smaller kids at center. Therefore we are playing quite a bit of BASE. Playing "G'' is obviously best for the weakside running game. When you play a 4-3 defense, offenses are going to attack your Will linebacker

At Saginaw we run the option and our defense is getting pretty good at stopping it. Our 5 technique is always on the dive. Our 9 technique is always on the quarterback. We plug the Sam linebacker on any flow at him. The Sam linebacker is playing at 5 yards and is plugging the C gap on any flow at him. That means Sam s the dive player on the option his way. The end has the quarterback and the pitch is covered from the secondary depending on coverage. If we are going to win the Division II National Championship, we have to stop the option. Most of those teams are option teams.

The defensive end always goes to the strength of the set and the Animal to the weak side. Since they have moved the hash mark in, there are really no boundary and field positions any more. We always call the strength to the tight end. The reason we do it is personnel. The nose tackle always goes with the Animal and the tackle is always to the end's side. Strength call is important to us and we have to see it early. The first thing the Sam linebacker does at the beginning of the weak is to know who the tight end is.

 





Page 228

That can be a problem with quick or no-huddle teams. We run BASE and "G" 60 percent of the time. The other 40 percent we run different alignments with our tackles. We run something that will create some confusion.

The first one we go to is called "22 KNIFE." Knife is our slant technique.

It is something where we want to get the inside people moving. The 22 means that the nose and tackle are aligned in 2 techniques. Everyone knows when we go to head-up alignments, we are going to slant. But they don't know which way we are going. That is the confusion we want to create. The nose tackle and tackle are slanting back to the BASE defense. The tackle has the B gap strong, and the noseguard has the A gap weak.

In our knife technique we step laterally and fight to get their head in the crack of the gap. We call it "Hat in the Crack." That generates penetration off the slant. It can be good for you if your tackles have a good quick first step. They fight the inside arm, rip up trying to go low to high, and getting in the crack.

We can run the same stunt to the weak side. We call it "22 KNIFE WEAK." It is the reverse stunt from the strongside stunt. The difference is when the end hears a weak call he slants into the C gap. This is a good change-up for us. We create doubt in the offensive linemen's heads when we get in the head-up position. When the splits start to get tight, we know we are causing problems. We knife the short motion at times. The Mike linebacker calls the stunt on the field and we knife the motion. This is a great defense for teams with big splits in the offensive line.

I get excited talking about this next front because it has been real good for us. We call it "11." It is a wing-T stopper. It is an anti-trap front. The inside tackles have one thing in mind. We want them to get two yards of depth into the backfield. We are not seeing a lot of A gap football plays these days. What A gap plays there are is the quarterback sneak and trap. When we get in this defense they have to trap the 5 technique. The wing-T kicked our tails for two years. This defense stopped it.

The tackle and nose line up on the inside shoulders of the guard. When our linemen are playing inside techniques, they are ripping hard with their outside arm right through the ear hole of the guard. They are thinking penetration. The strong end plays a 7 technique. The Animal is in a 5 technique. The guy who loves this alignment the most is the Mike linebacker. The Sam linebacker is covered by the end so he has a chance to run a bit.

Here's how we played against the wing-T. The Mike linebacker takes care of the fullback. He is the midline player. The Mike linebacker spends the whole day tackling the fullback whether he has the ball or not. The Sam and Will linebackers key across unless they have a halfback in front of them. In this case the Will

 





Page 229

has a halfback offset in front of him and that is the man he keys. The Sam linebacker has no back in front of him, so he keys the offset back also.

If the set was a double wing the Sam and Will linebackers keyed the motion man. Anytime there was motion both of them keyed it. We only gave them two places to go. They got flow toward, and flow away from them. On flow toward, they scraped into their gap responsibility. If they got flow away, they got in their stack position inside behind the tackle or nose tackle, and waited for the counter coming back or the fullback on the midline trap.

This defense is our version of a stem front. We don't want to stem too much. We don't want to give them that kind of freedom. They seem to get tired quicker if they are moving all over the place and they are going to forget. When the ball is set we line up in "22," with 3 linebackers in the box. When we go from 3 linebacker to 2 in the box that is good for us. The Mike linebacker calls, "Move." When he does that we stem to what we call ''JOKER.'' We coach the Mike linebacker when to make his call. We do it from the cadence of the offense. The strong safety rolls up to the tight end side. We play cover 3 behind it. The Will linebacker walks to the outside and becomes a true outside linebacker. We don't want to play this defense all the time. It is there to confuse the offense and get stem movement in our defense. The tackle and nose move one technique toward the tight end. They are in a "31" defense to the tight end. We like the personnel we have playing this defense, particularly our strong safety. He is a good off-the-edge player. He is good on the blitz and just a real physical player.

When we go to "JOKER," the blitz package and calls are the same. We couldn't do this unless we tied it all together and used the same words. All we are doing is lining up in different places on the field. The key to doing this are the Sam and Mike linebackers. They have to understand gap changes. When we play three linebackers we play them vertical. There is not a lot of shuffling. The two linebackers look inside; they have to shuffle a little bit.

We have five different fronts. We script those fronts for games. We put all the different looks in the first 15 calls. We feel like the offense has to go in at halftime and go over every look they have seen. They may have seen them the week before, but they don't know the one we are going to run the most.

A huge advantage for us was playing our defensive end in a 7 technique. We kept it simple and brought the 9 technique down into the 7 and it really helped us. He is stepping in and ripping through with the outside arm. If he does the job the ball will bounce to the outside. Our outside linebacker and strong safety love that, because they make tackles.

If we put the defensive end in the 9 technique and slant him to the C gap it is called "CRASH." If the tackle comes out to B gap it is called "SMASH." If we do the same thing to the weak side we call it "GAP" and "SNAP." This is option slip stuff.

We feel like our fronts give the offense a lot of different looks. It is very simple. It gives us something to line up in.

 





Page 230

I'm coaching linebackers now but my heart is with the defensive line. That is where you win games. We are winning football games with our defensive front-four people. The key to us is the attack front. You need the right people to do it. You can't play with a 290-pound slug in there. We have tried to recruit quicker players.

Stance is key and alignment is crucial. We don't vary from a different stance or alignment. You start where you are aligned. Never get beat by bad alignment. We never have our defensive linemen with their helmet within the framework of the offensive lineman. If the offensive line splits start to get tight, it looks like we are sitting in the gap. It doesn't look like we are shaded on anything or anybody. But that is the way we coach it. We are still lined up on the man we are shaded on.

In our stance we get down in a heel-to-toe relationship. If we want to slant, we base up a little and bring our feet closer together. The inside hand goes on the ground. That is the hand closest to the ball. We put the hand down in front of our nose and even with the back foot. We want our punch hand and first step going in the same line. We don't talk about weight distribution but we want the weight on the hand with their butt a little higher than their shoulders. When kids can't get off the ball, it is generally because they get too flat in their back. That comes from being tired also. Don't get so high that you can't see the man you are shaded on. We want our inside foot on the outside foot of the offense.

Our first step is going to be right where our hand used to be. The step ended up being about a 2-foot step. We punch through the hip of the offensive lineman. We take a thumbs-up half-closed fist and punch out nice and firm. We step down and replace our hand. This is if we are in outside techniques. We do this for pad level. High pads lose battles. If we are going to win we have to keep the pads down. When we punch the hip we literally want that offensive lineman to go home with a bruise on his hip. We use this as a feeler to get the shoulder turned to the play.

If we are playing an inside technique like the 1 and 7 technique, we crowd the ball as tight as possible. Place your outside foot on the inside foot of the lineman you are aligned on. He gets his rip arm ready. As the ball is snapped, all the linemen are thinking about is ripping his outside arm. He is not going to punch down to the tackle. That would be a 5 technique. All he is going to concentrate on is stepping and getting his outside arm through. That keeps us from getting in a "Wash. " This has been huge for us. That is the same for a 1 technique.

If we line up in an "11" defense, our tackles have their inside hand down. On their first and second step they are thinking outside arm and ripping it as hard as they can. They rip right through the ear hole of the offensive lineman. He is coming on all fours. He wants to get to the second key as quick as possible. All we have to teach is outside and inside technique with all four of them.

We only talk about six blocking schemes with these guys. The first one is the base block. He punches the hip and works upfield to get his hat in the crack. Do not get stretched, and they find the second key. It is hard to tell a base block and a zone block. In the zone look, the offensive lineman stretches for an instant.

The next one is a reach block or zone block. We step upfield with the first step and punch the hip. Make a quick second step away from the offensive lineman and explode back upfield. We want to end up 1 yard outside and 1 yard upfield. Next, we want to find the second key.

The next thing is the veer block with a cutoff. We step straight upfield and punch the hip. On the second step, we step down with the down block and rip the backside arm through the cutoff block. Look for any trapper. If we see the trapper, we wrong-arm him or

 





Page 231

what we call "Run the Hoop." That is the hoop circle we use in practice. We feel it takes a tackle two years to learn how to play the trap by himself.

On the double-team block, step straight up the field and punch the hips to avoid the hips of the offensive linemen coming together. On the second step continue upfield, splitting the double-team and find the second key. If you start to give up movement, drop the outside knee and tackle the outside lineman. Do not drop to the ground unless you absolutely have to.

On the scoop block step straight upfield and punch the hip. On the second step, step down with the lineman and rip the backside arm through the scoop blocker while still penetrating.

With the down block we still step straight upfield and punch the hip. On the second step, feel the pressure of the down block and "Run the Hoop" finding the second key. This is running around the block, but if you stay tight this is a good technique. If you get pinned by the down block, fight across the face of spin over the top of the down block.

When our linebackers line up we want them to use a progression to make the play. We key the backfield for direction and flow. We play and secure the primary gap first. We want to get in the gap and play vertical. If he doesn't make the play, make it go somewhere else.

We read four flows. The Mike linebacker shades strong most of the time at a depth of 5 yards. If we get double tight ends, he shades weak. That is for vision so he can see the midline player. The Sam and Will linebackers are at 5 yards deep, sneaking up to 4.5. The Sam and Will linebackers line up in 50 techniques. Their inside leg is splitting the crotch of the tackle. They always key the near back. We pick the five best plays our opponents run and that is all we look at for the week we are preparing for them. From those five plays we key the guy who gets the football the most. In split backs the Mike linebacker keys through the quarterback for directional opening to the nearest flow. His first step is at the directional opening of the quarterback. After that he goes to the immediate flow. If we see the isolation play, that is a full-flow play for us. The Will linebacker is taking on the isolation block with his outside arm free. We force the iso back to the inside. The Mike linebacker cleans up in the B gap. We number the gaps 1, 3, 5, and 9. The Will linebacker is a 31-gap player. If the ball comes at him, he plays 3 gap. Ball away from him, he plays 1 gap. The Mike linebacker is a 13 player. Ball at him, he plays 1. If it goes away, he plays 3 gap. The Sam linebacker is a 51 player. Ball at him, he plays 5; and ball away, he plays 1 gap.

We tell the Sam and Will linebackers on full flow toward to go fill the hole. On flow away, stack on the nose or tackle. There is no shuffle. It is a 45-degree angle at the tail of our nose tackle. The trouble area is the tackle getting on the Will linebacker on plays away. We want no shuffle to prevent being cut off. On a play away from the linebacker, he rips inside the tackle and squeezes the guards. Full flow has the threat of a cutback.

Fast flow has no threat of a cutback. That is the toss sweep, speed option, and plays like that. We turn the linebackers loose and let them run. Any vertical seam they see, they get in it and go after the ball. The Sam linebacker on flow to him, blows the C gap. The Mike linebacker picks the first vertical seam and fires. The Will linebacker runs over the top and goes vertical only when he has to.

I'm out of time but there is one coverage I want to show you. It has made a huge difference for us. It is our 2-back coverage, which we call COVER 8. We sold out to stopping the run when we went to the 4-3 defense. We wanted a coverage that gave us an extra player. If the offense has two backs in the backfield, 90 percent of the time we are in COVER 8. The safeties align outside the number 2 receiver in an outside shade. They are going to do what we call "patting their feet." The safeties are 10 yards deep and the corners are 5 yards deep. We start every defensive coverage at these depths. That is our disguise.

The safeties line up at 10 yards and sneak up to 8 yards before the ball is snapped. They pat their feet and key the number 2 receiver. Obviously we are thinking run.

 





Page 232

In a Cover 8 the Will linebacker can go over the top and a safety fills in behind him. If flow comes to the safety they run the alley like crazy. The backside safety is keying the backside tackle through the near back. He is keying the tackle for direction and run or pass. He pats his feet and immediately goes vertical to replace the Will linebacker, if he reads run. He is the guy the offense cannot account for. He can react and tackle the play for a 3-yard gain.

The strong safety is called "BARON." On flow away from him he is replacing the Sam linebacker. If there is outside flow away from him, he reacts down the line at 8 yards depth, looking for the immediate cutback outside of the tackle. He helps fill in behind the playside safety.

If the number 2 receiver goes vertical, it becomes a matchup zone. The corners are aligned inside. They take the post away and force the fade.

Coaches, it's over. I'm out of time. I'll be here quite some time and I'll talk to you about anything we do. Good luck to you.

Zone Defense from Goal Line to Goal Line

University of Georgia

This topic came up as a result of a conversation with one of the foremost high school coaches in Georgia, Dan Pitts down at Mary Persons High School in Forsyth. When Coach Ray Lamb asked me to speak at this clinic quite a while back, he asked me to pick a topic. I was fortunate enough to speak at the Georgia Athletic Coaches Association last summer. I did an hour-and-one-half lecture on individual drills and techniques. I will talk at our clinic about the two-deep and some other things. Again, I am speaking to a lot of the Georgia high school coaches. I am a little perplexed, because I want to give you something to take away from here.

Coach Pitts came up to visit with me one day. He asked me about zone coverages. He felt he needed to blitz more, but he wanted to play man to man. I started showing him the type of blitzes we run. Every time I showed him a blitz, we were playing some type of man coverage, or we were in a combo or nickel package. Coach Pitts just sat there shaking his head. He did not like what he was hearing. We talked about running the blitz with zone coverage. We agreed that this was nothing new to NFL teams because they have been doing it for a long time. They can do that by having great personnel.

I coached at Maryland for 10 years, and we played Penn State each of those 10 years. They played a lot of zone coverage with the blitz. Coach Pitts liked that idea a lot better, because he liked to play zone coverage. We solved some of his problems, and he went back to Forsyth. I sat there later and decided that I would make my topic zone defense.

will cover a number of zones. The first thing we must talk about is this: What do you want to get out of playing zone coverage? There are a lot of different zones. What does the zone give you? What do you get out of it? I listed the things that we want out of the zone.

Ten Commandments of Zone Defense

1. There is more than one defender to the ball.

In a zone defense, everyone looks at the ball. That is the number one thing you must do in defense, regardless of the level you are in. People who play good defense always have more than one person to the ball. That is the way we start out everything in the secondary. There are four of us back deep, and there is only one ball. We have a number of drills that we used to teach our players to get to the ball. That is the first thing we want to do. We want more than one defender to the ball. That will help us stop the deep pass. That is the second thing you want to do. If we get more than one defender to the ball, we will not get the deep ball. The third thing we want to do on defense is to stop the yardage after the catch. This has brought about the West Coast offense, which is throwing the 5-yard pass to Jerry Rice over the middle and having him run for 50 yards down the field. After every game we chart yards gained after the catch. That is significant to the outcome of the game. We do not want to give up a 5-yard pass and a 50-yard run. That is 55 yards. We want them to earn those yards. We do not want them to get any yardage after the catch. Other things in these 10 commandments are associated with our philosophy of yardage after the catch.

I listened to John Madden comment in a play-off game after our season was over. He said that most NFL teams were defending the West Coast offense by staying in their zones. They let the receivers catch the ball underneath and then knock the hell out of the receivers. That is what the zone defense was designed for in the first place.

2. Defend areas of the field. 

We are going to put our players in certain areas of the field. Why? Because we want to defend that area. That is what we want to defend. If we play a three-deep zone, we are going

 





Page 234

to put a man in the middle and a man in each outside zone. That is where they are going to stay. They stay in that area of the field. If we want to play a two-deep zone, we will set those corners outside of the wideouts, and that is where they are going to stay. If we are anticipating short passes on 3rd and 15, we may drop our linebackers back to certain spots on the field. We have a limited rush and five certain people in areas of the field, and we still have three deep.

3. Receivers do not know where the lick is coming from. 

Receivers love man-to-man coverage. When the defender gets up tight on the receiver, that receiver can't wait to run his pattern. Do you know why? Because he knows who is going to hit him. He knows where the lick is coming from. He can take the lick where he wants to take it. When that receiver comes outside and the defense scatters, he does not know who is going to hit him. That is another reason we play the zone.

4. Different zones change receivers' routes. 

The wide receiver comes outside, and all of a sudden there is a man in front of him and one behind that defender. Now he is reading two deep. Whatever was called in the huddle, they are going to convert. Now you get into the communication process between the quarterback and the wideout. The receiver has to change his route because he can't run the hook. He has a defender in that area.

If we are in a two-deep look and all of sudden we switch to a three-deep look, the receiver has to change his route again. By using different zones, we make receivers change their routes. That leads us to the next commandment.

5. Different zones change the pass patterns. 

Is it a five-short zone; is it a three-deep zone? Is it a two-deep zone? Is it a strong zone or a weak zone? The offense will have to change what they are doing, or we will be successful against them.

6. Zone coverages dictate where the ball will be thrown. 

When we line up our defenders in certain areas of the field, we take those areas away by our alignment. It is called an alignment advantage. We take away certain patterns. We want to force the offense in play selection. To be successful, they have to try to get to the flat to get some yardage. They could try to run to the seam and hope that the quarterback can drive the ball into the receiver. We want to dictate where they throw the football. In practice, we work to see whether the offense is throwing the ball where we want them to throw it. If they are not throwing the ball to the weakest part of that zone, then we are not executing the defense the way we should. You cannot let them throw the ball into the teeth of your zone. If you do that, they will beat you to death. We want to make them go the long road. We want to make the offense put the ball where we want it put.

7. Changes in zone coverages confuse the quarterback. 

Defend the pass from the eye of the quarterback or the man throwing the ball. Don't defend the pass by looking at the pass patterns from your office on the screen. Defend it from the eyes of the man throwing the football. That is why there are only five or six great quarterbacks in the NFL. There are only five or six of them who have both the eyes and the arm. Lots of them have the eyes, but they do not have the arm. A lot of them can see where the ball should go but can't get it there. On the other hand, you have some guys who have the arm and can get the ball down the field, but they can also read or determine on their drop where the ball should be placed against that defense. We look at things in college by the kind of throw the man can make. This year, we had to play against two quarterbacks who have it all: the quarterback at Florida and the quarterback at Tennessee. We did not have much success against them. We had some success against some of the other teams because their quarterbacks were not able to see the opening and then do something about it.

8. Blitz and defend with zone coverages. 

Attack the protection scheme. That is what I was telling you about in my conversation with Coach Pitts. He was not comfortable with man coverage. I showed him a couple of simple blitzes that would give the protection he was playing against problems, yet he could still be secure in what he liked, which was the three-deep secondary. I will go over this later. Anyone in the NFL that blitzes and plays zone coverages gets a big raise or a title.

 





Page 235

That is the deal right now. The reason they do that is because it attacks the protection scheme. The offense has problems because they do not know who is coming or who is dropping. When they have problems protecting the quarterback, they also have problems with the throwing lanes for the quarterback to throw the ball out of. The quarterbacks throw out of a vision lane. When those lanes change, those quarterbacks have to change. In the NFL, if you can rush the quarterback, you can stop them. If you can't rush them, you are not going to stop them.

9. The zone defenses offer advantages as the field shortens. 

This is something I have talked about for years. When I first started coaching, we were not very good down deep. The reason was that we did not practice defending the red zone. We talked about it, and we discussed strategy, but we just went over it. We did not spend time down in the red zone. The reason that the zone defense is good in the red zone is because the offense only uses certain passes down deep. You can get the interception down deep, and you can get your safeties involved in run support. You can actually be in a nine-man front without subbing for the nine men.

10. Zone personnel is less important. 

You just do not have to have as good a player to play the zone. This is especially true if you get good at playing zone. f you are going to play man to man, you have to have one thing and one thing only: That is makeup speed. Sooner or later, you are going to get beat, and you better have someone lined up back deep who can make up for it. If you have four players who can fly, you can play a lot of man-to-man coverage. I have some players on defense who can fly, but they can't fly as fast as those guys from Florida. That is why we have to play some zone. We also have to play some man. Zone is a personnel thing. You have a better chance of getting a good cover with the personnel that you have in the zone than you do in man. When you go man to man, you have to depend on the blitzes getting there to cover up for your coverage problems.

Those are the 10 commandments of zone defense. I am going to go through 10 zones. All of these facets are going to make up these coverages. You can take three or four of these and make up your own coverages. You can pull out two or three of these and make them your cover two, or whatever you want it to be. I will explain these to you as best I can in a short period of time.

The first cover is universal. It is what everyone plays. It is three deep, four short-strong. This was played back about 20 years ago. There never was such a thing as a weak zone. Basically, what we want to do is to go three deep. We are going to put the two corners and free safety in the deep thirds. Now I am going to give you an overview of all zone coverages. I will not be able to go over every detail of each coverage. I have the diagrams drawn up for an odd alignment, but I did not put the linemen down.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTSTRONG

Also, I have them drawn up for an even alignment, which has three linebackers. Basically, all this on the diagram is a three-deep zone. We can go through all of the commandments again and see that we are three deep. We are taking away the deep areas and the underneath areas of the field by lining up in those areas. We do not want to give up a completion in those areas. We are not going to give up a deep ball.

We have the same three deep with four short strong with the four-man front. We have three deep, we have four short, and we are in a strong zone. We have the even front.

 





Page 236

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTSTRONG

The other thing you must understand is that the offense will attack you two ways. They will attack you horizontally or, as Al Davis says, vertically. When you are thinking about zone coverages, those are the only two words you should think about. When you watch your opponent, you ask this question: Are they attacking us horizontally or vertically? In the old days, when Al Davis was coaching the Raiders, he did not have a horizontal pattern in his play book. He was verticalboom! If you watch the West Coast offense, it is all horizontal. Three deep and four short is a good defense for the vertical patterns. However, it is tough when they attack you horizontally.

Next is our three deep, four short-weak. Now we are going to take the zone, and we are going to roll it to the weak side. We are going to put that corner in that weak flat. We bring the free safety over to play the outside one third. The strong safety comes over to the middle, and the strong corner drops back to play the outside one third. We drop the strong backer and the two inside linebackers.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTWEAK

You can disguise these looks. That is a whole can of worms in itself. They have three down linemen, they have four linebackers, and they are in three-deep coverage. That is one hell of a defense from an eightman front. That defense came into being with Monte Kiffin and the eagle defense when he was at Nebraska and Arkansas. What they did was to slide the line. Now, the strong safety who played the strong flat before is going to come back and take the deep middle. The corner who played the outside one third is going to play the flat area.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTWEAK

You can see that the free safety will play the outside one third on the weak side, and the corner to the field is going to play that outside one third. That is a weak zone.

In the strong zone, before, we had no way to harass the wide receiver. Now, with this coverage we are going to harass the wideout. We could not do that in the strong coverage. Now we are going to dictate what pattern they are going to run. Before, they have been hurting us by dragging their tight end, hooking or curling the X end, or putting the back out into the flat, when we were in our conventional strong three-deep. That would be a horizontal pattern. At the time, they do not have a pattern. The minute we harass the split end and cover the flat, we have three over two.

That is the other thing you must understand about pass defense. It is either three over two or two over

 





Page 237

one. That is how you defend the pass. Those combinations depend on whether it is a vertical or horizontal pass route that you are facing.

In the four-man line, we drop the backers to the strong side. Now where does the offense have to come with the ball? They have to come to the strong-side flat.

Next, we will look at three deep, five shortstrong. We are going to set in a strong zone. The corners have the outside one thirds. The free safety comes to the deep middle. The strong safety takes the strong flat. We are going to attack the horizontal and vertical passing game. This is the defense that the NFL uses to harass teams that pass for the 5 yards. They use a three-man rush and play five short with three deep. This is very good to stop any horizontal pattern. On the other hand, we have three deep. Most teams would send the two wideouts on a deep route. The NFL defensive teams started using this defense to slow the two wideouts down. That enabled them to stop any receiver from going deep. This is the defense that changed the rules of the NFL.

THREE DEEP, FIVE SHORTSTRONG

When Green Bay got New England in long-yardage situations, they went to this package. The ran the twist stunt up front and shut them down. They had no place to throw the football. You can run the same scheme with the three linebackers, but it is not worth going over. It takes too much teaching to get the job done.

Next we go to our three deep, four short, with a spot defender. Remember when I talked about taking an area of the field away from the offense? What happened is this. Good offensive coordinators started lining up their good receivers in different positions. They would move them around. The 49ers did this with Rice. You have to come up with something that will combat this move. We came up with the spot defender. We want to do it in relation to the formation or the motion or what was going on at the time.

When I was at Maryland, we had to play against Herman Moore. They had a good offensive scheme. They moved him all around to get him open on the passes. You never knew where he was going to line up. We did not have anyone as fast as he was, and they still had a great horizontal passing game to the other receivers. This is where we used our spot defender. We would line up our spot where Herman would line up, ust as if we were in two deep. As soon as the motion started, the spot moved to the area outside the tight end at 12 yards. We moved the two corners back to the outside one thirds. The free safety came back and played deep middle. The four linebackers dropped off, and we played four short with a spot defender.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTSPOT DEFENDER

We had a choice to drop or blitz the strong inside linebacker. We would mix it up: drop him or blitz him. We still had the two tackles and nose to rush. Early in the game, this is what we would do. We would bring the strong safety to the spot. The corner would drop. The strong-side backer would drive to the outside. The

 





Page 238

reason we went to that particular spot was because that is where Herman Moore was catching all of his passes. He would line up at different spots, but he would still end up at that spot. That is where we had to get in order to stop the pass.

The next zone is what everyone is using now. It is our two deep, five short-hard. We are going to play the two corners hard. The word after the underneath coverage tells the corners how to play. Hard means they are going to play hard on the run, play collision on the wide receiver, and play that area. If we are in a 50 defense, this is how it looks.

TWO DEEP, FIVE SHORTHARD

We keep the two safeties deep, and they set in the middle of the field, with each man responsible for one half of the field. It is a two-deep with five short, and we are playing hard. Why are we getting tricky? Because we have the horizontal game shut off. We have five short defenders underneath. They should not be able to complete anything in the 10- to 12-yard areas. We are going to collision the two wideouts. This will make them alter their pattern. Now the dilemma comes. What is open? What is open? The vertical game. Now they are going to attack the area between the two safeties. Also, they will attack the areas to the deep outside. I call the area to the outside the side pocket. Have you ever played pool? That is where they want to put the pass. How are they going to get it there? They are going to get it there two ways. They can have the wide receivers release inside and then come back on a corner route. The other way is to come straight out, make the corner miss on the collision, and then get down to the pocket for the fade route. Those are about the only two ways they can get deep against you.

What are we going to do in the secondary when we are in this defense? We have to work the heck out of defending those patterns. We have to work hard to get a good collision on the two wideouts. We have to be able to collision and still get back on the corner. The safeties have to be ready to break on the ball.

The other route we face is the tight end coming down the middle. The linebacker has to get a piece of that tight end as he comes downfield. That is easy to do if it is a drop-back pass. If it is play action, it is a problem for the linebacker. We can change it up as far as who and how we drop our linebackers. This is the way the offense is going to attack the two-deep, five-short, hard defense. They are going to try to get three-deep receivers on your two-deep defenders. On the back side, we have three defenders on their one receiver. On the front side, we have four on their two receivers. I know that there are a lot of one-back sets today. I do not have time to go over that, but this is the basic way we play that zone.

On the 4-3 look, we have three linebackers in the game. Now we have two deep, five shortsoft.

TWO DEEP, FIVE SHORTSOFT

 





Page 239

We still have to defend the side pockets. The corners are going to collision the wide receivers, except this time we want them to work back at an angle so that they are at the bottom of that side pocket as the ball is thrown. This allows our two safeties to be tighter and stronger in the middle.

We get a good hit against the tight end from the linebacker on this look. He can read pass or run from his position. This 4-3 front is more conducive to handling the man down the middle. Now the corners come back and pattern-read. They form a visual triangle from the wide receiver to the near back in the backfield. They slide out of the area and get back to the bottom of the side pocket. They must be ready to react to anything coming in their zone. They should be able to help on the fade route. The two safeties know the corners are sagging. They know the fade has to come in deeper, and that gives them more time to play the fade. They will stick more to the inside and help us there.

This defense is really big when they move the tailback into the slot on the back side. Now they have two receivers, and we have three defenders. We have to win. We've got to win. On the strong side, they have two receivers, and we have three defenders. We have to win. The reason I like two deep is because we force them to run to certain areas and in certain patterns. We continue to get more than one person to the ball. We can practice and practice and practice and get good at it. It takes a lot of the passing game away from the offense. It gives you great perimeter support. In essence, it gives you nine men up front. If they run the screen pass, you have it turned in. If they run the toss or the option play, you have a corner outside. In 1972 and 1973, no one played two deep. They did play two deep with man coverage underneath. Now you can see this coverage about 90 percent of the time. You see this coverage and a weak zone coverage. Those are the two predominant coverages in college football today.

Let me get to the last coverage. This is the zone blitz with a three-deep coverage. I took this off one of our game tapes. It is what you see from the Carolina Panthers. They defend the pass from the eyes of the quarterback. So do we. The quarterback comes out, and what does he see? Two deep! He sees two linebackers inside and a five-man line. In essence, it is a run defense. From this look, the quarterback thinks he can throw the ball deep. He thinks he can throw to the flat. He thinks he can do a lot with the ball.

ZONE BLITZTHREE DEEP

When the ball gets snapped, it is just like a covey of quail. Our defenders are going all over the place. As soon as the ball touches the quarterback, he looks up, and now he sees a three-deep secondary. The nose and tackle stunt on the strong side. Now, on the short side, the backer is in the A gap. The tackle drops off the line to the hook zone. The outside linebackers are rush and contain players. They make contact with the man on the line, keeping the outside arm free. They are going to keep the quarterback in that pocket. By doing all of this switching, they have disrupted all of the passing lanes that the quarterback has worked against. It no longer is a basic five-man rush or even a basic four-man rush. He doesn't know where the passing lane is with everyone moving around. This is only one blitz. There may be 50 of them.

What happens if you are playing man to man and you get beat deep? Everyone looks at the secondary coach and says, ''He is a dumb ass.'' Now, this zone blitz made me a hell of a lot smarter. It may have kept me in coaching 10 more years. Now when the defensive coordinator calls that blitz, I am up in the press box drinking Coke. Why? I have three deep. The

 





Page 240

quarterback does not know who is dropping to cover deep. When the receivers come out, we have people in the zones that they have not accounted for. That is why sometimes the quarterback will throw the ball right to a tackle. The quarterback sees the linebacker come and thinks that area is open. You can see the dilemma this has brought into play.

A few years ago this is what Penn State ran. They would bring their strong safety up close to the line and blitz him. They called him the hero.

HERO BLITZ

Teams would see the hero up tight, and they would check off and throw the quick route. Penn State would send the linebacker outside and pick off the pass. To me, this was the first zone blitz. It is amazing what you can do with this defense. This is something you can do in high school football. You can play three deep. Some of you may have been using this same type of defense. Remember the 10 commandments: personnelyour personnel! You may not have had the personnel to play man coverage. It does not have to be out of a 50 front. Carolina Panthers just so happened to be running that front. We watch a lot of tape. This is something that can help us. That is our zone blitz.

I am going to put the videotape on. I will point out the 10 commandments on defense. [Video]

Linebacker Drills And Techniques

Houston Oilers

I appreciate the opportunity to get a chance to visit with you. I want to make this as informative as I can. I want to make this as fun as I can. I understand that it is a poor meeting when I'm doing all the talking. I feel that same way when I am involved with the players. A meeting has to be an extension of the field. I don't play anymore. They do. They play the games on Sunday, Saturday afternoons, and Friday nights. They have to know as much about what you do so that they are better able to play the game.

One of the most complimentary things that can be said about me is, "You still think like a high school coach." That is still said about me when I get into the personnel meetings on whether a guy can play or not. Right now we are going through all that with the college draft.

If the kid makes plays at the high school level, he'll make plays at the college level, if given a chance to play. If the guy is a play maker at the college level, he will make plays at our level, too. It will happen that way because play makers are play makers. Some of the best football coaches I have every coached with to this day were the high school coaches that I played for, the high school coaches on my staff, and the coaches that are still there in Kansas City.

It was easier for me to get on with the Houston Oilers than it was for me to become a head football coach in the state of Texas. I do think that there are some great high school football coaches in Texas. Some of the worst coaches I've been associated with are at the pro level. There are some weak coaches in pro ball. There are some baby-sitters here. They think the guys can go ahead, line up, and play. All they have to do is keep them out of trouble and make sure his car gets washed. It doesn't happen that way. These guys still have to be coached. They crave to be coached. We are going to coach them from when they get out of the Lexus until they get back into to it at the end of the day. That s the kind of staff Jeff Fisher has put together. Before I get long and drawn out with a lot of things dealing with linebacker play, I'm going to hit this really quick. I'm going to talk about philosophy. I would much rather be sitting where you are than doing this. That is what I have missed for the last 10 years since I've been at this level. I miss the clinics, fellowship, and the interchange of ideas. Understand, at the pro level we don't tell anybody crap. We don't tell each other anything, because that is taking food out of my kid's mouth. The guys that will get me fired are the guys at the Chargers, Lions, and Cowboys. We are not telling anybody anything. When I sat out there, I used to hate all that philosophical bullcrap. I will be brief with this.

I do believe this. If you are a young football coach, the most important thing in coaching is your philosophy, not your scheme. It is more about changing the behavior of that young man than it is about that scheme. I do believe it is important. That is why I'm going to talk a little about this to start with. After that, I'll get into some drills. I've got a film at the end that I'll show. After you watch that film, you're going to say, "He ain't any better than me." I am you. I have coached junior high, high school, college, and pro football. The reason I'm still at this level is because I'm going to coach the players every single day as hard as I can coach them.

I had a guy say to me, "You need to understand: I'm an individual. You need to treat me as an individual." He needed to understand to do it our way. We had to give him more than one way to be successful. But if he thought about being an individual, he needed to go to an individual sport. This is a team sport.

Let's talk really quickly about linebackers. I've done this at every level I've been at. As soon as the game is over, I come in and turn the film on. I ask myself two questions. The first question is, "Am I coaching that specific technique?" I ask that question especially if there was a bad play or something negative that

happened. I'm going to study that play and find out how and why it broke down. If I'm the problem, I have to change it. I have to go back and find a better technique to allow that kid to be successful. If the answer to question number one is no, then I ask question number two. If I'm not coaching that technique, I must be allowing it to happen over and over again because I'm seeing that same stuff week after week. That's it. If you will live by that creed, you will start to see a change in your players.

I talk in clinics across the country. I talk to corporations, businessmen, salesmen, coaches, and players about goal setting and success. I talk about what you have to do in order to improve yourself from poor to average, from average to good, from good to great. To have those good years, you have to be able to effect change in the people around you. You are an average coach if you can't effect change. You are a baby-sitter. You are monitoring those players for two or three hours. There are lots of ways to go about effecting change. Some of these things are positive, and some are negative.

Individual drills are important to linebackers. I want to talk to you about my beliefs. Some of the exhibitors in the back aren't going to like this. It is my philosophy on coaching aids. Jack Pardee taught me this. I came from high school to the college level coaching linebackers. Jack was a Hall-of-Fame pro linebacker, and he was looking over my shoulder at everything I did. My philosophy is this, and he taught it to me: I am not really big on a lot of coaching aids during the season. You have to have certain dummies. You have to have a few cones and sleds. I understand that, but that sled is not going to knock his jock off on Friday night. Jack told me to get all that stuff done during the off-season. He told me I could have one drill with the coaching aid. "Anything past that, and you are out of here." He said he wanted to see them tackling, shedding, striking, covering, and running. He wanted to see them do those things the way they were going to do it on Saturday afternoon. I still use a few things, but not many, and only one a day.

We have a 20-minute, live, get-after-your-butt, special-teams period. That pretty much has our players warmed up before we start the individual periods. Still, there are a few guys each day who are not involved in the special-teams period who need to be warmed up. I'll start the individual period out with some sort of a warm-up. I'm going to emphasize stance and the first step as much as I can at the starting point of that warm-up period. I coach eyes, stance, and first step as they gradually warm up.

From there, I am going to some kind of full-speed, ballistic footwork drill. I want a change-of-direction and quick-movement drill to get all the muscles loosened up before we get into the contact period.

Every day, we are going to do certain things. It may be in a different order, but we do it every day. We do an upper-body strike-and-shed drill. We do a lower-body strike-and-shed drill. They learn how to get in a fit position and how to strike with their upper body and shed. They learn how to play the cut block. They strike and shed that block. They are going to learn how to play football through a few coaching aids and a few other bodies.

If you want to know whether your team was ready to play in a game in which you just got your butt kicked, look at the tackling. The number one indicator of whether your team was prepared and ready to play that night is tackling. If they tackled like crap, they weren't prepared. If you are a defensive football coach, you know that doesn't come naturally. Tackling is not natural. It is something you have to work on every single day. I am at the NFL level, and we tackle every day. I'm 38 years old. I've got guys as old as I am, but we are going to tackle every day. You have to emphasize the same points in tackling over and over.

As a defensive football coach, our number one thing is "don't let them score and get the ball back for the offense." That is it. It is not a hard game. Turnovers don't happen by accident. You have to teach guys how to strip the ball and knock it out. You have to teach them how to intercept the ball. Players in our three major position areas are not allowed to come out of the individual period unless the head coach sees a turnover drill every single day.

I'm very proud that our linebackers are recognized by the league as being the best cover linebackers. I think the reason for that is that I coached in the secondary for a number of years. I couldn't understand why the linebacker coach couldn't get his linebackers to do the same things that our strong safety was doing. The outside linebacker is the same cover man as the strong safety. The linebackers and secondary should be doing the same drill.

A speed turn is used to save time in coverage. When the defensive back is running on the hip of a receiver, he is inside and playing on the upfield hip. The receiver will club, throw the defensive back up the field, and come underneath him. If the defensive back takes the step where he got clubbed, takes another step, then opens up and drives on the receiver, that is three steps. What we teach is to take one step, make a quick head turn, and then come right back on the receiver. We teach our linebacker to do that, and we practice it.

When I came back to the linebackers after coaching the defensive back, I started teaching these big-bodied guys those techniques. They thought I was crazy. They looked like cows falling out of the back of a pickup truck. They were horrible looking. Now they rival the defensive backs in their technique.

We do a catching drill of some type. How many times does the linebacker get his hands on the football and not finish the catch? Most of the time, the guys in the secondary are receivers who got kicked off the offense. They couldn't catch the damn thing in the first place. The linebackers need the work even more than the defensive backs. Most of those linebackers wished they were tight ends catching touchdown passes. They got moved to defense because they couldn't catch a cold running buck-naked in a rainstorm. Because of that, we have to work on their hands every day.

We will pass-rush every day. Those are the drills we do every day. Our individual period every day starts out being 20 minutes. You are bullcrapping yourself if you think we ever get 20 minutes. The first drill that the head coach cuts so that you have time to add whatever he is putting in is the individual period and special-team period. To get all your individual period in, you have to do your drills in combination. Don't do single, one-specific-coaching-area drills. Do two or three specific areas in one drill. Jeff Fisher tells me I have 20 minutes in individual period today, but eight minutes later when he blows the horn to go to the next period, I've got my individual drills all done. I'm still going to do those things that I told you we do every day in eight minutes.

When we get finished, there is a lot of hard breathing going on. We go 100 miles an hour. Let's say we are going over bags today to work on agility. We work on our step-overs and -ups and changes of direction. We work on their eyes while they are going over the dummies. Get in a position where you can see their eyes. If you stand behind them and watch their butts, you are stupid. You have to coach through their eyes to know what they are seeing.

They go down the bags stepping over them. Then they go up and down them changing directions. They get on the back side of the bags, and they work on protecting the near arm. They play same arm and same leg protecting against the cut. When they get to the end of the bags, there is a guy there who jumps at them like a frog and tries to cut them. The linebacker plays his hand on the head and turns it. Where the head goes, the body follows. After that, there is a cross-the-bow tackle. I work on agility and cut-block mechanics, get a live rep on the cut block, and make a cross-the-bow tackle. But he still doesn't get an "attaboy" unless he strips the ball on the tackle.

On the tape, you will see us working on the low part of a seven-man sled. We work on upper-body strike. If I work on upper-body strike, I have to concentrate on the hand positioning also. The man who works his hands inside will win the battle. The thumbs have to be up. We have the big muscle groups of the upper body involved. If the thumbs get inside and the wrist rolls back, the wrists get jammed. The plexus of nerves across the tops of the arms shuts off, and you have no upper-body strength. We extend on the dummy with our hands and violently shed it as we go to the next dummy. At the end of the sled, I'll give the guy coming

 





Page 244

down the sled a live cut block. He has to play the cut live by turning the head, playing the back pad, and flattening him out. The last thing he does is the tackle. We work on strike, explosion, hand placement, and getting his hip across.

You have to be creative. Do combination drills. Don't tell me you don't have enough time. You don't have enough time if you are stupid. There is no place for stupidity in the game. You have to think to stay ahead of the head coach who is going to cut your period short. He is going to fire you if you can't coach. He'll call you in at the end of the year and tell you, "We are going in a different direction." I must get the things taught, regardless of whether he gives me enough time or not.

Here is some philosophical BS for you young coaches. These are the principles of good defense. I believe this and have done it from the junior high level up. (1) You have to have great communication in your defense. I'm going to show you something here in a minute on game planning that will make you shake your head. You won't believe we do it. Communication is vital to defensive football team. You have to communicate, and everyone has to be on the same page.

(2) We coach techniques and give them different types. However, the players have to make the decision on what specific technique to use on a particular down. As an example, I have a 225 linebacker. He tries to play "hat and hands" and gets his hands inside on a 340-pound, 7' 9" offensive guard. He gets engulfed and taken down. The officials only call holding when it gets really bad. I'm not going to teach him to play a "hat and hands" technique in this situation. I'm going to teach him a flipper technique. He delivers the flipper and knocks the crap out of that guard. He gets under his pads and gets his body in the hole. He may get buried, but at least the ball is cutting back.

(3) Can you effect change? If you want to know the difference between being a good coach and a great coach, this is it. You can't affect their size or speed, but you can effect change. If you can't, you don't need to be coaching. You decide who plays. If he doesn't play at the effort level you want, why in the hell is he playing? That is one thing I want said about me. When people see my linebackers play, they say, "Those guys play all out." If they don't, you will see the next guy going in. I'll get a fresh one in there who is going to bust his butt to get to the ball. The guy I took out comes over yelling and MFing me about his incentive clause for his number of plays. I tell him that if he wants to play and make that incentive clause, he better bust his butt to the ball. If you take a lazy step, you are over by me. He is not going to play unless he plays all out.

In 1993, we were the number one special team in the league. We were very simple as far as scheme. I had seven rookies on that team. We were number one because of effort. They flew to the ball with reckless abandon. You can make that happen. It is a sin if you allow them to take lazy steps.

(4) Intelligence is what we would all like. We would like to have smart players, but I've coached some dumb ones, just as you have. If the dumb guy can play, you've got to find a place for him. Chuck Knox told me this, "If that kid is good enough to play, then you better be smart enough to coach him." It has nothing to do with the kid's intelligence; it has to do with yours. For the ones who aren't very smart, you have to find a way for them to succeed. If they know their own element of what will make the defense successful, they have to do it.

We are a pressure-package defense. We are the only defense in the United States at any level that has the last say. Most offensive teams say they have the last say because they have the automatic system. I'll tell you really quickly how that comes about. Blitzing pressure teams are selling tickets right now. If you have an offensive-minded head coach, he wants you to get the ball back to him in a hurry. I don't want a 14play drive going on while the All-American quarterback stands on the sideline with his thumb up his butt. The instructions are clear from the head coach: Get the ball back.

If you are a good blitzing team, you have to do these things.

 





Page 245

(a) You have to disguise. You don't want the quarterback to know what you are in before the ball is snapped. Make sure your pre-snap is not what you are going to be in after the ball is snapped.

(b) Timing is important to the blitzing team. You want to be able to hit the line of scrimmage on the run. If the quarterback sees you creeping, he will chicken out and get rid of the ball. Get the snap count to help with timing. Teams that use motion usually snap the ball at certain points in the motion. Get that from the scouting films. You can use that as a tip-off. Start your blitz when the motion is getting to the area where the ball is snapped.

(c) You have to collapse the pocket with inside heat. Buddy Ryan would fire you if he saw an inside pass rusher use a swim move. He wanted the gap ripped and the pocket collapsed.

(d) Speed pressure comes from the outside. If the quarterback can step up in the pocket, that is the place where he can escape. If there is no collapse of the pocket, the blitz breaks down. If the speed blitz comes from the inside gap, the ends better be containing.

(e) You have to take away the quick inside passing game. Force the offense to run outs and fades. Don't let them throw inside posts and curls.

We are a 4-3 football team, and we like to get into the eight-man force game. We are predominantly an over-and-under shifted team. If we are playing a shade technique on the center and a 3 technique away from the tight end, that is an under front. If we play a 3 technique to the tight end and a shade on the back side, that is an over front. The only way teams get us into a true 4-3 look is if they balance up.

Offensive coordinators who see a team that kicks the front one way or the other balance up to see if the defense will balance up. This game is not hard. Coaches make it hard. I guess we want to promote our intelligence. If the defense doesn't balance, the quarterback simply counts right and left and runs to the side with the least number of people on it. They use the "check with me" call. What we do is balance up and force you to run to a personnel mismatch rather than a numbers mismatch.

Ninety-nine percent of the time when we break the huddle at the Houston Oilers, I don't know what we are going to play. If I go back and coach at the high school level, I will run this package and system. I'll have to simplify it somewhat, but they can do exactly what we do. We have one of four calls in the huddle. Our game plan is the most important thing we do. We have a two-back formation page. It has every two-back formation known to man on it. We have terminology that describes our communication. The number 212 to us means two wide receivers, one tight end, and two backs. The first number is how many wide receivers, the second is how many tight ends, and the third is how many backs. Red means split backs. Flop is what Buddy Ryan called the slot set, and that stuck with us. Brown is a weak back tilt in the backfield. Brown-up is moving the weak back up into a tight slot position off the weak tackle. I-over is taking the fullback out of the I and offsetting him strong. I-under is moving the fullback the other way. If we moved the fullback up into the slot position, it was I-under flop or I-over flop. Blue is a strong back tilt, and blue-flop is moving him into the slot position. These are all the adjustments you can make with two backs in the backfield.

Across the top of our game-plan sheet we have AFC. That stands for automatic front and coverage. We have a computer system. I brought one of the charts we use. The one I brought is for the red set, or splitback look. On this sheet we have every run from this formation and the hole they run into. The passes are recorded at the top of the sheet. A split-back formation in our league is primarily a passing set, but they may run a little lead draw strong and weak.

This set is mainly a pass and not a lot of run. We play a seven-man front to it. We are going to take away your wide receivers and force you to beat us with your tight end or your backs. If you run to the open side, we are going to kick the front weak. If you like to run to the tight side, we kick the front strong. We have decided whether you run the opposite of the scouting report; we have won that down. The offense is doing something they really don't want to do. If an offense

 





Page 246

is multiple, it has tendencies. We do a five- to seven-game breakdown on people we play. In the secondary, we are going to roll the coverage to your best receiver or where you like to throw the ball.

If the offense comes out in a running set, we get into the eight-man front and stop the run. The quickest way to get beat is not being able to stop the run. We have been number one, two, or three in the NFL since I've been at the Houston Oilers in rushing defense. If you are a tight-end-running team, we kick over. If you run to the split end, we kick under. We have one more than you can block either way, and we will kick your butt.

Our BF stands for blitz the formation. I call a coach who just picks a blitz a Rolodex coach. If you happen to call the wrong blitz, you have a corner somewhere on that field trying to cover their best receiver all over the field. You have lost. We want to blitz and guarantee a hit on the quarterback.

We study your protection. If we know that you are going to get three out to the strong side, we use that to our advantage. The third receiver strong is a hot receiver. We know that the center is blocking weak and that the split back is check-releasing weak. We know that the quarterback is reading the fourth rusher strong as his hot read. Our blitz is coming from the fourth strong attitude. The lesser corner can take away the inside. He knows that all he has to play is a 6-yard stem. The ball is coming off; otherwise the quarterback is on his back. The defense has a free rusher.

We know whether you have the potential to block eight. When you do that, we bring nine. We have to have a free blitz man coming so that the corner is guaranteed heat and only has to cover the short route. We get there in a hurry, or we get beat in a hurry. We don't have to die that slow death with the quarterback standing back there baking a pizza.

When I was in high school, we double-called our coverage. We played one or the other, depending on the set. Ten of the players got the check, and one didn't. All he listened to was what was called in the huddle. He played the first call and not the second. What we do is this: All 11 break the huddle, and none of them know what is going on. Here is the huddle call: "AFDC, ready, break." They have to listen to the communications that are going on as the offense comes out to set up. They have to hear the Mike linebacker and free safety, and they all have to be on the same page. Otherwise, we are going to have a really crappy down. The thought process isn't that far out of whack. We put the best front-up that we can when you are going to run the ball and the best coverage when you throw it.

Tuesday is the off day for our players. That is in the collective bargaining agreement. That is when we put together the game plan. That is when we put together the formations, tendencies, runs, and passes.

On Wednesday we work on first- and second-down calls. On Thursday we repeat the hard first- and second-down calls and work really hard on the third-down calls. On Friday we throw all the crap at them, which includes goal line, short yardage, and that kind of stuff. On Saturday we review, and we play on Sunday.

In the drill part of linebacker play, we use these types of drills. We talk about defeating a block. We talk about defending-area responsibility against a run. We drill them in gap control. We give them a pass coverage key, zone or man to man. The last thing we talk about is pursuit.

Two things before I start the film. I always felt that if I could take one thing home from each guy who spoke, I had had a hell of a clinic. I learned a lot of things, even if it was just a different way to say the things I was doing. If it makes the kid understand because the new way is more descriptive, that is worth it. Here is the first thing Jack Pardee taught me. A linebacker is an in-between player. He has to be tough enough to play the run and have enough finesse to play the pass. The in-between player has to be coached this way. He lines up to stop the run and reacts to the pass, or he plays pass coverage keys and reacts to the run, but he is not going to do both. You are doing that linebacker an injustice if you are not coaching him that way.

 





Page 247

Your defensive call on first down is a run call. We are in an eight-man front, playing run as a linebacker and reacting to our pass coverage. That gives the linebacker a jump on making a big play. I want a play maker, not a robot. If I have to coach that linebacker very much, he is probably not a linebacker. The game is easy. Find the guy with the ball, and go splatter that sucker. Go intercept the ball when it is thrown. If he has instincts, don't screw them up. Don't give him so many things to think about that he can't play. Give him a run key, and let him run to the ball. If the offense gives him a "high hat" (that is pass blocking to us), he reacts and goes to pass coverage. The same thing is true of the pass key. The linebacker gets his pass key and gets into his coverage. If for some reason he were to get a run key, he reacts to the run.

The second thing is pad level. How many of us have said this over and over? "The guy with the lowest pads is going to win." You win with pad level. You have to get your pads underneath his pads. As the player gets down in his stance, he is thinking about whether his pad level is under his opponent's. The next thing he knows, he is on his back. Kids don't make a mistake on purpose. They make a mistake because they don't know what to do. They are trying to do what you tell them to do, but they don't know how. So you turn the film on. If you are not using a film every day in practice, you are stupid. The reason you watch the film is to see the body position. His line of sight is down, and he thinks his pads might be under the opponent's. Give him a horizontal look. Now, you ask him, "Are your eyes at his throat?" If the linebacker's eyes are not at the blocker's throat, he is too high. He can look straight ahead.

I talked about exploding their eyes on contact. Watch their eyes as they tackle. Do they explode the eyes through the contact, or do they cringe on contact and blink? Get to a point where you can see their eyes. If the linebacker can always see the throat, he is going to win at pad level.

We play a lot of eight-man front and get a lot of zone scoop blocking. We never allow both parts of the scoop. We are going to hold the man on the line of scrimmage and allow the linebacker to run downhill into the gap. If the blocker gives an avoid step and tries to play wide on the scoop to get to the linebacker, we use the momentum for the blocker to pull us away from the backside scoop block. We grab the hip of the first blocker and pull through to beat the back scoop block. They may get the down lineman blocked or the linebacker blocked, but they are never going to get both halves of the scoop blocked.

If people do a good job of getting the front seven blocked, the last guy they are going to block is the trail defender on the back side. If they leave him unblocked, we'll chase you down from there. We plug the hell out of the plays on the front side and make you cut back. When you do, that backside defender will knock the hell out of you and might cause a fumble. In our league, they use these pencil-necked wide receivers to block the back side. We never hold force on a wide receiver. When they come across in motion, they bring a corner with them in our scheme. The corner replaces the linebacker in force, so he can wrong-arm the wide receiver, get inside, and come laterally down the line of scrimmage.

Let's talk really quickly about pass rush. Study the great speed rushers. Who do you think told me all this stuff? Nobody told me this. I study films. You better get the film of the best team in your league and find out why they are kicking your butt. They probably know something you don't know. I get films of guys who are great speed rushers off the edge and watch them. He can fight centrifugal force. He is able to dip and rip and shorten the distance to the pocket. They have the ability to fight the pressure inside. They have the ability at the hip joint to plant and get the toe pointed to where they are going. If the toe is pointed outside and I get blocked outside, that is where I am going. It doesn't matter whether I am bigger and stronger. To fight the pressure, I have to get my cleats in the ground, get under his pads, and be able to run the line I want to. He has to fight with pressure to get his toe pointed and his hips turned in. With each step of my front foot, I have to get more cleats in the ground. We buy three eight-foot sections of PVC pipe and connect them in circles. We practice rushing

 





Page 248

around them. We make them chase one another in the warm-up drills. We use these circles and incorporate them into our sack-and-strip drill.

We have dummies with Velcro arms on them. We normally put a ball in them. As the linebackers are speed-rushing, they take the inside, upfield shoulder and wrap up the tackle. The downfield arm is stripping the ball. If they get the ball stripped out, they are scooping and scoring with the ball. If. the numbers of our players to theirs are even, we want to scoop and score. If the numbers are in their favor, get on the ball and recover it. We are working on a half-moon speed rush: knocking the ball out, scooping, and scoring. We try to pick the ball up and get it in the center of our body. We don't want them to try to pick the ball up outside the frame of the body. They straddle the ball when they pick it up. Then we have a race to the end zone. Make sure you spike it at the end. That is simple stuff, but they have to work on it too.

To teach the linebacker how to play over a tight end, I put him in a fit position. I put him in a position where his hands are on the inside and the tight end's hands are outside. I start with their arms collapsed. That is to simulate the tight end firing off and engulfing the linebacker. The linebacker's eyes are at the tight end's throat. His hands are inside, and his thumbs are up. He wants his feet in a good power base. From this point right here, I have to teach them to separate and shed. We call the drill "fit, separate, and shed." From this point, I work on extending his arms, getting his hips back, and getting his head to the outside. If the tight end starts to walk on the linebacker, the linebacker keeps a firm arm in the direction he is going. He takes three steps with the tight end and violently sheds him. From there, he gets in position to tackle.

The next thing we do is to put the tight end's hands down and let him come off. The linebacker has to fight for the inside hand position, get his hips and body away, and power-clean the tight end. Then he repeats the first drill.

I have added to the drill because we got a new tight-end coach who is working as hard as I am with his tight ends. I had to develop another part to this drill to work on beating the tight end's hands. I put two guys on a line. They are going for a three-second count. One guy starts with his hands inside. When I say go, the other guy tries to get his hands inside. They are pushing against each other and regaining inside control. We work on base, short steps, and control. If one guy loses his base, the other tries to throw him off the line.

We work on shedding a guy down. If a tight end is walking on us and has good body lean, we have trouble shedding him with the rip or throwing him to the side. The only way to get off a tight end who has stood up the linebacker and is walking on him is to give ground and shed him down. We also incorporate that in the fit-and-shed drill.

When we talk about pass rush, it takes a lot of off-season work. We work with a karate expert. It helps keep the hands of the offensive linemen off us. If a guy is trying to get his hands on the linebacker, we want the linebacker to strike and clean the offense's hands, elbow to wrist. Long-armed tackles are what we face. We make the contact on them elbow to wrist. You have to learn how to practice against each other. We don't want to hurt our guys. We try not to have any bull rushes. We put them 3 yards away from each other as a running back on a linebacker. We work edges and finish with rips and swims.

If we reach the level of the quarterback, we want to be a contain rusher. At the same time, if we can beat the guy inside to the quarterback, we do. The first time we blitz, I want the linebacker to bull-rush over the back.

"Time is up!"

Fellows, this always happens to me, whether it is Coach Fisher cutting my individual period or the moderator telling me to stop. It's been great being here.

The Trap and Trap-Option Package

University of Nebraska

It is my pleasure to share with you our trapping game and the option off those traps. Last Wednesday, when I left Nebraska, it was snowing. Coming over, I kept thinking how good my nine iron was going to be. It is a great experience coming to Hawaii. The coaches here understand football and make a great effort to learn.

I know that some of you do not run the option. I am sure that most of you run some type of trap. If you don't do it, you can at least learn what we are doing at Nebraska, and hopefully that will help you. We have had a lot of success in the last four years. We won the national championship in 1995. For those last four years, we have a 47-2 record.

I would like to comment on the job Earl Browning has done getting this clinic started. Also, Tom Cheaney and Ed Roach have helped put the Hawaii clinic together. Rick Sakata has done a lot of work behind the scenes. I know it takes a lot to get these programs started. Getting everything organized takes a lot of effort. I want them to know we appreciate the effort.

I want to go over three of our traps and two of the options that come off the traps. The first trap is the one we run off tackle. We trap the first offensive defender outside of our offensive tackle. The fullback aims at the butt of the offensive tackle and reads the tight end. The fullback gets the ball, although we do run the play from a one-back set. We give it to our I back and run the same blocking scheme. Against the 50 front, we are going to have our onside tackle step with his right foot and chip the defensive tackle. Then he comes off on the linebacker plugging, back to the noseguard running, to the backside linebacker. We have the tight end come down and aim high because he is getting help with his offensive tackle. Then the end works upfield.

Against the 50 front, the onside guard is going to pull. He is really going to climb the hole. He is going to try to get the rush end kicked out. What happens is this. As the tight end squeezes down, the defensive end closes down with the end. We really have to climb the hole to get it kicked out. If we face the even front, we pull our guard a little flatter. If it is an odd front, we really climb the end to get him kicked out.

Again, the fullback is going to come off the butt of the tight end who is off his down block. The quarterback will reverse out with a three-quarters turn. We are going to run option action with the tailback and quarterback. We hope to get underneath the onside linebacker if we run the option play enough. Hopefully, he will widen, looking for the option. We set the play up by running the option play a number of times. On the 50 front, we have to fool the frontside linebacker and get underneath him. On the back side, we pull our guard around and try to get our center to cut off to the back side.

If the frontside tackle has a defender on his inside, we have him communicate this to the tight end. The tackle will down-block, and the tight end will block the tackle. We will have the wide receiver go in motion and block down on the first linebacker. He has a double read. He can block on the first linebacker to show or the strong safety coming up.

TRAP VS. 50 FRONT

Against the even look, say, a 6-2 or 4-4 front, we come down with our tackle. He steps down with his lead foot

toward the man inside. The big trouble we have with our tackle is getting in too wide a stance. When he takes the lead step, he has to bring his back foot underneath him to get balance. It is just enough time to give the defense a chance to react. We want to shorten up the stance and step directly at the defender. We will get some help from the center in case the man slants back inside. The tackle can aim a little higher because he knows he has help coming from his center. The onside guard pulls and traps the first thing outside of our tackle. If we have an eagle look, we are going to trap the 7 technique lined up on our tight end. On the option, if we get a 7 technique on our end, we will have the end block him. When we run the trap, we are going to trap him with our guard.

TRAP VS. SPLIT 6 (4-4)

I know that it looks like an easy block with the tackle on the inside man, but that man can do a lot of things that make it difficult to block him. That is why we have our center help the tackle.

If the tight end has a 9 technique, he will release underneath. If he has a 7 technique on him, he goes to the outside. When the tight end has to go outside, the pulling guard hugs the line a little closer. He breaks off the block of the tight end. Again, at times the play will break, and we do not even have to touch the linebacker because he is running outside to play the option.

Against the 4-3 front, the play is very similar to the 44 front. We pin block with the tackle. We pull the center to help on the down defender. The onside guard kicks out on the end.

TRAP VS. 4-3 FRONT

If we want to bring the flanker back in motion and have him crack back on the linebacker, the tight end comes down inside. The flanker is also involved in the passing game and runs several routes from this motion.

TRAP WITH MOTION VS. 4-3 FRONT

That is how we would run our fullback trap off tackle. What happens at times on the play, especially on the 4-3 front, is that the defensive end will slant down inside, with our tight end releasing inside. What we do then is to have the tight end jump the end on his slant. Then we just bring the guard around for the first linebacker. If the defensive end lines up inside our tight end, we will release around him. We do not have our end block him on the trap if he lines up inside.

TRAP VS. 50 SLANT

 





Page 251

We have run the same play with the I back when we were in a one-back set. There is nothing unique about having the fullback. If we see a 4-3 front, we can run it just with the I back. We like it with the fullback. We have the blocking scheme set so that we can run it with either back.

I-BACK SETTRAP

If we are seeing a steady dose of the 4-3 with the end on the 9-technique end playing on the outside of our tight end, we will change up the blocking between the tight end and pulling guard.

The tight end will base-block the run end, and the pulling guard will block the outside linebacker. We will use this change-up against teams that like to play their rushes wide. The center is assigned the middle linebacker. He will not help the offensive tackle on his pin block.

CHANGE-UP TO OUTSIDE TRAP

If we call the play and the defense does not give us the 4-3 look, we will change back to our inside zone blocking scheme. This is nothing new for us. It is the same blocking scheme that we use to block a lot of plays. This is how we would adjust our blocking if they came up with a 50 front.

32 ROLL VS. 50 FRONT

Next is our option. Our option off the trap is one of the best options, year in and year out. Our belly option starts out very similar to the trap. The main difference is we block a 7 technique with our tight end and pull the guard around for the linebacker. We will trap to the 7 technique with our guard. When we run the option, we release our tight end inside and hope the rush end squeezes down inside. If he does, we log-cut the rush with our guard. If we get the big cut by our guard, the fullback bounces outside and blocks the play-side linebacker. We always option the force man on this play. If the rush end comes upfield, we kick the end out, and the fullback comes underneath the kickout block and looks for the onside linebacker. We tell our guard to pull flat on an even front and to climb the hole against an odd front.

Against a 4-4 front, our tackle will pin-block, and the center will protect against a slant, then go up for the backside linebacker. If the tight end has a 7 technique on him, he will block the 7 technique, and the guard will pull around for the linebacker. Since the guard is now blocking the frontside linebacker, our fullback is free to go block the safety.

OPTION VS. 7-TECHNIQUE RUSH

 





Page 252

Against a 50 front, the frontside tackle will chip the man on him by stepping with the right foot (option right) and proceed upfield, checking for a frontside plug by the onside linebacker, then proceed to the backside linebacker. The pulling guard will climb the hole and hope to get a log cut on the end man. The tight end blocks down on the man on our tackle. If we can get a log cut on the defensive end, the fullback bounces outside and blocks the onside linebacker. We option the force.

OPTION VS. 50 FRONT

If the rush end comes upfield, we will kick the end out, our fullback will come underneath the kick block, and the quarterback will duck up underneath as well.

50 FRONT-RUSH END UPFIELD

Against a 4-3 front, our tackle will pin-block. Again, we will either kick the rush end out or log-cut him. The fullback and quarterback will again read the guard's block to determine whether to go inside or underneath.

9-TECHNIQUE RUSH

If the rush end slants inside, our tight end jumps the slant and blocks the rush. Our guard will now block the man who the tight end was to have blocked. Our fullback will still bounce outside and block the playside linebacker.

DEFENSIVE-END SLANT

This play is our best option on the guard log. In our power set, we will assign our wingback to second deep. Against the 6-2 guard log, we will have our center scramble the 1 technique on the guard. We use the same technique on the defensive tackle as we did against the 5 technique on a 50 front. The fullback and quarterback will read this block on the defensive end and either go around or come up underneath if we have to kick the end out.

VS. 6-2 FRONT, GOAL LINE

 





Page 253

A lot of teams in college football try to run this play but have problems with it. The reason we have had success with the play is because we spend a lot of time on the play. Most teams are not willing to spend the time to perfect the play.

Against the split 6 or 4-4 front, if we get a defender in the 7-technique position, our tight end will block him. That allows our guard to pull around and block the frontside linebacker. Our wingback will block the second deep man. We count the outside linebacker as the first deep, so our wingback will block the corner here. Since the guard will block the linebacker, our fullback is free to block the safety.

VS. SPLIT 6 OR 4-4, GOAL LINE

We will run the flanker in motion to block the frontside linebacker. Now the fullback will go to the safety.

VS. 4-3 WITH FLANKER MOTION

Another thing we have done is run the option to a non-tight-end side if we get the right defensive look. Some teams will move the Sam linebacker out wide and play roll-up coverage with the secondary. We see this often.

OPTION TO NON-TIGHT-END SIDE

The offensive tackle will chip the rush end if the guard is uncovered. The tackle will chip the rush then block the middle linebacker. The guard pulls and either log-cuts the rush man or kicks the rush man outside. The fullback has the frontside linebacker. If the guard is covered, the tackle has to pin-block the man on our guard. The guard will still pull and block the end man.

When we get into two tight ends, we will give the play to the quarterback. He has the option to call ''either/ or'' at the line to the side where he wants to run the play. We prefer to run the play to an eagle-look side rather than the 50-front side. Sometimes the rush will be a 7 technique. The tight end will then block the 7 technique, putting our guard on the onside linebacker and allowing the fullback to go to the safety. A common blitz we see by the corner and rush is for the corner to loop underneath while the rush goes to the pitch. We teach our pulling guard to read this and go block the corner. The quarterback will option the rush, and the fullback and quarterback will bounce outside the guard's block on the corner.

EITHER/OR VS. EAGLE

 





Page 254

We prefer to run our trap up the middle into an even front. We will usually "either/or" the play so that we can trap the widest 2 technique. We never send in the play to go one way or the other. We always "either/ or" the play. The center will block back to the tightest 2 technique. If they are even, it doesn't matter. The quarterback has the option to go to either side. The quarterback is schooled to pin the tightest 2 technique. We are always pinning our center back on the tightest 2 technique. If you do not do that, the center will have to block the 3 technique, and that is a hard block. That 3 technique can screw up the play because he can get up the field in that position, so the first thing the quarterback has to do is to decide which way he wants to run the play. He can go one way or the other with it.

Our trapping guard is taught to take a drop step, then climb the hole on his second step. His first step is to lose ground and gain a little distance. The second step is right back up into the hole. We do not want him going flat down the line and aiming for one particular man. He is aiming for an area. Our best traps come when the defense loops the tackle outside and plugs the linebacker. Oftentimes we will end up trapping a plugging linebacker.

The tackle on the side that we are going to trap will block the first linebacker on his inside seam. If no one is there, he finds the first linebacker inside. We tell our tackle to aim flat and anticipate the linebacker stepping up. We tell our fullback to aim at the cheek of the center opposite the hole. The quarterback will reverse around and give the fullback the ball as he turns. The guard on the side that the trap will take place will either (1) quick-draw or (2) head-bob, or arm over the man on him, and go to the first linebacker inside.

VS. 4-4

Against a 4-3 front, when we are trapping a 2 technique, we may use a quick draw by our guard not involved in the trapping. Our tackle on the side that we are trapping will be assigned the middle linebacker. Our other tackle will reach the linebacker on his side; if he is heads up to the inside, he will block that linebacker.

VS. 4-3

When we trap against an odd front, we pull our guard and come up on the linebacker. Our tackle on the trap side will reach-block the man on him. Our backside tackle blocks the linebacker on his side. Our non-trapping guard will help the center with the noseguard. Then he runs a "do-dad" block for the backside linebacker.

DO-DAD

If the noseguard is offset, the center will handle the offset by himself. The non-trapping guard will release directly to the backside linebacker.

VS. OFFSET NOSEGUARD

 





Page 255

If we get caught running a trap against the doubleeagle front, we have to block back with our center and guard and trap with the other guard. We do not like to run the play against this defense, but if we do have to run it, this is how we do it. If they shift into the defense and we get caught, we have to run the play.

VS. DOUBLE-EAGLE FRONT

When we run our trap, it is primarily a fullback play, but we do not always run it as a fullback play. We will run it as a one-back play. Say we are in the spread formation or shotgun formation. We can run it from the I back, the no-backs set, or motion no-backs.

SPREAD OR SHOTGUN FORMATION

MOTION-QUARTERBACK NO-BACKS SET

I BACK IN A ONE-BACK SET

Next, I want to talk about our trap option. We run our trap option differently than most people. We have tried to incorporate our trap option into our outside zone package. Our outside zone package is this. If I am a tackle and I am covered and the guard is uncovered, I want to cross over and escape to the linebacker. The uncovered linemen will pull down and overtake. That is our basic scheme. If you are covered, you are going to stretch, cross over, and go upfield to the linebacker. If you are uncovered, you are going to pull and overtake. We try to incorporate our trap option with some outside zone concepts.

Our play starts out looking like a trap play. We option the end man on the line of scrimmage. This option generally gets the ball in the I back's hands. That is what we want because they are the best runners we have. Our quarterbacks are the next best runners. When we go to the open side, our option will get the ball in the quarterback's hands. However, this is the option to the tight-end side, where we are going to get the ball to the I back most of the time. Our tight end will try to get the outside linebacker on his side. The trap action will hold the linebackers, so the tight end has a good chance of getting the outside linebacker.

If we are running the option play to our right, the left tackle and left guard have to base the men on them. Oftentimes the left guard is uncovered, so he can work with the center. If the center is getting help from our left guard, then the center will rip-reach and escape, and the left guard will pull or overtake. The right guard knows that if the center is not working with him, he has to rip-reach on the man on him. If the defender is a wide 3 technique, the guard will usually cut the man on him. The right tackle will check for the outside linebacker plugging and then go to the middle linebacker. The tight end has the outside linebacker.

Against a 4-4 front, we see the linebacker more on the line. The backside guard and tackle base up. The fullback comes off the fake and tries to find the backside linebacker. The quarterback shows trap action and comes outside.

 





Page 256

TRAP OPTION VS. 4-4

Now, we are going to option the end man on the line. We are going to pull and escape with the guard on the linebacker. We pull and overtake the center. Between the guard and tackle on the play side, we should get the linebacker blocked. If the guard cannot get the linebacker on the play side, he should go to the backside linebacker.

The thing we like about this play is this. The action of the backs holds the linebackers in place. We can get the play walled off. We will option against the linebacker if he is on the line of scrimmage. If he is walked off, the tight end will go block him. That is the way we attack the 4-4 with the linebacker off the line.

The last trap I want to talk about is our tackle trap. The play looks like the inside zone to one side. There is a definite cutback. We look at where the defense lines up on our guard in the area where we are going to trap. If they line up in a 3 technique, the pulling tackle will go up inside on a linebacker. If he lines up heads up to the inside, we will trap on the line of scrimmage. Let me show you three situations so you can see how it works. We have tackles that are mobile and can run this play.

First, I will show you the play against the eagle look. The tackle on the split side is in a 3 technique. This means that we are going to trap the linebacker with our offside tackle. The nose is generally offset. The center takes the offset nose by himself. The play starts out looking like an inside zone play to the tight-end side. The strong-side guard steps outside, checks for the tackle slanting down inside, and then takes on the linebacker. 

TACKLE TRAP VS. EAGLE FRONT

The quarterback brings the ball straight back to the tailback, as deep as he can get it to him, and lets the tailback read the play. The tailback aims at the strongside guard and cuts it back behind the tackle's trap block. The fullback fills off the tackles. The tailback starts off to the strong side and cuts back behind the tackle's block. The split-side guard and tackle take the 3 and 5 techniques. They show a quick-pass setup, then come off and block those two linemen.

TACKLE TRAP VS. 4-4 FRONT

Here we have a noseguard who is offset. The man is on the center. Again, the pulling tackle is going to block the linebacker. Since our tackle is uncovered, the fullback will block the end, and our end will block the linebacker.

TACKLE TRAP VS. OFFSET NOSE

 





Page 257

VS. 4-3 WITH TWO 2 TECHNIQUES

We do run the tackle trap to the tight end some of the time. Primarily, we run it to an open side. We still use the same rules. If the man is not on the line, the guard will trap the linebacker. Here it is against the 50 front to the tight-end side.

TRAP OPTION TO TIGHT END VS. 50 FRONT

What I would like to do here now is to show you the video of the plays I just covered. I appreciate your attendance. I will be around the rest of the evening, and I will be glad to visit with you and talk about our program. Thank you.
