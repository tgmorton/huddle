three things. [Demo: lock out and separate, lock out and rip, and lock out and beat the reach block]

I start the defensive end in a good football position. His hands should be on the outside to start out. We always talk about hand and eye placement. We want the hands inside on the breast plate. His palm is up, and we are in the V of the neck. If we have inside gap, we only work on one thing. We pull with the inside arm and lock out with the outside arm. We just turn the shoulders.

After that, we need to go upfield with the man. We pull on the outside and lock out. As we do that, we are putting a step into the move. It is a quick step. We are trying to get the players to understand leverage on the blocking. After doing some research, I found out that our kids need to know and understand pressure points and leverage to play good football. [Demo]

The next phase of the drill is lock out and rip. We do the same as before, but now we rip and come upfield three yards. We want to keep the shoulders square. We run the drill so each player gets one or two shots on it.

The next drill is against the reach block. Now we want him to lock and reach. He is in a good football position, and he is inside. The offensive man has already reached the defensive man. The football is going to the outside. Now we want to pull the man back inside. We want to use his weight and leverage. We want to throw him back inside and get off the block. If you are playing the 5 technique, you do not know where the offensive man is going. You must react to what he is doing.

5 TECHNIQUE VS. REACH BLOCK

Let me go back to the basic drive block again. As the offensive man comes at our end, he is in a three-point stance. My inside foot is going to be on his outside foot. I have to step up on him. We hit him in the V of the neck, keep the hands inside, and drive him back upfield. If you get movement and knock him back upfield, then the offense does not have a chance. You are forcing the ball inside. We do not want them going inside too quickly. We know that tailback can squirt back outside. We know all linebackers are going to scrape to the ball.

On the toss sweep, the 5-technique end must make his first step upfield. He has to know how to react against that blocker. That blocker is trying to get to his outside number. We want to string the play out wide. We do not want the ball going north and south. We have the safety who is going to fill inside. Also, we have a Will linebacker who is going to fill. We want our end to get outside and make the play.

The next block we are going to see against our 5 technique is the down block. This is the block we see on the inside zone play. I want the end to step upfield with that first step. He sets his feet with the second step. This gets him going. He wants to keep his shoulders square. The offensive tackle blocks down inside. I tell our ends to choke down and to find out what is going on. I want him to drag that back leg two steps. If the ball is inside, the end reads the mesh point for that quarterback. His eyes should be on that quarterback. The quarterback is going to give the ball to the fullback, or he is going to keep the ball on the bootleg, or it is going to be a reverse play. Most teams like to run the zone play and cut back into the C gap. We want to take that away from the man with the ball. As the blocker steps down, we want to step up. We want to punch the tackle inside. Now we are going to drag our feet and keep our shoulders square to the line of scrimmage. They can see everything from this position. I tell them to train their eyes to keep the shoulders square. The first thing he should expect is the fullback on the inside zone play.
