Defensive Line Techniques

Ohio State University

It is a privilege for me to be here. I want to talk to you people about defensive line play. I have had a chance to work in some great programs for some great coaches. I had a chance to work with Dennis Stoltz at Bowling Green, Don James at the University of Washington, and John Cooper at Ohio State. I've been at Ohio State only one year, but it is a great learning experience working with a coach like John Cooper. The defensive coordinator is Fred Pagac. He has helped me a lot, and I have learned a lot of football from Fred.

Fred is a little different. Anyone who has followed Ohio State knows they have been pretty much a read-type defense. They have been a "bend but don't break" type of defense over the years. When Fred took over this last year, he kind of rolled the dice a little. He is a get-after-them type of guy. If you make a mistake, you make a mistake.

Let me start by telling you that we had some great football players. I think everyone in this room probably knows that. We had an outstanding defensive football team this year at Ohio State. I was fortunate to walk into that situation. We had four guys up front, and three of them will probably be drafted. One of them will be a first-round pick. We had three linebackers that were outstanding. Two were seniors who had started for three years. The middle linebacker was a freshman and probably as good as any linebacker I've ever seen. Our corners were outstanding, and we had a couple of safeties that could get it done. We had a great football team and could do a lot of things.

As we went through the year, our philosophy changed a little. We started out the year as a slide defense with a reduction toward the tight-end side. Throughout the year we changed up and played a lot of "Ohio defense." The Ohio defense is a Bear defense where we are flatout after you. We also played a lot of weak reduction, which we didn't think we were going to play at all. Things happened during the year that really helped us out. We found out that we had two corners who could play man to man. We had a great corner who was probably as good as anybody in the country. The guy on the other side was just about as good. When we found out that we had corners who could cover people, it made our life easier. We became a blitzing, attacking football team. We also had a free safety who developed the nickname of "Wacko." He was a blitz guy. I've found out over the years that if you find a guy who likes to blitz, send him. Every time we sent this guy, he made something happen.

I'm going to talk about defensive line play. I'm kind of the brunt of everyone's jokes at Ohio State. They say that all I have to do is take care of A and B gaps and they'll do everything else. There are four areas I'm going to hit on really quickly.

I think the front four is the most critical part of any defensive unit. There are two things they have to do. They have to control the run and get pressure on the quarterback. I've been in this situation before. If you have to blitz to get pressure or stop the run, you will get burnt eventually. This year we had a front four that could get pressure. When we brought linebackers or the free safety, they created havoc in the backfield.

I think the next point is the most important thing. This is the thing I say most to the defensive line: Beat the blocker. That is the name of the game. The first thing a young defensive lineman wants to do is make a play. As coaches, we have to make them understand that if they want to make a play, they have to beat the blocker. That is the first thing I tell them. Someone is going to block you. Then I go through the offensive play book. I show them in that book that they are not going to leave any linemen unblocked. That is where I start the progression.
