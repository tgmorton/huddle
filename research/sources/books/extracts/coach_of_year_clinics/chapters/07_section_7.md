Our first goal is to 
win our state championship. 
We are the only team that plays both the other teams. Miami and Florida don't play each other. If we can beat both of those teams, we have an opportunity to go for the National Championship most of the time. We were fortunate to beat both teams in the regular season this year. We have been in the ACC for five years. Our second goal is to 
win the ACC Championship. 
That is important because the winner of the ACC Championship automatically gets a New Year's Day Bowl Game. How you are ranked at the end of the year determines what type of bowl game you get. We have lost one conference game in five years. Our third goal s to 
win a New Year's Day Bowl. 
If you can play in and win a New Year's Day Bowl Game, you will end up in the top four or five in the country. We have finished in the top four for 10 years in a row.

Not every player we get is a good football player. But they have been winning for us. I had Deion Sanders there. He was not a great player. I am not saying that to get any credit for his success. Deion earned what he got. He is not the most-talented guy around; he is the hardest-working guy around. That is saying a lot, because we have had some great players over the years. Hard work is the key to success. I remember that back when I was at Alabama, I was not a great player. was one of the guys who was average that Coach Bryant took and made think he was a great player. Coach Bryant had that knack. I thought I was great, and because of that I played better than I should have. That is one of the things we try to do at FSU. If you can reach the guy who is an average player and make him raise his play to another level, you can be successful.

One of the best high school teams I've seen in the state of Georgia did not have a single guy taken off that team. Valdosta has been one of the most successful programs in the country. They must have won 20 State Championships. I was recruiting and asked the coach how he kept coming up with good teams. He told me hat he coached next year's team this year. I went back and thought a lot about that. That is the thing we do on defense. We play ever single guy we can get ready o play in a game. We try not to play a guy who is not eady. But if a guy can contribute, we try to get him in the game. If we can get him in the game, he is going to prepare better. If he prepares better, we are going to perform better. If he can make a play, he will push the guy playing ahead of him.

Our last goal is to 
win a National Championship. 
We have done that one time in 13 years. Coach Bowden has had two undefeated seasons and has lost in the bowl game for the National Championship. You are not going to win every time you get there. But if your guys keep fighting and getting in that situation, sometime it will fall your way. It has happened to us one time. The way our kids have worked in the off-season program, we will be back. It may not be next year, but we will be back. We'll play for it again, and if we don't screw them up, we'll win it.

We tell our kids that if they want to win the National Championship, they have to be 
dependable. 
They have to do what the coaches tell them. If they are supposed to play in the A gap, they better play it. There are no excuses for them not doing it. This applies to the offseason also. We can't make our guys go to the weight room or come to the off-season program. We don't try to. All we do when they miss is give them the opportunity to make up for what they missed, because we think their mama would want them to do that, and we don't want to let mama down. We want them to be on time and do their job the very best they can on every play. Bobby Knight made the final statement on this when he said you have to do it time after time after time. That is called 
consistency. 
You can't be great without consistency. You have to be 
productive. 
It doesn't matter whether you are on the field, in the weight room, in class, or in study hall. Jimmy Johnson probably gets as much out of this as any coach in the business. If they don't produce for him, they are someone else's problem. We can't do that. We have to find another way to motivate these guys. That is when coaching becomes difficult and the biggest challenge.

I've got a kid who started at strong safety for me this past year. He was a walk-on who started playing a little last year but broke his arm in the fifth game. He couldn't do any upper-body work. He worked on his lower body in the off-season program. The doctors
