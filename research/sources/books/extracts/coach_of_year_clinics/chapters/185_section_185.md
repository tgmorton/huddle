You have to play smart, with poise and pride. They have to have confidence in themselves. There may be a guy with less ability who can play because he is confident that no one can beat him. Toughness is what wins the game. You have to think team, be committed, and be unselfish. Those are things that a lot of people don't have today.

You have to do whatever it takes to win. If you want to win, you have to work harder. People can say that they want to win. That is easy. They have to prepare to win through hard work. You can outhustle people, but execution wins.

This next point is a big one. Coach Paterno does this great. We meet every morning. We look at our personnel board. We move people up and down that board. Who should be moved up a number? Who should we move down? You have to get the proper people in the proper positions. We have moved guys from defense to offense. We had a kid who came to Penn State as a linebacker. Now he is a running back. If you get the proper people in the right positions, they make the plays.

You have to talk to your team. They have to understand your goals and what they are working for. We as coaches are going to work hard but smart. We are working to win. Some people work hard, but they don't work smart.

You have to punish people. You won't win games unless you punish people. You have to get your kids ready to punch somebody in the mouth. You have to get people on the run, and when you get them down, put them away. This is a physical game. We want to beat our opponent physically. How fast you get to the ball only matters if you punish people when you get there. You control gang tackling. It is not how fast you are; it is how physical you are. When the running back is getting pounded, he starts asking the coach to spread the ball around a little.

What are the qualities we look for in the defensive line? The number one thing is toughness. I never recommend a guy for our coaches to look at if he is not tough. When I say tough, I mean the tougher the challenge, the better he plays. We want a kid who is a competitor. You won't see size on our list. You can't worry about size. In the line, it is a street fight. You don't talk about weight classes in a street fight. It is the same way with the defensive line. You can't tell the guy that you can't fight him because he is out of your weight class. You can work harder than anybody else to get better. You can go to the weight room and work on your strength. You can work on your hand and foot quickness. The game of football is played with the hands. If you have a guy with quick hands and feet, he can play. We work with martial arts to increase the speed of the hands.

A defensive lineman has to be aware of what is going on around him. He has to shed blockers. He has to be able to change direction effectively. That is important in defensive football. The lineman must stay focused. He has to be able to get off a block. He has to be just downright mean.

In the defensive linemen's meeting room on the left-hand side of the bulletin board is "loyalty and trust." It never comes off the board. We trust each other, and we are very loyal. We never criticize our teammates or talk about them. If I can't trust a player, he is not going in the game. When all the guys are working together, they share that trust in one another. You can't talk out of both sides of your mouth. You have to talk straight.

We evaluate our players. We have a sheet that we use to evaluate them. The strength coach evaluates the players. The trainers and coaches evaluate them. Their academic advisors evaluate them also. We give them a 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 grade. We want to get the winners on the field. These guys control the tempo of the game. They are the ones who can make big plays and turn the game around. If you have a horse, make sure he gets in the race. Make sure the good back gets his hands on the ball. I'm not talking about some prima donna. I'm talking about guys with character who won't get you beat.

There are three types of guys. There are players who are winners, players who won't get you beat, and players who will get you beat. Forget about potential,
