the inside or to the outside. We do number the gaps as most of you do: A, B, and C gaps.

One of our best calls has been our Y call. This is a loop technique for the tackle. The end is going to come down inside, and the tackle is going to take the quarterback.

We have some techniques where we always step with the foot that is to the shade side and follow with a short jab step with the trail foot. This is a six-inch punch step. With our hands under his pads, we roll the hips, thumbs up, head up, and tail down. This would be our 531 call.

We want to step to the offensive man, play gap control, and stay square with the line of scrimmage. You may use a three- or four-point stance. A three-point stance allows more movement laterally. A fourpoint is good against short yardage or pass rush. A four-point stance is good against teams that like to double-team a lot.

For a pass rush, change stance to sprinter stance. You are faster off the ball in a sprinter stance. We use the rip, hook-under, fake-and-go, and pull-and-tear techniques.

Against the trap, we must not get trapped. Anytime you do not feel pressure, we step down. Don't penetrate upfield. Wrong-arm trap if you can; if not, make a pile. Try to turn all traps into a sweep play. We want to make the other team run east and west, never north and south.

At times we call our red call, which is our auto-

alignment. We could call "red 1." This means we are going to go with a 2 technique to the formation side. We are going to shade the tight end and tackle in a 2 technique. We stack the linebacker.

We feel that we can protect the formation side to the strong side of the formation. We want to protect the linebacker by moving the down linemen. We can play a red 1, 2, or 3.

We can use a 40 front against multiple sets. This is our base alignment on our 40 base front. We still run the 40 front, and we still use the same type of calls.

We can use our calls from our 50 front while we are in our 40 defense. The call would be a 413. The 40 sets the defense. The 13 sets the rest of the defense. The 1 s the technique for the line, and 3 is our secondary coverage.

Against two tight ends we will go to our 60 alignment. We
may change some of our personnel, particularly
