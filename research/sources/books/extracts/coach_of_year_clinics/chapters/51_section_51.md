One thing that irritates me is to have a player drop the pass and have a coach yell, ''Catch the ball." Why tell him that? 
Why 
did he drop the pass? Not every good athlete in your program has good hands to start out with. You have to work on their hands. Work on their depth perception. One of the first things you do is to take them to the optometrist. Many kids have poor eyes and have not had their vision checked. Work with them on depth perception. One thing you can do is to work with them on their hands. Work with them individually. A lot of kids lack confidence so much that they get nervous when they are in a group setting and drop a lot of passes. If you have a really good athlete who needs to work on his hands, then get him out on the field and work with him individually. Move the ball around, and make him catch the ball. Teach him to use his hands in relation to his eyes.

On the strong side against the trips look, very seldom do we get a team that will bring a linebacker outside and up close and play us with two deep. If they do, we are going to run the stretch play. If they stay in a conventional look, they will probably be in a threedeep look. This is a simple read.

We have more trouble throwing a slant route than we do the in route. If you just think about it, you will see that it makes sense. If you look at the man coming inside and squaring his body up as compared to a receiver coming in on the slant at a sharp angle, it is easier to throw the inroute. What are we looking for? The high-percentage completions! Teams that throw the ball had better be able to complete 60 percent of them. If you throw the ball a lot, you had better be able to complete 65 percent of the passes. There is not anyone in here, even if you have an average team, who cannot average 4 yards per snap.

The point here is this: If you have a strong-side cover three, you need to send the tight end down the middle. If they are playing cover two, we want the tight end to keep the safeties back deep. Also, we want to keep the linebacker inside where we can do something outside.

Let me talk about cover three. We always look at the defenders' shoulders. Their shoulders will basically tell you what they are going to do. The more they open the shoulders, or the more they close their shoulders, you know where they are going. Look to see what the shoulders are telling you. We are going to take a threestep drop, and we are going to read the strong safety and see what he does. If he hangs back, we have a good split between the two wide receivers. They are running 6 yards apart, and they are running the in route. We throw the ball to the outside receiver. If he opens toward the field, we have a good throwing lane between the strong safety and the inside linebacker, unless they happen to drop the defensive end. Usually when they are playing cover three, the end on the other side is dropping. There is always something they can do differently, I promise you.

This is a good route for you if you are a team that throws a lot of square-ins to your outside receiver down the field and you are having problems with your protection. You can throw this as a three-step drop. You could run this out of three wide receivers and two backs. The inside receiver runs a hitch, and the outside man runs the square-in.

I want to move on to another route that we have had a lot of success with. The reason we have had success is this: What happens when you go up against a threedeep team and you are running three wide receivers? We would like to get four vertical on them. If they are in a three-deep and we send four men vertical, we end up with a two-on-one at one point. If we are running all four on what we call nine routes, we will be sending our receivers all the way down the field. If the free safety cheats to the tight-end side, we hit the split end. If he cheats to the split-end side, we hit the tight end.
