into him, jam him, and be on top of him. That is the most important thing in bump coverage.

To keep the receiver from walking all over the defensive back, we use a punch at the line to force a release. Just as soon as the receiver moves, the defensive back punches him with the inside hand on the inside tip of the receiver. When that happens the receiver's coach is going to tell him to lean back.

The other thing you can do is to fake a punch. The receiver leans back, and that slows his release. If the defensive back reaches with the wrong hand in bump and run, he is dead. The most natural thing for the defensive back to do is throw both hands up and squat. Either one of those things kills you in bump and run.

We want to protect the middle of the field in bump and run. We give up the out route. Make them throw the ball in the flat, but don't let them throw the ball over your head outside. Those are the hardest passes to complete, so everything is relative to that.

If the receiver takes an inside break, the defensive back jams him the same way. That puts him inside the divide line. The defensive back assumes the low-shoulder position and rides him down the field. If the receiver cuts outside, he is cutting into the defender. If he breaks inside, the defender works down on him, always dragging his back hand so he can hook the receiver. That is the technique in a nutshell.

I could give you a list of drills to do to practice this. You can step and mirror the receiver on release using no hands. Step and slide on the release using no hands. You can do the same drills using the off hands. You have to teach kids to roll over quickly. Kids who play all their life in the off position have trouble turning. If they are turned left and they have to go right, they always slow-turn. When you play close coverage, if you slowturn, you're dead. When the receiver disappears behind the defensive back, the defender has to speed-turn into him. That is the drill we teach. The receiver runs down the field, making the defender roll-turn. Everything you do in close coverage is done with the speed turn.

Emerson Walls ran about 4.9 in the forty. He could not backpedal a step. He could not run a lick, but he always had his man cut off. He always used his help and had 39-inch arms to jam the hell out of people. He was a very effective player and never played in a backpedal. He could half-turn with the best of them, which meant he always had the receiver cut off.

Let's go to the strong safety on the tight end. The first thing we want to know is the alignment of the tight end inside or outside the divider. Most tight ends will be inside the divider. We play our strong safety like a rover back. He aligns 3 yards outside the tight end and 5 yards deep. If the tight end releases upfield, the strong safety runs to his outside shoulder and gets in a low position. He wants to get on the tight end as soon as he can. We never want to play a tight end or a big man in a high position, because he will push off the defender and come back for the ball.

The tight end releases to the outside, and the strong safety plays him on the divider. If the tight end runs into the seam, the strong safety should play even with him. If the safety plays low-shoulder, the quarterback can shoot the ball in there. If the safety plays highshoulder and the quarterback throws at the back pad, he's got the safety too. We run shoulder to shoulder in the seam. Ideally, we want to run the tight end out of the seam. When the tight end runs to the seam, the safety beats him there and makes him break one way or the other. When he breaks, the safety rolls into him and plays his technique.

Let's talk about the three linebackers and the strong safety playing the backs and the tight end. When you are playing middle-of-the-field coverage in man to man, you should never play in-and-out coverage with the tight end and near back. If the tight end runs up the field, the strong safety takes him. If the backs split and go different directions, the Sam linebacker takes the left back coming out, and the Will linebacker takes the right back coming out. The Mike linebacker backs up in the middle of the field to cut any player who comes in the middle of the field. If no one comes into the middle 5 to 7 yards deep, he continues to back up to help on the dig route.
