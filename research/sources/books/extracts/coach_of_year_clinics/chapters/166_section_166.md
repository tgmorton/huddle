Move it around. Now we go tall, fall, and run toe up. Watch their feet as they go by. They go from hitting the ground and taking a long time to push off to a quick push-off. Why? Because the muscle in stretch contracts faster with more force. Why do linebackers lean forward when the ball is snapped? Why does the tailback move his feet slightly when he starts his footwork on a play? If the muscle is in stretch, he can move faster. Why do baseball pitchers go through the windup? To stretch all of their muscles before they are balanced to deliver the ball to the plate. We have to put the calf in stretch. When they contact the ground, they push off.

The next drill is heel-up. This is good for our linemen. They tend to have a low-heel recovery. They run like a jogger instead of a sprinter.

The last drill is the tall tummy. Look at the sprinters coming down the track to the finish line. You could put a glass of milk on their heads, and they would not spill a drop. They are tall; they are rotating their arms and hips and pushing off with their feet. The clue is tall tummy. If the pro scouts measure them, they can get more money.

Men, I have a videotape to show you. Really quick, two more points. You have to take care of the people who took care of you. First, I want to thank Don Lessner and his staff for taking care of me. This has been a neat clinic. The people of Michigan have been very friendly. It has been fun. I know it will not be this way when we come back in the fall. I want to thank you for paying attention. I hope I have given you something that will help you.

AdvoCare is the company that sponsored me for this clinic. They have some really great products. If you are interested in their product, it is on the handout. It is a quality product, and I recommend it to you. Thank you for your attention.
