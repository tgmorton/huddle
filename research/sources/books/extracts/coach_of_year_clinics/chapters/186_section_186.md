and get them to execute. If you have an excuse player, don't play him. He always has an excuse for why he made a mistake. Don't play him. He'll get you beat.

I give our kids a checklist. Defense is our game, and winning is our aim. That is a catch phase for the defensive linemen. I give them a form. On the form are things that we are going to grade and work on all year long. I have the kids grade themselves. I grade them and write down comments for them.

I give them drills to do over the summer to improve on. It is a job description for them. Included on the sheet are the following: change of direction, stance, alignment, assignment, delivery of a blow, shed, pursuit, tackling, and a good base. We also include backpedal, opposite reaction, explosion, read keys, mental alertness, and second effort. I grade the players every night after practice and give them the sheet the next day.

Next are fundamentals. A player has to move and control his feet. He has to shed the high and low blocks. If a person can shed, he can make plays. Some guys can't get off a block. The tackles have to pass-rush, make tackles, pass-react, pursue, and be tough.

I'm going to talk about stance. We use a three-point stance in the defensive line. If I am teaching a young player a stance, I'll put him in a four-point stance. A four-point stance keeps the lineman down. You can't play with your shoulders turned. You want your pads square and your feet under you. A four-point stance helps the kid to do that. We get into a three-point stance, but 98 percent of our weight is on the ground. We have a slight stagger.

In our alignment we play head up, shade inside and outside, nose up, wide or loose alignment, and gap. We key the ball or anything that moves. If anything moves, we are going.

Our responsibility is whatever defensive technique we are in. I'll cover that later. The reaction is to what the defensive lineman sees. He has to see blocking schemes. He must understand his pass-rush lane. Let's go back to the mechanics of the stance. We don't use a wide base. That will get you in trouble. We want our feet under our hips. I don't say anything about shoulder width. Every kid thinks his shoulders are wider than they are. Good backs run with their feet under the hips. They don't get their feet outside the body. They are skaters. They work within the framework of their hips. When we start to get down, we put our hands on our knees. If I get in a right-handed stance, my right foot is back, and it is my push foot. If I get in a lefthanded stance, it is just the opposite. My knees are bent, and I have some weight on my hands: not too much, but just enough. The off hand is close to the ground. We get in the four-point stance and then pick up the other hand. We are a takeoff team. We read on the run. When the ball is snapped, we take off. In our bent-knee position, we get the power angles we want. We step and explode off the ball.

The first thing we tell our linemen is not to get knocked off the ball. If they get knocked off the ball and back into the linebacker, we can't move. If the lineman is in an outside shade on a guard, his inside hand is down. He steps with the inside foot. By stepping with the inside foot, the lineman can keep his outside leg free. If the stagger is too much, it cause the lineman to rise up. It also doesn't allow him to get into the blocker as quickly as having a shorter stagger. We want to get to the blocker quickly, make contact, punch with the opposite hand, and get off the block.

When the offensive blocker rises up to block, we don't rise up. We strike through him. We learn how to use both right- and left-handed stances. We have to play some techniques that require using the opposite hand down. Make your players line up straight. Your feet determine where the lineman lines up.

When we run drills, we film them. We watch the footwork of the linemen. If they don't step with the proper foot, they get a -3. That is discipline. We do it one way. I never stand behind the defense when we are practicing. I stand behind the offense. I want to see the defensive linemen's eyes. I want to see what they are seeing.
