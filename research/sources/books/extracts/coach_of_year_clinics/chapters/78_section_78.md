until it was the thing to do. Then the option faded away, and the trend of "pass, pass, pass" came into being. Now we see great corners who can cover one on one. The defense can bring unbelievable pressure on your quarterback. They try to knock the hell out of your quarterback every time he throws the ball. I have a feeling that the option is coming back into football. It was real good to us last year.

We run the inside zone, which is a power play to us. We double-team at the point of attack. One of the two will try to come off on a linebacker. We run our outside zone, and we run our option plays almost the same way as the outside zone plays. We run the lead draw. To me, it is perhaps our most successful play. It is right up the middle. I believe the reason that we are having success is because most teams have gone to a 4-3 defense. The lead draw has been really good. We attack the 3 technique and get a lead back up inside. If you have a good blocking fullback who can get on the linebacker, you turn people the way they want to go. The defense gets in the rush lanes and comes very hard. The lead draw has been good against that defense.

We will run the trap play. With everyone rushing so hard, we will run the trap as a "check with me" type play. We run the inside trap and the G trap. Both of these plays have been good to us. These are the type of plays that are coming back that were not very popular for a while. We have found that the zone plays and the trap plays are good package plays against the pressure defense or the eight-man front defense.

We do run some counter plays as well. We run some play-action passes, and we do run some three-, five-, and seven-step drop passing game. We have a lot of offense.

I want to take you through four passes that were really good for us this past year. When we run the zone to the outside, we have a hard time with the strong safety filling so fast. We run the play just as we would the zone play and fake the ball to the tailback. We run a 17-yard post route to our Z back. We call the play "pass 38 Z post." The 38 is for our running play. We add the Z post for the pass play. Everyone blocks down. If the strong safety bites and comes down, the quarterback reads him first. If the strong safety bites, we will take a shot at it and see if we can't hit the Z back on the post route. The Z back has to get a depth of 17 yards to keep the free safety from getting to the ball. If he runs a shorter route, the free safety can get it.

PASS 38Z POST

Now give the corner credit, and say he hangs back deep. Our fullback usually blocks the strong safety on the 38 play. Now he runs what we call a swing route down the sideline. We have seven-man protection up front. Now the tailback will help us with the strong safety blitz. The quarterback checks number one first. If the free safety bites, we will throw the post route. If the free safety hangs and the corner hangs, which they normally do, we will hit our fullback on the swing route to the flat. That swing route has been really good for us. We have made a lot of big plays off that one play.

We have made a lot of yardage out of a simple pass play we call our angle play. We simply dump the ball off to our back coming out of the backfield. We like to run the play in the middle of the field. Our protection is a six-man scheme. We run the play when we face a two-deep secondary. Most of the time we want to throw underneath. We like this play against dropping linebackers. BYU has made a living with this play. It is a five-step drop for the quarterback. As the quarterback reads the linebacker, he tries to dump the ball to the back swinging out of the backfield. The back releases to a point 3 yards outside the tight end,
