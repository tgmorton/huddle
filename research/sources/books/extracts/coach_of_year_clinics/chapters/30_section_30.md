(2) You play for and make breaks. When one comes your way, you have to score.

(3) If at first the game of breaks goes against you, don't slow down. Put on more steam.

(4) Stress the kicking game, because this is where the breaks are made.

(5) Protect your passer and kicker, and rush their passer and kicker.

(6) Be mentally alert at all times, and leave nothing to chance.

(7) Carry out your assignment.

(8) Intercept the football.

(9) Carry the fight to your opponents. Hit them hard and fast.

(10) Win the surest way.

When you talk about the running game at OSU, we have had some great talents. We had a great back in Robert Smith, who left early. Raymont Harris stepped in. After Raymont graduated, Eddie George stepped in. After Eddie came Peppy Pearson. After him will come someone else. That is the attitude we have.

Robert Smith gained 1100 yards as a true freshmen. After Robert left, Raymont stepped in and gained 1344 rushing in the first year he played for us. He plays for the Chicago Bears now. Then came Eddie George. The first year Eddie played for us he gained 1500 yards. His second year he gained 1900 yards and won the Heisman Trophy. After that came Pepe Pearson. His first year he gained 1484 yards rushing. That's not bad for a first-year guy. He will be a senior next year. Guys, mark it down. Pepe Pearson will probably lead the nation in rushing next year. That is what I'm telling him now. I'm telling him I expect him to be the best running back in the conference next year. I told him he gained more yards in his first year than Eddie George did.

Next year I expect him to gain 2000 yards. I'm telling him that right now, almost every day. He is working his butt off. He is 6' 0" and about 205 pounds. He runs a 4.3 forty. He is a tough kid and ain't going to get hurt. He can catch the ball coming out of the backfield. He will be All Big Ten and All American and might win the Heisman. He is going to be my running back, and I want him to believe that.

We talk about balance in our offense. Last year we rushed for 2700 yards and threw for 2500 yards. You better be able to run and pass in the Big Ten. When we line up against Penn State, if we can't throw the ball, we can't beat them. Michigan and Notre Dame are the same way. If we can line up and run the ball, we are going to pound on you all day. If you are smart enough to take our running game away, we better be able to throw the ball. You have to have balance in your offense.

In the winter conditioning program your team should get bigger and stronger. We want to build confidence and a physical attitude. We want to win games up front. At Ohio State we run the ball to set up the pass. When you play us, you better buckle your chin strap on tight. You have to get down in the trenches, because we are coming after you. If you stop us, we will do something else. If you have nine people committed to the line of scrimmage, we'll run a play-action pass at you and burn you for a big play.

We run the football to make our defense physical. How are you going to be a good defensive team if you don't face a good running football team? We face each other in the spring and, more important, in two days in the fall. One thing is important at all levels of football. On the high school, college, and pro level, you have to learn how to practice. We go against each other every day. But we don't get people hurt. We tell them the first day that they can't get hurt. We had 11 defensive football players who started 13 straight football games last season. They don't get hurt because they know how to practice. We are always in headgear. Most of the time we are in headgear and shoulder pads. Everything we do in practice, we always stay on our feet. We pound on each other every day, but we stay up. We tackle every day, but we don't put the ball carriers on the ground. That way we don't get hurt. Our players get hit in practice but don't get beat up.

We run our inside drill with our best offense against our best defense every day. During the season our pad
