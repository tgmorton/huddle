has a halfback offset in front of him and that is the man he keys. The Sam linebacker has no back in front of him, so he keys the offset back also.

If the set was a double wing the Sam and Will linebackers keyed the motion man. Anytime there was motion both of them keyed it. We only gave them two places to go. They got flow toward, and flow away from them. On flow toward, they scraped into their gap responsibility. If they got flow away, they got in their stack position inside behind the tackle or nose tackle, and waited for the counter coming back or the fullback on the midline trap.

This defense is our version of a stem front. We don't want to stem too much. We don't want to give them that kind of freedom. They seem to get tired quicker if they are moving all over the place and they are going to forget. When the ball is set we line up in "22," with 3 linebackers in the box. When we go from 3 linebacker to 2 in the box that is good for us. The Mike linebacker calls, "Move." When he does that we stem to what we call ''JOKER.'' We coach the Mike linebacker when to make his call. We do it from the cadence of the offense. The strong safety rolls up to the tight end side. We play cover 3 behind it. The Will linebacker walks to the outside and becomes a true outside linebacker. We don't want to play this defense all the time. It is there to confuse the offense and get stem movement in our defense. The tackle and nose move one technique toward the tight end. They are in a "31" defense to the tight end. We like the personnel we have playing this defense, particularly our strong safety. He is a good off-the-edge player. He is good on the blitz and just a real physical player.

When we go to "JOKER," the blitz package and calls are the same. We couldn't do this unless we tied it all together and used the same words. All we are doing is lining up in different places on the field. The key to doing this are the Sam and Mike linebackers. They have to understand gap changes. When we play three linebackers we play them vertical. There is not a lot of shuffling. The two linebackers look inside; they have to shuffle a little bit.

We have five different fronts. We script those fronts for games. We put all the different looks in the first 15 calls. We feel like the offense has to go in at halftime and go over every look they have seen. They may have seen them the week before, but they don't know the one we are going to run the most.

A huge advantage for us was playing our defensive end in a 7 technique. We kept it simple and brought the 9 technique down into the 7 and it really helped us. He is stepping in and ripping through with the outside arm. If he does the job the ball will bounce to the outside. Our outside linebacker and strong safety love that, because they make tackles.

If we put the defensive end in the 9 technique and slant him to the C gap it is called "CRASH." If the tackle comes out to B gap it is called "SMASH." If we do the same thing to the weak side we call it "GAP" and "SNAP." This is option slip stuff.

We feel like our fronts give the offense a lot of different looks. It is very simple. It gives us something to line up in.
