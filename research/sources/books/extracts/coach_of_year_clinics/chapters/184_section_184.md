Defensive Line Drills and Techniques

Penn State University

Thank you. It is a pleasure to be here at the clinic. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. This clinic has outlasted many others that have come and gone. You are a tribute to this clinic for coming out and supporting it.

Coaches, this is your clinic. If you have questions, ask them, and we'll answer them. I don't know all the answers. When I talk, I talk with the beliefs of what I am coaching. I'm going to talk about what I know. But anytime you have a question, stop me and ask it.

I'm going to move along rather quickly but at the same time be thorough. It doesn't matter what position you coach or the defense you run, this clinic should help. That includes offense. I'm going to talk about a few of the intangibles that help win football games. One of the most important things in football is to get the team ready. You have to teach and motivate for a team to perform. The key is to get players to play at the highest level of their ability. We have to push our kids to the point where they don't think they can do it any more. These players don't know what their highest level is because they haven't been pushed that hard. They have to learn to fall down and get back up.

If a player has feet and courage, that is what it takes to be a good defensive player. I ran into one of our players up in the hall before I came down here. He was our manager. We were getting ready to play Notre Dame, and our long snapper got hurt. This manager lined up and long-snapped the ball against Notre Dame for us.

If a kid has courage, you can teach him to be a big hitter. You can make him the best tackler on the team. If you have courage to hit somebody and feet to get to the ball, that's all defense is. If a kid has those talents, it is hard to keep him on the bench.

This next point is important in football but is also important in life's critical situations. You have to 
control what you can control. 
You can determine whether your team outhustles people. You can determine their getting to the ball. You determine whether your team is in shape. You determine whether your team is in condition. We play two halves of football. The first-half score means nothing. The final score is what counts. You determine whether your team outhits the opponent. We can control the fact that we outprepare people.

We control conditioning. In the winter program, if they won't pay the price and condition, they will get you beat on the goal line. They will lose on the goal line. We rate our players in several areas. We consider conditioning, the weight room, academics, and other areas.

When I have a meeting with my players I put on the blackboard, "Today is today. Make it count." However, it's more than that. It is the moment that counts. Any one of us could walk out of here and drop dead. Any tragedy could happen to any of us. You have to cherish the moment.

Here are some things that you build your defense around. You have to be a productive defense. We talk all the time about forcing turnover. Coach Paterno will come into our meeting and tell us that we need more interceptions and fumble recoveries. We have to force turnovers. The defense must have pride. They have to dominate and defend their area. They have to feel as if no one can run the ball at them. They will defend their area, and no one can run into their area.

We have a saying that is on the board in the linebackers' meeting room: Pay the toll. That is the linebacker area. It is just like the Pennsylvania Turnpike. To use it, you have to pay a toll. Anyone who comes into the linebacker area gets his head knocked off. If a guy crosses the linebacker's face, if he doesn't deck him, he gets a -3 on the grading scale. They are to dominate and control their area.
