The 4-3 Defensive Line Package

Saginaw Valley State University

I appreciate the warm welcome. I appreciate your help. We are trying to get established in Michigan. We feel like our team is an up-and-coming team in our conference. We are trying to get over the top in our conference and at the national level. We had an outstanding year last year but it was also disappointing on some points. A lot of people would be happy with a 7-3 record. But we collapsed in the end a little. The injury bug got us. We feel like we are building an outstanding program. We are still recruiting. If you have a player, let me know. At this level the recruiting never stops.

We went to the 4-3 defense two years ago. We had been playing the 4-4 for a number of years. After the first year we felt we needed to get the run stopped a heck of a lot better than we were doing. The biggest reason we went to the 4-3 was to stop the run. A lot of people will tell you the 4-3 won't stop the run. There are too many cutback lanes in it. We flatten out the run and that is what we wanted.

Today I'm going to talk about our fronts. Our main disguise is what we do up front with our front four people. We want to be as simple as possible. I'll talk about defensive line play. I coach the linebacker now but I am a former defensive line coach. We feel like that is where the success of the defense starts. I'll talk about linebacker play a little and a couple of coverages that put us over the hump. To finish up I'll talk about some things that give us problems. In any defense you have problems in certain areas.

The thing that has made us a good defense is playing an attacking front. I can't describe how much an impact that has made with our defense. It lets our defensive lineman come off the ball and try to make plays. Our best players are our defensive linemen. They get in a three-point stance, with their tails up a bit, and they get their heads in a crack and play. That has been the number one thing to improving our defense. This is our philosophy. Here is our identity. (1) We want to be the most aggressive defense in Division II football. (2) We want to develop our style of play. The biggest thing we want to do is try to get our kids to trust one another. Resiliency is what we call sudden change. That is when things go bad on offense and the defense has to hustle back into the game. A big key to defense is; BENDDON'T BREAK. In the sudden change situations we want to be at our toughest. We have to play with effort, have a good attitude, execute, and know our assignments. (3) We want to be technique oriented. We want to teach and play the best technique we possibly can. We want them to be athletes and play. We don't fill their heads with so much that they can't play for thinking. (4) We want to be great tacklers. We teach tackling every day. (5) We want to force turnovers.

Our defensive goals are posted for everyone to see. We developed these goal back at Pittsburg State when we were one of the top Division II teams in the country, year in and year out. I'll go through them briefly for you. (1) Scoring defense less than 12 points per game. We finished this year at 14 points a game. (2) We want to force 3 turnovers per game. (3) At least 5 TANGOS per game. A TANGO is a 3-and-out series. Those are not all our objective but they are the main ones we stress with our kids.

There are a lot of 4-3 teams out there. We have gotten help from the University of Miami. They were really helpful. Everybody's stuff is copied and that is where we get ours.

As far as tackling, the only thing I'm going to talk about is our little creed. Our kids memorize this. It is a saying. Here is what we want to do when we tackle people. These are fundamentals of good tackling. The first thing is to SEE WHAT YOU HIT. The next thing is KISS THE FOOTBALL. That leads up to cross-the-bow tackling. The third thing is TO CLUB UP AND GRAB.
