Zone Blocking Against Stunting Defenses

Hope College

I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this morning and for your coming to hear me speak. I am honored to be here. I have been very fortunate as a person and especially as a coach. I've had great support from my family my entire life. I am the seventh of eight children, and one of my brothers is here with us today. Steve is a high school coach down in Illinois. That is where the real coaching takes place. I love my job, but I admire and respect all of the high school coaches. I was hired at Hope College when I was only 24 years old. I became the head coach when I was 32. What I want to do now is tell you a little about what we are doing with our zone running game. I believe we have started having success again because we are able to teach our kids how to block in this system. I believe that I can teach our kids how to block the man across from them. It's an attitude, and I have to instill that in our linemen. I truly believe that the offensive line has to lead the team. They have to set the tempo and set morale. When things go badly, everyone looks to the offensive line to get it going again.

When I became the head coach two years ago, I felt there were two things that had to happen right away. One, we had to install a legitimate off-season program. We started four sections of a conditioning and weight-training class that our kids can take for credit. I really felt I had to be the key player in the offseason program if it was going to work, so I teach three of the four sections myself. We concentrate on quickness and change of direction before we ever step foot in the weight room. I would be glad to talk to any of you later about our off-season program, because we really like what we are doing and it works.

The second thing I changed right away was our offensive line coach. George Kraft had coached the offensive line at Hope for 28 years and had done a great job. I had no qualms with his coaching, but I felt it was imperative that I take over the offensive line myself. Again, it goes back to the attitude that I wanted our players to have. As far as I'm concerned, a team's attitude starts with the offensive line. Who better than the head coach to instill the attitude I wanted with the most important position on the field? I would like to say that I have learned and picked things up over the years from a number of people, and what I know is a compilation of their coaching. I've spent time with Tony Wise from the Chicago Bears, Mike DeBord at Michigan, Joe Moore at Notre Dame, Mike Jacobs from Ohio State, Mike Barry from Southern Cal, and George Kraft from Hope. The guy who has probably had the biggest impact on my coaching of the offensive line is Bill Callahan, who is the line coach for the Philadelphia Eagles. I was Billy's graduate assistant at the University of Illinois back in the mid-1980s.

Base Philosophy

I think it is important that I share some of my base philosophy with you so you know where I am coming from. When I was hired to be the head coach two years ago, the president of Hope College asked me what my goals for the program would be. I told him that I wanted to win and make sure that our players graduate. He said that we would both be happy if I could do that. The graduation part was easy. We have only had three players in 27 years who have not graduated from Hope. t is important for me and my staff to be in this game for the players. All of our coaches at Hope also teach. Even in our league, this is unusual now. There are many facets of our players' lives that I want our coaches to be concerned with. I want our coaches to be concerned not only with a young man's physical development, but also with his academic, social, and spiritual development. I don't believe that you have to preach to the kids, but they will act like their coach after a while. That is why it is important that we model ourselves in such a way that they can pick up on it. Discipline becomes more important to me as I get older. For me and our team, I stress it for three reasons: (1) if it will help us win, (2) if it will help our players graduate, and (3) if it will help our players become
