block them all. The tailback knows that. He has to outrun them, run over them, or make them miss. If he can't do that, we need to go recruiting again. The split guard and tackle are scooping hard. The 5 technique is held by the naked-bootleg threat of the quarterback.

The fullback aims for the tackle's inside leg. He blocks the linebacker. The only way he will block the linebacker inside the tight end is if he is on a blitz. The fullback lets the guard clear and tracks the inside linebacker. He usually goes into the same hole as the guard. He junction-blocks the linebacker. If the defensive end runs out to the sideline, the success of this play is whether the tackle and fullback can make their blocks. It is still a very good football play.

The tailback takes his flow lateral step. He runs downhill, keying the block of the tight end. The tailback generally hits up inside the end. If the defensive tackle is playing super-hard leverage, the tailback comes inside his block. When that happens, the success of the play is dependent on the blocks of the center and backside guard. I've seen plays where the defensive tackle and end skated hard to the sideline. The tailback turns the ball up inside for a good gain.

Your most powerful blocking position is when the defender is lined straight up on you. Your hips and his hips are aligned, and that is where most of your leverage comes from. When a defender has leverage, the blocker tries to take some kind of position step to square up his hips so he can knock the defender back off the ball. The first step is the short zone step. The crossover is the power step. When the blocker can cross over, he can deliver the blow.

Probably the next most frequent defense we face is the 4-3 defense. Now you are faced with a little different problem. By alignment, 4-3 teams take their defensive end and align him in a "ram technique." They align their defensive end at a 45-degree angle and run him through the V in the neck of the tight end. They have the tight end really outflanked. When we get a 4-3 defense, the first thing we have to do is get the wide receiver in the blocking scheme. We signal him to crack on the first safety inside. In the 4-3 defense, they have taken their linebackers and shifted strong. They shift the front to the weak side.

The tight end takes a drop step to square his hips and turns out on the defensive end. The wider the defensive end is, the more of a drop step he has to take. He probably can't hook the defensive end, but he can in certain situations. What he is trying to do is knock him back at the angle he is charging. The tight end does not want to absorb the blow. He attacks the defensive end. He wants to create as much distance between the end to the defensive tackle as he can.

The tackle blocks the tackle. He blocks down on the 3 technique and tries to knock the tackle back at an inside angle. The guard pulls inside the end for the Sam linebacker. The fullback comes off the tackle's leg and turns inside for the Mike linebacker. The reason we do that is because the center can't block the Mike linebacker on that fast-flow play.

The center, split guard, and tackle are hard-scooping on the backside. The tailback sees a wide 9 technique. He takes a lateral flow step and heads downhill at the butt of the tight end. Seventy-five percent of the time, he ends up going inside the tight end's block. The further the tight end can knock the defensive end off the ball, the more alleys the tailback has to run the ball.

This play has been outstanding for us on the goal line. I'll draw it up against a 6-2 defense. There are some people who don't like to pitch the ball on the goal line. We have not had a problem with that. We coach our men to catch all pitches with eyeball concentration. This is not a fast play. The tailback takes his flow step
