do. We make sure they do it; if they won't, we find someone else. We do not settle for anything less. When we say they won't, I mean attitude-wise they will not do what we ask. You find some kids that will not take to your coaching. Sometimes we may play a kid with less talent but one who will take coaching. If you have a great athlete and he does not do the things you ask him to do, I will assure you that he will get you beat somewhere down the road. You win with the little things: huddle, steps, alignment. Close games are won by the team that does the little things right. Little things will turn into big things. We insist that our players do the little things right.

We have a term that we use; we call it this: ''Be brilliant on the basics.'' Let me talk about fundamentals. Teaching must be done in the classroom and not on the field. At our school, the players report to the locker rooms immediately after school. Two days a week, the defensive players go into a classroom as soon as they get out of school. The offensive players go get taped or start getting dressed. At the end of 15 minutes, the offense and defense switch. While one group is getting dressed, the other team is in a team meeting. We go over our scouting reports, and we give the players handouts we have prepared. We begin to let them see what the big picture looks like. We do not want to waste time doing that on the field. We want to get after it once we get outside.

We feel it is very important to get a lot of repetitions on the field. The whistle blows; the coach is on the run. We want to coach them on the run. Get after them. Don't make it a laissez-faire attitude. Put a sense of urgency into your coaching. Coach them on the run. Our coaches are on the go! I am on the go. Our kids do not want to be the last one to get to a group drill. I jog to the drills, and the kids run to beat me there. We let them know when they are doing a good job. We let them know that we are interested in them becoming better people, better students, and better athletes.

Mental errors will not be tolerated. Players must know what to do and how to do it! That is part of our job. We have to be able to answer the whys and wherefores. Coach the kids; teach them what to do and how to do it. Offense is a team game. The team is far more important than the individual. We are not interested in setting statistical records. We played all 80 or our players in 11 of our 14 games this past year. That is more kids than we usually carry on the team, but we played them. We are only one of three teams in the history of Illinois that has scored over 600 points in one season. For the 13 years that I have been at Mt. Carmel, we have never had an area leading rusher, a leading passer, a leading receiver, or a leading anything. That is because we believe football is a team game. We spread the ball around, and we give everyone an opportunity on both sides of the football to play the game.

Consistency is a must in order to be successful. You must live and die with your offense, defense, and kicking game. You can't change things around in the middle of the season. I am amazed at some coaches who change their offense from year to year. How do you know how the people you will be playing against will adjust? You have to make a commitment to an offense that you believe in and go with it. You have to work on the offense. You can't be adding play after play week after week. You get down to the end of the season, and you need a roll of toilet paper to write down all the plays you have run for the season. Pick the things you feel are important, emphasize those points, and then have your players become great technicians.

We subscribe to the John Wooden philosophy. Before we worry what the other team is going to do, we want to be concerned with what we do. In August when we first get started, we never worry about working on the first opponent. We work our offense against our defense and our kicking game against our kicking game. We are going to make sure that our kids are good at what we need to do to be successful. We do not look at the scouting report of our first opponent until the week of that first game. We are going to be excellent at what we do first and foremost.

This sign is on our wall in our locker room: "Football should be fun!" Fun comes from doing things well and enjoying success. It is just like a classroom. It is fun to
