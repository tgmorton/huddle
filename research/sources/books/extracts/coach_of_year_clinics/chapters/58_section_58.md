TRIPS

We run the rip-twins look with the inside man on the hash mark.

RIP TWINS

Now, there are so many things you can do. You do not want to confuse your kids. You do not want to do all of this on offense and beat yourself. You still need to keep it simple, but you can keep the offense so that you do not get confused and the kids do not get confused. I think that is the trend today. Also, a lot of coaches are using motion with the different sets. Some coaches go to it too much at the high school level, and the kids get confused. When that happens, they do not execute well. If our kids do not execute the new plays that we put in very well, then I put them in the recycle bin. If a play is in there, I will not use it for the game. If it will confuse anyone on the team, we are not going to use the play. That is my rule. I do not want to beat myself. Most teams beat themselves. We won a lot of games because the other team beat themselves and not because we were a better football team. If you can cut down on your mistakes, then you have a chance of winning the game. What I am saying is this: On motion, formations, and new plays, you need to be careful to make sure you know what you are doing.

I would like a balance between the run and pass at 50-50. That is never going to happen. It would be nice if it were at 60-40. It would be good if it were 70-30. We are about 80-20. The parents of our wide receivers think we run 95 percent of the time and pass 5 percent of the time. But look, if we run the option and the defense can't stop us, what do you do? Do you stop running the option and throw the ball? No! I feel that if you work on the pass, you will be able to throw the ball. If you are behind in a game, you have the chance to come back and win that game if you have a decent passing attack.

I get tired of hearing TV commentators say that teams that run the wishbone cannot come back. They get in the fourth quarter, and that is when they start telling everyone that the team is in trouble if they are behind. Sometimes they are right. Those wishbone teams just have to grind out the yardage. I keep asking this question when I see teams that have trouble coming from behind: Why can't they put in some simple pass plays with a really strong running attack, so if you do get behind, you have a chance to come back?

To me there is nothing better than the play-action pass. We all score from those plays. I think you need some type of bootleg action; you may have a run-out action. We do not sprint out, but we have a semi-sprint. Where we may be different from other people is this. We put in a three-step, five-step, and seven-step package. This is so that if we do need a certain type of pass in a given situation, we can do that play.

From the three-step drop we have our quick-out, slant, and fade routes. From the five-step drop we throw the square-in route and a streak route. Bill Walsh said that if you can complete two or three streak routes per season, that it is a successful play for you. That is about what we do for the season. On the seven-step drop we run the deep out, curl route, and a play that we call scissors. It has been a good play for us. When we are behind, we run this play. It is my favorite play. It is good against the zone or man. BYU was using this play in the 1980s. They do not do this much anymore, but they have variations of the play.

This play is out of our ace formation. The way we teach the seven-step drop is three big steps and four quick steps. It is really good against man coverage.
