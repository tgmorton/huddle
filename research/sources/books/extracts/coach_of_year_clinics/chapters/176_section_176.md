Pass Coverages in the Eight-Man Front

Michigan State University

Thank you, gentlemen. First of all, I'd like to tell you that it is very much a pleasure for us to come over here and visit with you. I would like to thank each and every high school coach in the state of Michigan. I think you do an outstanding job from a professional standpoint of developing players for college. Anything that we can do to help you develop professionally, we would be pleased to do. Don't hesitate to ask. Come visit us during spring practice.

I'm going to talk about a couple of things here. Any of you who have heard me speak before know I'm hung up on developing the right kind of attitude and chemistry on your team. After that I want to talk about the eight-man front and man-to-man coverage. Most pro teams are playing this coverage now. More and more colleges are going to it, and you could play it very effectively in high school.

I assume you have some of the same problems with your players that we have with ours. The levels are different, but the problems are the same. I would like to talk to anybody here who has any suggestions and can help us in terms of managing young people. We need to get them to do the right things from a behavioral, character, disciplinary, and attitude standpoint. We spend quite a bit of time on that.

We did an interesting thing about a week or 10 days ago. We brought a sports psychologist in to work with our team for three days. He talked to our team about what the team felt and thought. Sometimes we as coaches lose sight of that a bit. This guy had a word that he went through. It was called ''HALT." He had the players write down on a piece of paper what the letters stood for. There were no coaches around. The H stands for, "What are you hungry for?" The A was, "What are you angry about?" The L was, "What are you lonely about?" The last one, T, stood for, ''What are you tired of?"

It was interesting what the players wrote down. You can find out a lot about your team. You need to know what they think and where they are mentally. We are all guilty of relying on personal perception. Sometimes it is good to stand back and view things from the other person's point of view. It did a lot of good for the coaches to see what the players were thinking. It opened my eyes up to a lot of things.

My view of the off-season program is what we need to develop in the players. I want to teach them how to give effort and develop mental toughness. We make it hard. We make them finish every play and give maximum effort. I see all those things as tremendous benefits. But if we don't sell that to the players, all they think is, "I'm tired of running every day." If that is their attitude about running, they are not going to do a very good job of it, because they are not goal oriented in their approach at all. They don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. We didn't make a very good road map for them so they could understand why they were doing what they were doing and how it was going to benefit them.

The last two weeks, I feel we have done a much better job with our team because of our understanding. Does that mean we are compromising our values, principles, and integrity with the way we go about coaching? Not at all. But we can do our job better when we understand where they are coming from. Believe me when I tell you that.

I think the reason we exist as coaches is to help people be successful. If they are successful, we will win games. How do you get them to be successful? The key is consistency in performance. That makes anyone successful in whatever they do. Success is based on performance. What makes people have good performance? They have to want to do it. That is the most important thing.
