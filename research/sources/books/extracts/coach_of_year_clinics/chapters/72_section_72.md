We see a lot of 4-4 looks. Here is how we block against it. The left guard and tackle have to block the man on the guard and the offside linebacker. The guard and tackle take their inside steps. If the defensive tackle comes hard inside the guard, the guard blocks him, and the tackle goes for the offside linebacker. If he plays the guard, the tackle blocks him, and the guard comes off on the linebacker. When we first started to run this against this defense, we had the halfback going in to block the onside linebacker. But all that did was muck up the play. We have found the inside linebacker follows the halfback out. Instead of going in on the inside linebacker, the linebacker comes out to the halfback.

What we follow that up with is a "draw trap pass." On this play, everything is blocked the same way. The split end runs a curl pattern. The halfback has a free release and runs to the flat. If the linebacker runs back under the curl, the quarterback hits the halfback. If the linebacker jumps the halfback, the quarterback hits the curl pattern. We key the inside linebacker. He can't be right. Where he goes, we throw opposite.

We run a weak-side sweep. To be frank, this play has not been as consistent as we need it to be. We are going to work harder on this play. We get a lot of the 4-3 look. We played Penn State a few years ago in Provo. We ran the ball 50 times and threw it 20. We didn't have any idea the run would work out that way. Of the 50 runs, 25 were weak-side sweep. The split end cracks on the outside linebacker. The tackle downblocks the man over the guard. The guard pulled for the corner. The halfback chops the defensive end. The center blocks the onside gap and the backside scoops.

We are big on option-type routes for our receivers. We like to run this off the right hash mark. We bring the flanker in motion back to the quarterback. We could line up in the wide slot to the field. The reason we like to motion is so the defense has to tip their coverage. If the corner goes with the motion, we feel that is man coverage, and that is what we want. The fullback has a free release. He runs a 5-and-5 route, that is, 5 yards downfield and 5 yards from the sideline. Once the fullback finds out it is man, he keeps going up the sideline. The tight end takes an inside release and works upfield.

As the quarterback drops, he keys the outside linebacker. If he comes, we have no one to block him. The back is looking at the outside linebacker. If the linebacker blitzes, he gets the ball right now on the hot route. The tight end finds who is picking him up. He carries him downfield 10 yards, leans in, and pressreleases to the outside.

If we read zone coverage, we run zone routes. The fullback has a free release and runs his 5-by-5 route. The flanker reads zone, runs a 6-yard curl, and sets
