That is the deal right now. The reason they do that is because it attacks the protection scheme. The offense has problems because they do not know who is coming or who is dropping. When they have problems protecting the quarterback, they also have problems with the throwing lanes for the quarterback to throw the ball out of. The quarterbacks throw out of a vision lane. When those lanes change, those quarterbacks have to change. In the NFL, if you can rush the quarterback, you can stop them. If you can't rush them, you are not going to stop them.

9. The zone defenses offer advantages as the field shortens. 

This is something I have talked about for years. When I first started coaching, we were not very good down deep. The reason was that we did not practice defending the red zone. We talked about it, and we discussed strategy, but we just went over it. We did not spend time down in the red zone. The reason that the zone defense is good in the red zone is because the offense only uses certain passes down deep. You can get the interception down deep, and you can get your safeties involved in run support. You can actually be in a nine-man front without subbing for the nine men.

10. Zone personnel is less important. 

You just do not have to have as good a player to play the zone. This is especially true if you get good at playing zone. f you are going to play man to man, you have to have one thing and one thing only: That is makeup speed. Sooner or later, you are going to get beat, and you better have someone lined up back deep who can make up for it. If you have four players who can fly, you can play a lot of man-to-man coverage. I have some players on defense who can fly, but they can't fly as fast as those guys from Florida. That is why we have to play some zone. We also have to play some man. Zone is a personnel thing. You have a better chance of getting a good cover with the personnel that you have in the zone than you do in man. When you go man to man, you have to depend on the blitzes getting there to cover up for your coverage problems.

Those are the 10 commandments of zone defense. I am going to go through 10 zones. All of these facets are going to make up these coverages. You can take three or four of these and make up your own coverages. You can pull out two or three of these and make them your cover two, or whatever you want it to be. I will explain these to you as best I can in a short period of time.

The first cover is universal. It is what everyone plays. It is three deep, four short-strong. This was played back about 20 years ago. There never was such a thing as a weak zone. Basically, what we want to do is to go three deep. We are going to put the two corners and free safety in the deep thirds. Now I am going to give you an overview of all zone coverages. I will not be able to go over every detail of each coverage. I have the diagrams drawn up for an odd alignment, but I did not put the linemen down.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTSTRONG

Also, I have them drawn up for an even alignment, which has three linebackers. Basically, all this on the diagram is a three-deep zone. We can go through all of the commandments again and see that we are three deep. We are taking away the deep areas and the underneath areas of the field by lining up in those areas. We do not want to give up a completion in those areas. We are not going to give up a deep ball.

We have the same three deep with four short strong with the four-man front. We have three deep, we have four short, and we are in a strong zone. We have the even front.
