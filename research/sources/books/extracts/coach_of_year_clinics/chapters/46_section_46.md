The Passing Attack In The Red Zone

University Of Georgia

When you go to a clinic, it is good to talk to other people and share ideas. It is good to talk about your program and their program as far as what is going on. Most of you have a good idea of what you want to do on both sides of the ball, or you would not be coaching. It is good to have a good sense of direction.

It is also important to know that the game changes, and you have to keep up with what happens in football. You have to keep up with the rule changes and use them to your advantage. I think it is important as a coach, regardless of the level you are on, to be objective and coachable, to branch out and get new ideas.

I am not the type of coach who would get up here and preach to you. There are a lot of things we can do better. Last year we were not a very good football team. We had flashes of being a good team, but when you make changes in football, it is difficult to get things across. Hopefully, we will be able to do a better job next year. You must be able to articulate what you are doing to the players. The bottom line is, How are they going to do when the band plays on Friday night at 7:30? Basically, it gets down to what they can handle. As college coaches, we spend a lot of time watching other schools. We have two of the top teams in the country in our division of our league. We have some lofty goals to reach just to be competitive. I am sure it is the same for you.

The point I want to make is this. We want to analyze our past season. That is what we are doing now. We know what won for us last season. We also know what got us beat. As situations develop during the course of the season, the quicker your team learns how to adjust to those situations that won for you and got you beat, the better a team you will be next year. It does not matter if you have a lot of players back or not. You can reflect to them and point out what happened and how the team reacted to those situations.

For instance, our team handled overtime situations very well. They showed a lot of poise and did a great job of handling what we needed to do to win the game. Ten of the 11 games we played last year were decided in the last five minutes. This includes the Tennessee game, where we were inside their 20-yard line and were behind 10 points. We have a lot of games that are decided by certain situations and how the team reacts to them. I want to make sure that I emphasize to you, as teachers of the game and coaches, that we are dealing with kids a lot younger than we are.

One thing I learned when I was coaching at Oklahoma with Barry Switzer was the mind-set of the players. No matter what happened in those situations, we expected to win. We counted on that. When I took over at Marshall University, it was the same. I am not sure that our kids have that mind-set yet. A lot of that is based on success or the lack of success. Some of the other teams we played, we felt, had an idea that they were going to lose to us. When it starts getting tough, teams are going to lose games more than they are going to win games. Teams start making mistakes, and it causes them to lose.

From a skilled level, it does not matter if you want to run a three-back set, a two-back set, or a one-back set. It is immaterial to me today. Formations do not win for you. What wins for you are the players. Some of you are really good coaches one year, and the next year you are not quite as good because you do not have those good players. Sometimes egos get in the way.

You need to develop something good, regardless of what you do. You have to be able to take advantage of what the defense gives you. In the collegiate game today, with all of the multiple defenses and fronts and defensive coverages, it becomes a real guessing game for us. I do not like to guess. On any decision I have to make, I want to eliminate as many risks as I can in trying to be successful. If you are spending a lot of time
