Speed and Power Development

Baylor University

We have a new head football coach at Baylor. Dave Roberts is the new coach. Any time you have a new coach, you have a lot of things to go over. We are trying to get used to each other. We get there early and stay late. It has been a long winter season for us, and we start testing next week. Before I was at Baylor University, I was at Southern California for four years. Before that, I was an assistant at the University of Missouri for seven years. All of you Michigan fans will get to see us about the third game of the year. I know we will just be a scrimmage game for Michigan. I want to see if I can find Lloyd Carr and shake his hand now, because I know I will not be able to get to him after our game next fall. The players will carry him off the field, and I do not want to get into that.

The thing that I do when I go to clinics is this. I want to learn some things that will provoke me into thinking a little. Also, I want to learn some things that I can take back and put into our off-season program. Hopefully, I will be able to provide you with both of those things tonight.

The things I am going to talk about are things that I have learned from others. Just like you, as a coach I am going to visit with others, watch film, and break down workouts. I am going to learn from coaches around the nation who I think are smarter than I am in one way or the other. The material that I will present is not necessarily anything I have invented. It is material that I have learned from others. At times, I will refer to those coaches.

The first quote is from a book, 
Periodization of Strength 
by
Tudor Bompa. Tudor is one of the guys with an accent. If he is farther away from home than 100 miles and he has slides, that makes him an expert. Perhaps tonight I am an expert. I may sound like I have an accent to some of you. This is what Tudor said: "Flexibility can be improved day to day; strength, week to week; speed, month to month; work capacity, year

to year." Is that true? From what I am finding out by applying some principles, it is true. If you do the right thing flexibility-wise, you can be more flexible today than you were before. That is true the next day and the next day, next day and the next day. Can strength be improved week to week? Yes! It can if you do the right things from week to week. We all have experienced that.

Speed is month to month. That sounds a little tougher. Speed is tougher to improve. We used to start out by getting into an aerobic base. We would lift weights. After so many weeks, we would get into conditioning. Then we would worry about speed training. If speed is month to month, we had better start training on speed right from the get-go.

Michael Johnson is a graduate of Baylor University. He still comes down and trains. He is going to race Donavan Bailey this summer in June. It will be a 150-meter match race for a million dollars. After the Olympics, Michael took some time off. Then he did a lot of commercials, and then he started back in training. He did not start off by getting a base. He started on speed work first. The race is going to be a race to see who can run the 150 meters the fastest the most number of times.

So, speed is month to month, and it needs to be worked on from the very beginning in some way. We will get into that later.

Work capacity is year to year. Work capacity is fitness with the ability to handle the load that you are doing. It is the ability to handle practice. We see that each year with our players. The freshmen and sophomores are going through practice, and it is killing them. They may be going through the off-season drills, and they are crawling around as if they are dying. The seniors are cool. They want to know what is wrong with the
