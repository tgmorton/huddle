Scout Team Utilization

Buffalo High School, Wyoming

I consider it a privilege to be speaking here today. John Burke suggested that I tell you a little about my background. I have coached high school football for 10 years. I coached the defensive line for John Burke for four years at Douglas County High School in Castle Rock, Colorado. I coached the offensive line for Mike McCall for three years at Douglas County. For the past three years, I have coached at Buffalo High School in Buffalo, Wyoming. My primary responsibility is the scout team and the tight ends. As my résumé indicated, I started coaching a little late in life.

In Wyoming high school football, we have four classifications: 1A to 4A, with the largest being 4A. In 1995, Buffalo was the 2A runner-up and was state champ in 1996. Mike Moon is the head coach and does an outstanding job. This past year was his fourth state championship.

Buffalo High School is located, as you might guess, in Buffalo, Wyoming. It is located 430 miles north on I-25 where it ends. We are about 60 miles from the Montana state line. The population of Buffalo is about 3500, on a good day. As in most small towns, we have great community support for our athletic events. I am sure you have heard the standard joke: "If you want to rob a bank, do it on Friday night, because everyone will be at the football game." Actually, I do not think it would do you any good, because there is no money in the banks.

At Buffalo High School, we have 370 students. We have 60 to 65 kids out for football. We have about 40 on the varsity and 25 freshmen. There is another high school in our county. It is located 40 miles south of Buffalo. It is in Koycee. They have 85 students in their school. The WHSAA allows their kids who want to play football to travel to Buffalo to be a part of our team. We have about four kids who take advantage of this. They travel 80 miles to be on our team. We take 65 players to Black Hills State University in August for our four-a-day football camp. Black Hills State is located in Spearfish, South Dakota, and is about 150 miles east of Buffalo.

We do not platoon at Buffalo. Our average road game is over 200 miles one way. Because of the distance some of our kids have to travel, we have a strict two-hour limit on our practice schedules.

This is what our normal practice looks like. On Monday we talk and walk through our offensive and defensive game plan. We do some heavy conditioning as well. On Tuesday we work on team offense and scout-team defense. On Wednesday we work on team defense and scout-team offense.

On Thursday we do something a little different. Our kids come to practice at 6:30 in the morning. We practice one hour and fifteen minutes until 7:30 A.M. This practice is in helmets and shorts. We run through the offensive and defensive game plans and the kicking game. We feel this gives them extra time before the game. On road trips, we usually have to leave by 11 A.M. or 12 noon on Friday to be there in time for the games. Going in early on Thursday gives us some extra time.

Let's talk about the scout team. It is full of all kinds of surprises. You have to know when to chew them out, and you have to know when to say "nice job."

How many of you have seen the movie 
Rudy? 
Looks like about 25 percent. That is not bad, because the rest of my talk is based on the movie 
Rudy 
Three years ago, we went to Black Hills State for our camp. We stayed in a college dorm that had a TV lounge. One night we were in the TV lounge and the movie 
Rudy 
just happened to be on. Most of our kids watched the movie from start to finish. If you have not seen the movie, you should. It is a great training film, and it is a great
