Philosophy and Organization

Campbell High School, Hawaii

I have a lot of notes that I will be referring to today. It is an honor to be here. I want to thank Rick Sakata for giving me the opportunity to speak. When I was asked to speak, I was apprehensive about speaking before such a large group. My wife told me to suck it up and to quit complaining. She said, "It will be a piece of cake." Some of you know my wife. She can talk. She has a bachelor's degree from Harvard and a master's from Yale. She is getting a doctorate from the University of Hawaii. Next month she will be speaking before 500 physicians at the National Cancer Institute in Washington, D.C. This is her topic: "The Role of Gap-Junctional Communication on Human Papilloma Virus-Induced Cervical Dysplasia." Wow! It makes my topic seem a little lame by comparison. Here we go.

In 19941 became coach at Campbell High School, which is my alma mater. I played football for Campbell High. Many of you know about our poor record when I was a player. We did not win one game. We were terrible. Our futility on the gridiron is well documented. We have been playing football since 1964. From 1964 to 1993 we only had four winning seasons. We had never won a play-off game.

People ask me how we turned the program around since 1994. We have had three winning seasons in a row. In 1994 we went 7-3, in 1995 we were 7-3, and in 1996 we were 9-3. The big question I get is why we have to lose three games each year. I do not know. A lot of it has to do with our schedule and our big rival Waianae High School.

To change the program, there were several things we had to do. The first thing we had to do was to set a vigorous weight-training program. We did this by making it mandatory for all football players to enroll in a seventh period weight-training class for credit. They come to class at 2:20 P.M., and they lift until 3:30.

The second thing we did was to demand discipline through changes in their behavior both on the field and off the field. To change any program quickly, you must have a foundation and a philosophy that you believe in. It must be a philosophy that will serve and guide you throughout your coaching career.

There are three elements of the Campbell High School program: philosophy, off-field activities, and on-field activities. I will hit practice organization later, but first I want to talk about our philosophy.

First, treat kids fairly. By this we mean what 
we 
think is fair. It could be unfair to someone else. Be honest and consistent. We deal straight up and tell it like it is. Kids can tell if you do not tell the truth.

Second, we must coach with enthusiasm. If you are not excited, don't expect the players to be. Is football fun? Winning is fun. If you are losing, it is not fun; however, you cannot guarantee winning. It is no fun if you are in a fight and someone is beating the crap out of you.

Third, we want to play the best 11. That means both ways if needed. You want to get the kids to a position where they have a chance to win. As coaches, we must do our utmost to prepare them for the chance to win. We tell our players to play hard. We do not buy the excuse that they are tired. This is not basketball or some other sport where you can raise your hand and come out of the game. We do not care how tired you are; you are going to play. You are going to do it for the team. We have found that no football player has ever missed a school dance or a chance to party after the game. After the game they find a lot of energy. If they can play two ways, they do.

This is our philosophy:

1. We want to physically dominate our opponent. We want to do it quickly. We go for it in the first quarter. We want to plant the seed of doubt in them that we are better and more physical than they are.
