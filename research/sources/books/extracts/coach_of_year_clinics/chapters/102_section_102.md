We have 20 to 25 plays written down on a script sheet. It is a nine-on-seven drill script sheet, and we run our plays in sequence. We list 20 to 25 plays to work on that day. We may not get all of them off. Each coach has the list of plays we are working on. On our sevenon-seven drill, we do the same.

During this period the 0 line and D line will be working on run blocking for the first 10 minutes. For the second 10 minutes they do pass blocking. It is a drill for the offense. This is where the defensive coach works on new things with his players. Everything is offense in this period.

Then we go to period 3. This is our team period. Now we work against the defense that we expect to see. We do everything by situations. We have the areas of the field covered. We work on being backed up, in the danger zone, and on the one-yard line. We have to be prepared to come out of our end zone.

We practice as if we are going in to score, and when we are in the red zone, we work on short yardage, say, 3rd and 2. We work on ball control and controlling the clock. We practice motion and any special play. Also, we work on our two-minute offense.

We have a team offense script. All of our offensive coaches have this list. We work on all of the situations. We list the number of the play, the hash, down and distance, formation, play, and against what defense. We list special situations and goal-line plays. We work against all situations that we feel we need to cover for the game that week. We try to get them all into that time frame of 20 minutes.

Now we honk the horn and go to block B. Now all of the JV players will come together and run the offense. All of the varsity will play offense against the JVs. If you have a player who wants to play both ways and he has been working on offense, now he can go and work with the defense. He will get the same amount of time. If he is a first-team offensive player, instead of playing scout team during the first defensive emphasis, he is with the defense working on plays.

We switch after 20 minutes and work JVs on defense and the varsity on offense. We do the drill all over again. The coaches never leave. They work all of the JVs, and they coach all of the varsity. They stay on one side of the field, and the players switch.

Next we go to seven-on-seven again, but now we are working on defense. We work one-on-one and go over our coverages.

The last part of the defense sessions is our team defense. This is where we work on our stunts and variations. Again, we have the plays scripted that we want our defense to work on that particular day.

The conditioning drills are individual. We break up with individual coaches by positions. Each group works on conditioning.

Next, we have a postpractice session. An opportunity is not a good thing for our players. If they are one second late, they get one opportunity. If they are more than 15 minutes late, they get two opportunities. At the conclusion of practice, we line everyone up on the sideline. We call the roll of opportunity victims. They come out and go on the goal line. The team is on the sideline, and they are not going to say a word. It is punishment with the whole team watching. Everyone knows they must pay the price equally, no matter who they are. The team will encourage them during the punishment. One opportunity consists of a 200-yard sprint followed by a 200-yard jog and drop, followed by a 200-yard bear crawl, followed by a 200-yard roll. That is 
one 
opportunity. After one, they never want to do one again. They make a real effort to be on time.

If you want, I will send you a copy of our practice schedule. Drop me a line. Thanks. Again, I want to thank Rick Sakata.
