do not want to throw the football. We start out by building the running game.

Now, we are in a position where hopefully we can move forward. We have stuck with our system the past three years. In our second year there, we were fourth in the country in rushing the football. This year we were about 14th. This year we were between 10th and 15th. The first year at Clemson, we led the nation in turnover ratio. We have been in the top 15 in the nation in that category each year. We spend a lot of time working on holding on to the football on offense and trying to knock it loose when we are on defense.

If you will go back and look at all of the teams through the years that were successful, you will find that they all ran the football. When I was growing up, the winning teams were Michigan, Ohio State, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Alabama. They all ran the football. At that time, a lot of them were wishbone teams. They were all able to run the football. They all played good defense. They were all on the plus side on turnovers. They were consistently good.

Let me give you some great stats from the NFL. They are from 1995. If your quarterback threw for over 300 yards, you would win 47 percent of the time. If he threw for over 400 yards, you would win 52 percent of the time. If you had a 100-yard rusher in the game, you would win 89 percent of the time. If you just ran the ball 40 times, you won 92 percent of the time. Those are impressive stats to me.

In our conference in 1995, it was amazing how close our stats were to the NFL. In our league, if you passed for 200 yards, you won 52 percent of the time. If you passed for 300 yards, you still won only 52 percent of the time. If you rushed the ball for over 200 yards in our league in 1995, you won 94 percent of the time. If you rushed for under 200 yards per game, you only won 26 percent of the time. Again, those are convincing stats.

After we leave our philosophy, we get into what we call our system. This is true for the offense, defense, or kicking game. It must fit our philosophy. We feel the system must be flexible. A lot of things dictate what we do in our system. Some teams have systems, and their personnel must fit their system. We are not really that way. We take our personnel and make it fit within our philosophy. It must fit our team. In our system now, we have more of a power game. That is because of the tailback that we have. He is not a slashing type of runner. We have to take our quarterback and do what is best for him. We try to tailor our system to fit our talent. Again, our system must fit our philosophy. We must be able to run the ball. We must be flexible. We must be willing to change the system at any time during the year to fit our team.

In our offensive system for our running game, the first thing we want is the power game. We want to be able to take the fullback out of the I formation and go straight at the defense. We want to be able to take the tailback out of the I formation and go straight at the defense. This is where we start. We start with just a simple belly play to our fullback and a simple power play to our tailback.

The second part of our running game is that we want to run the option game. We are not an option team, but we will always have an option in our attack. We will always have one option play, regardless of our offense. If a team does not have an option in their system, the defense can do a lot of different things. They can play unsoundly and get by with it. If the option does show up, the defense must be accountable for the dive, the quarterback, and the pitch. It only takes one time for the option to burn a defense. We will always have an option play. We keep it very simple. We do not read the option, but we always have one option. When the defense breaks us down on Sunday, they are going to see an option play.

The third part of our system is that we run the misdirection. That play can be a number of things for us. The reverse may be the misdirection play for us. We use different things for our misdirection in our offensive system. We may use the naked reverse and the bootleg plays as our misdirection.

In our running game, we face the 4-3 defense. We are not a 4-3 team; we are a 3-4 defense. Most people in college football have gone to the 4-3 defensive
