Our Best Pass Plays

University of Northern Colorado

Thank you very much. I have to pinch myself every morning to believe that we won the national championship. First, I want to thank the high school coaches from the state of Colorado. Fellows, we won the championship with a bunch of Colorado boys. Thank you very much, Colorado coaches. Out of 100 players on our football team, 87 of them were from the great state of Colorado. Again, thanks. We just recruited 33 more players from the state of Colorado. "Dance with the one that brung you."

I grew up one of 12 children in Lincoln, Nebraska. People ask me why I got into coaching. I have to tell them it was because of the competitiveness that ran in my family. I will tell you one story to illustrate. I will tell you the story about my brothers Jimmy and Johnny. We were playing on a Little League baseball team. We were playing for the city championship. My brother Jimmy was one of those kids who, anytime anything happened that he did not like, would get into a fist fight. If the other team would bean one of our batters, he would get after them. If the other team gave him any reason to get into it, Jimmy would be in the middle of it. That was his style. I prided myself on having a nice, clean uniform after the game. I had my uniform washed before the next game for each game. Jimmy did not have his uniform washed all summer. He was a grub. Our team and coach loved him, and he was a prince of a player to coach. He was everything you would want in a Little League player. However, we got to the city championships, where we got to play under the lights for the first time. The first time we came to bat, naturally they hit Jimmy with a pitch. Jimmy ran out to the mound and lit into the pitcher. Both benches cleared, but they threw Jimmy out of the game. The coach loved Jimmy so much, he let him go down and coach third base the rest of the game.

The game came down to the last inning, and I had my chance to win the game. The bases were loaded, and the score was tied. There was no one out. I looked down to first base but saw no signal. I looked down to third base and again saw no signal. I was just waiting to make contact to win the game. The pitcher started his windup, and I looked down and saw a runner breaking from third base. My first thought was, "Did I miss the signal? Was a squeeze play on?" The pitcher speeded up his windup and threw the ball home. The catcher grabbed the ball and put the tag on the runner. The umpire yelled, "You're out!" My brother Jimmy got up and yelled, ''You can't throw me out. I am the third base coach." Competitor! They made him go sit with my mom after that.

I do have one story to tell you before we get into X's and O's. There were four old men who were golfing partners. The four golfers had a pact. Whoever died first would find some way to get back to the others and let them know how the hereafter was. Winter came, and they quit playing golf. That winter, Ernie passed away. Spring came, and the three old men went out to play golf for the first time. After they teed off, they heard a strange voice: "Hey, fellows!" They recognized the voice. "Is that you, Ernie?" The voice replied, "Yes, it is Ernie. Did you forget about our deal?'' The guys said, "No, we did make a deal. Tell us, Ernie, what is it all about?" This was his reply: "You can't believe it. You get up in the morning, and the first thing you do is have sex. Then you go for a walk. When you come back, you have a drink and then eat. Then you have sex again and then relax awhile. Then you have a drink, then eat, and then have sex again. All day long all you do is eat, drink, have sex, and take a walk. It goes on day after day." The other golfers said, "Wow! Ernie, we knew heaven would be great, but we had no idea it would be that great." Ernie replied, "Heaven? Hell, I am in Billings, Montana." Reincarnation! Come on, guys.

Now that I am getting a little older, I try to sneak away at noon to take a little nap during our fall practice two-a-day practices. I wanted to stay fresh so I could stay
