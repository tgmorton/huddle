think we play the most demanding schedule in the state of Ohio in Division I, which is the highest. In Ohio you must qualify to get into the play-offs. You have to make the final 16 teams in the divisions to get into the state play-offs. When you get into the top four in your region, you become one of the top 16 teams in the state, and you get into the championship play-offs. I have been at Lima Senior High School for 13 years now. Every one of the teams on our schedule has been in the Division I state play-off over the 13 years I have been at Lima. Three of those teamsSt. Francis, Princeton, and Fairfieldhave won the state championship since I have been at Lima. And Cleveland St. Ignatius has won several state championships. Our schedule has really dominated the play-offs over the last 13 years.

I do want to show you some charts that I think will help you, especially the young coaches who are here. I like them, and they are things that I have stolen over the years. I would be glad to send them to you if you would write me. I have spoken to several clinics recently, and I have mailed several packets to coaches asking about our charts. Write to Coach Leonard Rush, Lima Senior High School, 600 South Pierce Street, Lima, Ohio 45804; telephone 1-419-998-2051.

Let me tell you a little about our school. We are located in northwest Ohio. We are between Toledo and Dayton. We are in the Greater Miami conference. Our league is based in Cincinnati. We play a lot of the Cincinnati schools. We do a lot of traveling. A close game to us is a two-hour bus trip. We added Massillon to our schedule this year, and that was a three-hour bus trip. We had 566 males in our top three grades last year. The Division II break is at 525 males. We are a small Division I school. We are the smallest Division I school to win the state since they started using the setup. In 41 years of football, Lima Senior has had only five losing seasons. Our expectations are to win.

I started talking about our coaching staff. This is how we break our staff down: We have five coaches working on offense and six coaches on defense. Three of these are volunteer coaches. This is how we treat the volunteer coaches. If you come to me and ask me if you can be a volunteer coach, this is what I tell you. You must be in attendance for everything that we do. If you do not want to do that, then you do not want to volunteer for us. So you can see that our volunteer coaches are full-time assistants.

We have three freshman coaches. We have grades 9 to 12 in our building. We have three middle schools that have two coaches at each level. That is the way our program is broken down.

I am going to talk about some of the things we did differently this past year. We give them stars to put on their helmets. Our kids like that type of motivation. Our kids are city kids. If they like that, we will give it to them. We decided this year to give team awards instead of individual awards. If we win, everyone gets a star on his helmet.
