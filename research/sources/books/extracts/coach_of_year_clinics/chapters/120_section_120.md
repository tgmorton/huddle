to break the momentum to cross over and plant. If the fourth step is too long, he will never be able to throw the ball without gathering his feet. We do these four drills every day. We make sure we are on the field to supervise them. We want reps, reps, and more reps.

Next we go to a series of quarterback drop drills. The quarterback is not throwing the football; he is dropping back. We do all of these drills on the lines. We start on the sideline.

First is the distance drop. I blow a whistle, and they start the drill. The quarterbacks drop all the way across the field. It is full speed all the way across the field. We want them to stay on the line and to keep the head up and shoulders level and work the football. This is sideline to sideline. The drop is second nature, and it helps lengthen the drop. This is how we warm up. You can vary the distance if you want. At times in practice, we may have them drop 100 yards. We put them on the goal line and have them drop all the way down the field. This is usually after they have made several mistakes.

Next is the swivel-hips drill. Again, they start out on the sideline. I blow the whistle, and they are going to drop. I blow the whistle again, and they swivel or rotate the hips. We want them to stay on the midline. We do this all the way across the field. I blow the whistle, and they rotate. On every whistle they must rotate the hips. We want them to try to stay on the midline. We want them to keep their feet working.

The third drill is the carioca drop. This drill is used to improve footwork. The upper body remains the same. This drill goes well with our big-five drop, which I will discuss later. Again, we are sideline to sideline. We start out and carioca all the way across the field. We want to stay on the midline. The upper body remains the same. The lower body must do the work in a carioca-type style. It is very good for developing footwork. We like to stress this point with our quarterbacks. Playing quarterback starts from the ground up. Feet, feet! If they have good feet, they have a chance.

Next is the tapioca drop. It is the same as the carioca drop except the quarterback is giving a quick washing-machine action. We want real short choppy steps. We go from the sideline to the hash mark on this drill. We start out by straddling the sideline. Everything is the same as the carioca drill, except we are speeding things up. Again, this drill goes well with our quick-five action. We do not take many seven-step drops anymore. The defensive ends in college are too good. We are a quick-five-action team and a big-five team.

The fifth drill is what we call our alternate drops. Now the mind and body must work together. It is the same thing. They start on the sideline. We may be working on the big five, quick five that day, or we may be working on three quick steps. We may be going three quick and big in the drill. I will blow the whistle, and the quarterbacks go 1, 2, 3, and throw to the right. When I say, "Throw to the right," they get the ball and bring it to the other hand. Then they reset and go again down the line. They throw and reset all the way across the field.

The sixth drill is one that we have been doing a great deal of lately. It is what we call our mental drops. I line the quarterbacks up in front of me, and they get on the hash mark. I will call the formation, the play, and the defensive coverage to them. Then I will say, "Sam runs to the flat." Then I blow the whistle. They take their drop, a quick five or a big five. Then they must throw the ball to the receiver they think will be open. The quarterback drops and goes through his reads mentally. I know who they are throwing to. If they screw up, I help them. This is way they are going to learn to throw the ball in a game. This is something you must do over and over.

Next, I want to go over our throwing drills. The first is what we call the release drill. We have two quarterbacks standing side by side. We have a wide receiver in front of the quarterback, but it could be a manager, another quarterback, or another player. The coach stands in front of the receivers. If we have an injured wide receiver who can take part in the drill, we will use them. The quarterback is in a set position. When the coach throws his hand up, the quarterback must release the ball to the receiver.
