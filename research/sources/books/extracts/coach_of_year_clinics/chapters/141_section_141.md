space where they can run straight upfield with it. When we get the defense spread out, we can run the football. That is why we have always had a 1000-yard rusher on our team. That is an overview of our offensive philosophy. That is kind of what we are about.

We are more comfortable in a 30-28 game than we are in a game that ends up 7-6. In all of the places that I have been, we have had to develop a mentality and a philosophy with our kids that did not destroy them when we gave up a touchdown. On defense we want to have 11 hats on the ball. That is really big for us. We run the pursuit drill endlessly. We will take speed over size. We will always take character over speed. We want 11 players who believe they can stop the opponent. You must have a philosophy for the entire game. In the SEC you are not going to play many 7-6 games. I did not coach in many of them at Iowa Wesleyan or Valdosta State. I was outnumbered at Copperas Cove, and I had to hope for the high-scoring games. We all have been on the sideline when we were involved in a tight game. When the opponents score a touchdown, you can just feel the wind go out of your team. The whole sideline is down. It has an effect on the offense and defense. We do not want that mentality. We want our offense to believe that we are going to score every time we have the football. Because of that, our defense can play as aggressively as they want. We want speed and aggressive football players.

Because we are a man-protection team and because we throw so much, we try to make all of our running game fit our pass protection. We can run the running plays that we use out of the two-point stance. That is where it starts. We want to create running lanes and throwing lanes. We have to be able to pass-block up front. Since we man-protect, we have to win the battle up front. When we have five of them who can win the battle up front, we have an offense. We work on this over and over in practice.

I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If you want to come to UK, remember, practice is open and our doors are open. It is a privilege to represent the commonwealth of Kentucky. Thank you very much.
