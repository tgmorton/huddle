us what the formation is. We had to know whether they ran the ball toward the tight end or split end. Everything we did was designed to stop the run. If they were a tight-end-running team, we blitzed the Mike linebacker through the B gap from a depth of about 2.5 to 3 yards. If he got action his way, he spilled everything outside, and the unblocked player to that side was the strong safety. Both safeties in the scarlet key are reading the tailback, so they are on the move with the tailback.

If the team is a split-end-running team, we bring the A gap player. In that case, the Buck linebacker comes through the A gap and spills everything to the safety moving with the tailback. The other linebacker was the cover linebacker, playing behind the hip of the blitzer, never overrunning the ball. Because the safeties were keyed to the tailback, you always had a player to spill the ball to. We could be super-aggressive.

We played the scarlet key on the strong and weak halfback sets with our safeties. The safety opposite the set back is the post player. The safety to the back took him in coverage or was a spill player for the blitz linebacker.

The other blitz came from a one-back set. In this set, since the Mike and Buck linebackers were both on the remaining back in our scarlet key, we called a ''flow dog." That meant that whichever way the back went was the linebacker who came. The other linebacker was the cover linebacker. It didn't matter where the wide receivers were.

Before I close, let me talk about the Ohio, 46, or Bear defense. I won't even put the corners in on this defense. Our free safety was our adjuster. This year when we run this defense, you will see him a little deeper. He is going to be 5 to 7 yards deep. The Willie linebacker and Leo are mirrored positions. They are coming off the edge against a straight I, aiming for the near hip of the fullback. If it is an offset I, they aim for the inside throat of the offset back.

The B gap players penetrate the line of scrimmage. We want them to key the ball, get their asses up in the air, and create some havoc in the backfield. They want to disrupt pulls and fold-blocking in the offensive line.

The noseguard is a backdoor player. He crowds and keys the ball. On the snap, he tries to drive his eyebrows through the center's throat. He tries to maintain inside leverage. If the center's helmet is trying to lead-block him, he tries to press him as deep into the backfield as possible and come off the back end of the center.

If we get all that done, we have two free football players plus a free safety in the hole. We call the adjuster that for a reason. He will handle all one-back breaks. He handles anything different in the formation. In a two-tight-ends and two-back set, he is the guy who walks up on the line of scrimmage. If they come up in a one-back set, the adjuster goes out and plays the coverage on the third receiver. The adjuster is a secondary player.

The Mike linebacker in the one-back set plays on the inside hip of the remaining back. He is a free football player on flow. There is no one who can get to the Mike linebacker, but he has the opposite A gap of the noseguard. If he gets flow, he is filling downhill. If the noseguard makes a mistake and gets across face on the center, the Mike linebacker may have to rock back and take the cutback.

The Willie and Leo coming off the edges have responsibility for bootleg and reverse. We tell them that if the tailback's shoulders are perpendicular to the line, there is no threat of cutback. They should slow down and check quarterback on the bootleg and split end on the reverse. If there is any threat of a cutback, they need to play that.
