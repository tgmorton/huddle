one. That is how you defend the pass. Those combinations depend on whether it is a vertical or horizontal pass route that you are facing.

In the four-man line, we drop the backers to the strong side. Now where does the offense have to come with the ball? They have to come to the strong-side flat.

Next, we will look at three deep, five shortstrong. We are going to set in a strong zone. The corners have the outside one thirds. The free safety comes to the deep middle. The strong safety takes the strong flat. We are going to attack the horizontal and vertical passing game. This is the defense that the NFL uses to harass teams that pass for the 5 yards. They use a three-man rush and play five short with three deep. This is very good to stop any horizontal pattern. On the other hand, we have three deep. Most teams would send the two wideouts on a deep route. The NFL defensive teams started using this defense to slow the two wideouts down. That enabled them to stop any receiver from going deep. This is the defense that changed the rules of the NFL.

THREE DEEP, FIVE SHORTSTRONG

When Green Bay got New England in long-yardage situations, they went to this package. The ran the twist stunt up front and shut them down. They had no place to throw the football. You can run the same scheme with the three linebackers, but it is not worth going over. It takes too much teaching to get the job done.

Next we go to our three deep, four short, with a spot defender. Remember when I talked about taking an area of the field away from the offense? What happened is this. Good offensive coordinators started lining up their good receivers in different positions. They would move them around. The 49ers did this with Rice. You have to come up with something that will combat this move. We came up with the spot defender. We want to do it in relation to the formation or the motion or what was going on at the time.

When I was at Maryland, we had to play against Herman Moore. They had a good offensive scheme. They moved him all around to get him open on the passes. You never knew where he was going to line up. We did not have anyone as fast as he was, and they still had a great horizontal passing game to the other receivers. This is where we used our spot defender. We would line up our spot where Herman would line up, ust as if we were in two deep. As soon as the motion started, the spot moved to the area outside the tight end at 12 yards. We moved the two corners back to the outside one thirds. The free safety came back and played deep middle. The four linebackers dropped off, and we played four short with a spot defender.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTSPOT DEFENDER

We had a choice to drop or blitz the strong inside linebacker. We would mix it up: drop him or blitz him. We still had the two tackles and nose to rush. Early in the game, this is what we would do. We would bring the strong safety to the spot. The corner would drop. The strong-side backer would drive to the outside. The
