Let me set the football schedule after school starts. I will talk about individual activities as we go through the schedule. Our first period is the seventh period at 2:30 P.M. when we have study hall or lift weights. That is where we have our lectures and films and weights. Then at 3:15 we tape and get dressed. Each schedule is set up like this.

As you can see, we have the varsity listed on the left side and the JVs on the right side. The next session is the special period. We have all of the punters, snappers, kickers, and return men. They report 15 minutes before practice starts. We have 30 minutes for our special period. A lot of people think that is a long time. It is important to us. We do not just give it lip service. It is important to us, so we work on it. We also use this period as an individual time for the non-kicking people.

Next is our Saber period. That session is for 15 minutes. Then we have our block A session for 20 minutes. We have three sessions on the A block. Then we switch blocks and work the same amount of time on block B. Next we have 15 minutes of conditioning, and it is pure hell. Then we finish with our postpractice. We also open the weight room for those who want to lift. Then the coaches have our meeting.

At the bottom of our practice schedule, we have several items that are helpful to our staff. We list the players that might be ineligible, injuries, players who did not dress that day or were absent or tardy, and other comments. Then we have opportunities listed. That is our punishment list, but we call it an opportunity list.

On the next sheet we have each activity listed in the practice. For example, we have everything listed that we plan to cover in our special teams session. Everyone is involved. Special team players are on one side of the field, and all others on the other side. They are working on individual work while the special team does their thing.

We do not do all of the kicking game in one day. We try to punt every day, at least one or two. We work on normal punts, pressure punts, kicking the ball into the end zone, and all other situations that we need to work on. We work on some phase of the kicking game every day, four days per week.

Our Saber period is this. It is my favorite period. I carry a horn in my pocket. I do not use a whistle. When I blow the horn, they know it is time for the next period. The Saber period is a walk-and-talk session with the entire offense on one side of the field and the defense on the other side. We use this on Saturday mornings and on Mondays. We go over mistakes and other things we are working on. It is a walk-and-talk session.

Next, we go to form tackling and block stations. We all talk about the game being a game of fundamentals, or blocking and tackling. We practice it every single day. We do blocking and tackling stations. We have forced them to do it. It may be hitting a sled or driving the sled, but we are going to do it.

The question is asked, How do we incorporate a player who plays both offense and defense?

In the block A period, we have the varsity working on offense and the JVs working on defense on the other side of the field. All of the varsity players are on the offensive field-all of them. The defensive starters are playing the scout team. We do not practice against a bunch of scrubs. We are running against our first defense. They are the scout team. They are getting some things done, but it may not be the exact things they would be doing on our defense. We will change it up and alternate players in and out.

We run nine-on-seven drills. Some of you may call it skeleton drills or combo drills. Only the first and second teams get reps, with 70 percent of the reps going to the first team and 30 percent to the second team. Everyone else must play on the scout team. We work our first receivers against our first DBs. The second-team quarterback will throw to his receivers against air.
