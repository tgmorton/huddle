In a Cover 8 the Will linebacker can go over the top and a safety fills in behind him. If flow comes to the safety they run the alley like crazy. The backside safety is keying the backside tackle through the near back. He is keying the tackle for direction and run or pass. He pats his feet and immediately goes vertical to replace the Will linebacker, if he reads run. He is the guy the offense cannot account for. He can react and tackle the play for a 3-yard gain.

The strong safety is called "BARON." On flow away from him he is replacing the Sam linebacker. If there is outside flow away from him, he reacts down the line at 8 yards depth, looking for the immediate cutback outside of the tackle. He helps fill in behind the playside safety.

If the number 2 receiver goes vertical, it becomes a matchup zone. The corners are aligned inside. They take the post away and force the fade.

Coaches, it's over. I'm out of time. I'll be here quite some time and I'll talk to you about anything we do. Good luck to you.
