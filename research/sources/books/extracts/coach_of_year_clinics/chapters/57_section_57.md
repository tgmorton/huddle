I studied the teams that we have had a hard time beating over the years. I found that the teams that give us the most trouble are the teams that play a tough, hard-nosed defense. They are playing man to man in the secondary. They blitz about half the time against you. They do enough to really confuse the offense. As a result of this, I encouraged our coaches at Skyline High to develop this type of defense. We are an attack man-to-man defense. We try to cause confusion for the offense by running a lot of stunts. We want to put pressure on the offense to keep it from getting momentum. It took a couple of years to sell this defense. Since we have been running the pressure defense, we have won three state championships in four years. Actually, we have won four championships in seven years. We have been in the state finals six of the last ten years.

I am not going to talk about our defense, but I think the reason we have had so much success is because we play an aggressive defense that keeps the offense off balance. If the offense can deal with the pressure, you may be in trouble, but most offenses do not deal with pressure very well.

We line up and stem our line and linebackers. We do not stem them together. The tackle or noseguard can do his own stemming. We have the line moving individually. Our linebackers do not stem a lot, but they are getting better at it. That has really helped us on defense.

One of the things that we stress to our kids is to try to determine whether the offense is going to run the ball or whether they are going to pass the ball from the stances of the offense. We spend a lot of time looking at film. We want to see if they give away the play when they are running a pass play, running play, trap play, or any special play. Sometimes you can tell when those big tackles rock back on their heels to pass block. You can tell when the weight is on his hand and his butt is up in the air and he is ready to go. We spend time with our kids trying to show them what to look for on this. We do not guarantee this, but we are about 90 percent accurate. When we think we have the play figured out, we make a call that alerts our linebackers and secondary and out line. If we think it is a run, we call our tank. If they are in a pass stance, we call out an airline, such as Delta, American, or whatever. If they are in a Delta stance, we let our secondary know. If one man is in a Delta stance and everyone else is in a tank stance, we look for the counter tray or trap play. This does not help you with every team. Some teams do a good job of disguising their offense. However, some teams tip their plays a great deal of the time.

We have evolved into a two-platoon system. We have only been doing this the last two years. You may give up some players on one side of the ball, but in the long run it will make you stronger. We get twice as much time to work with each group by running the twoplatoon system.

We do use a lot of different formations. We used to line people up exactly the same all of the time. Then we started moving them around within the formations and got some great results. We used to run the ace formation just as the Air Force Academy ran it. Now we have what we call a new ace formation that allows the two wide receivers to move to adjust their splits.

ACE FORMATION

After we ran the new ace formation, we decided to adjust some of the other formations. We started splitting people out and putting the backs on the hash marks. This changed things a lot.

NEW SPLIT FORMATION

Then we went to our trips set. We could run it to either side.
