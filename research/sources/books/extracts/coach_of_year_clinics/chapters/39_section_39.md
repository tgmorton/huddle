we want them to have some agility to avoid the rush. We are teaching them to keep their eyes open. When they move, the ball stays in the trigger position. When they take the five-step drop and they see the rush coming up the middle, they step to the side and throw the ball. You must be able to do that. If the rush comes from the other side, they must be able to avoid them and make the play. You can improvise on the drills. We have all kind of drills we use to teach them to evade the rush.

There is a lot to playing quarterback. I have 10 decision-making drills. We use these drills to help them make their decisions. I have four camps in Pennsylvania. We work the hell out of the kids that come to our camp. We charge them $35 for an eight-hour day. I saw in the newspaper where Kerry Collins paid Bill Walsh $40,000 to straighten out his release. Damn, I could have saved him a lot of money. I could have done it for 35 bucks. Let me tell you, there is a lot to being a quarterback. Thank you.
