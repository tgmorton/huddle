(a) You have to disguise. You don't want the quarterback to know what you are in before the ball is snapped. Make sure your pre-snap is not what you are going to be in after the ball is snapped.

(b) Timing is important to the blitzing team. You want to be able to hit the line of scrimmage on the run. If the quarterback sees you creeping, he will chicken out and get rid of the ball. Get the snap count to help with timing. Teams that use motion usually snap the ball at certain points in the motion. Get that from the scouting films. You can use that as a tip-off. Start your blitz when the motion is getting to the area where the ball is snapped.

(c) You have to collapse the pocket with inside heat. Buddy Ryan would fire you if he saw an inside pass rusher use a swim move. He wanted the gap ripped and the pocket collapsed.

(d) Speed pressure comes from the outside. If the quarterback can step up in the pocket, that is the place where he can escape. If there is no collapse of the pocket, the blitz breaks down. If the speed blitz comes from the inside gap, the ends better be containing.

(e) You have to take away the quick inside passing game. Force the offense to run outs and fades. Don't let them throw inside posts and curls.

We are a 4-3 football team, and we like to get into the eight-man force game. We are predominantly an over-and-under shifted team. If we are playing a shade technique on the center and a 3 technique away from the tight end, that is an under front. If we play a 3 technique to the tight end and a shade on the back side, that is an over front. The only way teams get us into a true 4-3 look is if they balance up.

Offensive coordinators who see a team that kicks the front one way or the other balance up to see if the defense will balance up. This game is not hard. Coaches make it hard. I guess we want to promote our intelligence. If the defense doesn't balance, the quarterback simply counts right and left and runs to the side with the least number of people on it. They use the "check with me" call. What we do is balance up and force you to run to a personnel mismatch rather than a numbers mismatch.

Ninety-nine percent of the time when we break the huddle at the Houston Oilers, I don't know what we are going to play. If I go back and coach at the high school level, I will run this package and system. I'll have to simplify it somewhat, but they can do exactly what we do. We have one of four calls in the huddle. Our game plan is the most important thing we do. We have a two-back formation page. It has every two-back formation known to man on it. We have terminology that describes our communication. The number 212 to us means two wide receivers, one tight end, and two backs. The first number is how many wide receivers, the second is how many tight ends, and the third is how many backs. Red means split backs. Flop is what Buddy Ryan called the slot set, and that stuck with us. Brown is a weak back tilt in the backfield. Brown-up is moving the weak back up into a tight slot position off the weak tackle. I-over is taking the fullback out of the I and offsetting him strong. I-under is moving the fullback the other way. If we moved the fullback up into the slot position, it was I-under flop or I-over flop. Blue is a strong back tilt, and blue-flop is moving him into the slot position. These are all the adjustments you can make with two backs in the backfield.

Across the top of our game-plan sheet we have AFC. That stands for automatic front and coverage. We have a computer system. I brought one of the charts we use. The one I brought is for the red set, or splitback look. On this sheet we have every run from this formation and the hole they run into. The passes are recorded at the top of the sheet. A split-back formation in our league is primarily a passing set, but they may run a little lead draw strong and weak.

This set is mainly a pass and not a lot of run. We play a seven-man front to it. We are going to take away your wide receivers and force you to beat us with your tight end or your backs. If you run to the open side, we are going to kick the front weak. If you like to run to the tight side, we kick the front strong. We have decided whether you run the opposite of the scouting report; we have won that down. The offense is doing something they really don't want to do. If an offense
