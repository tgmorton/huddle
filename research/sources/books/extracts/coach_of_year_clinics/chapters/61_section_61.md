Basic Defensive Alignment and Adjustments

Texas Tech University

I am proud to be here. Defense is sort of fun to talk about. Offense is not fun to talk about. If you coach offensive football, you have to be a genius. You have to remember all those rules. You have to learn what to do in every situation. That is assignment football. Assignment football is fine. You have to have it. But I'm glad we have someone else to coach it. Defense is reaction. You react to the ball and situation, and that is a whole lot more fun to coach.

I coached at a little school in Texas called Midland Lee High School. At Midland we had a good little old team. I had coached in a lot of high schools, and I got fired at a bunch of them. I was coaching at Midland and then had a chance to go to Texas Tech. I got a chance to be the defensive coordinator. I don't know why I did it. We had just lost in the state championships. After you lose a game, you are sort of crazy anyway. The dog doesn't like you. Your wife doesn't like you. Nobody likes you.

The guy from Texas Tech called me and asked me to take the job. I told him I would. I told him, "A lot has happened since last week when I turned down the job." I took the job and went up there. I was the defensive coordinator. I could bring any of my coaches with me that I wanted. "It's your defensedo anything you want to." I told him it was going to be a high school defense. He said he didn't care, just come.

I went up there, and we did pretty good. We had some pretty good defensive players. We did good enough that the head coach got fired. I was getting ready to go to the next school when they hired David McWilliams. He and I had coached together for five years at the University of Texas. I stayed on and later became the head coach after David left. He went to the University of Texas, and they hired me.

The moral of the story was that I really liked what we were doing on defense. We ran a 4-3 defense. It was the old Bum Phillips defense that we had run before. It was amusing; we ran a high school defense the first year I was the defensive coordinator at Tech, and we led the nation in pass defense. That just proves statistics don't mean much. Nobody had to pass. They just ran the football up and down the field on us.

I became the head coach at Texas Tech and my secondary coach, Coach Carlos Slaytor, became my defensive coordinator. We hired a couple of pro guys who were out of a job, and, boy, were they smart. They had all the answers. They started talking to old Carlos, and the next thing I know, we are running a 3-4 defense. We started doing things I had never heard of. We had guys in the press box watching everything. The defense was so complicated, it was a mystery. People roared up and down the field on us. The players weren't any good either. That had a lot to do with it. They were terrible.

The Chicago Bears called and wanted old Carlos to come up there and coach. He went. I started looking around for a defensive coordinator. I came to the conclusion that I would be the defensive coordinator. I used to have more fun doing that than anything else. I hadn't been having any fun being the head coach. As the head coach, all I did was walk around with a clip board. Being a head coach is overrated. There ain't much to do. All they want you to do is get out of the way. I tried to look like I knew what I was doing.

Well, I took the defense, and we put in a new scheme in the spring. We had more fun that spring than we had in years.

The second year that I coached, I coached at Ballinger High School. That is my hometown. There were 3112 people who lived there. There's not that many there anymore. We were a AA school with two coaches. Bob Wright and I were the only coaches. Bob loved offense. He coached the offense, and I was the line coach. When we went to defense, he told me that he was
