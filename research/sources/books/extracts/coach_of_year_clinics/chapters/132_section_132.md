If the end attacks the mesh, the quarterback snaps the ball off at the elbow of the running back and tucks the ball under the chin. Now the quarterback is going to turn up the alley. He wants to run for a first down.

We used to teach the pitch with the thumbs down. We now teach the basketball pitch. It is a little thing, but if I get hit as I make the pitch in a basketball fashion, the ball goes up in the air. We have a chance to catch the pitch if it is in the air. If the ball is pitched with the thumb down, the ball is likely to go on the ground, and that is difficult to handle.

Those were finesse plays. If we want to run a power play, we can run what we call the same play with zing motion. We want to make sure we secure the linebacker or the B gap. We are still going to read the same man, but this gives us power at the point of attack.

36 OUTSIDE VEERZING MOTION

If we want to hand the ball to the lead back, it becomes an I formation iso play. Now the blocking back is up at the line of scrimmage, and my tailback is only four and one-half yards deep. We can move the Z back in motion, so we can pick up the linebacker in the C or B gap. If we want to give the ball to the wingback we call it 08.

08FAKE DIVE, ZING MOTION

If the defense sees the wideout coming in motion, they think it is the lead play again. This time we fake the dive and give the ball to the wingback. These are old wing-T sweep principles.

We are only pulling one guard instead of two, because the front-side guard has to block down or he is covered on the goal line. We want to go inside or outside. We are going to go where the defense is not. We tell our down defender to read the defense and replace him. Don't run away from him; replace him.

While the video is warming up, I want to leave you with this thought. This is something we teach the kids. Earl Nightingale said, "You are what you think about." I think he got it from Emerson, to tell you the truth. We added this to the quote: "You are what you think about and act upon!" It is important that we tell our kids that if they want to be a good athletes and students, they must do the things that will allow them to be successful in that particular area.

My time is up. I will be glad to spend time with you if you want. Thank you.
