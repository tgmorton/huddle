Setting the Offensive Practice Schedule

Troy State University

When Ray Lamb called me to speak, I told him I had four types of lectures. I told him I had a one hundred dollar, two hundred dollar, five hundred dollar, and one thousand dollar lecture that I could give. I asked him which one he want me to use. He said, "Wayne, I want you to lecture 
free." 
I said, "No way." But I am glad to be here.

For those who do not know much about Troy State, let me bring you up to date. We are located in south Alabama. We are a Division I AA football team. We are a member of the Southland Football League. We are about one hour below Auburn. We are about two hours from the beach. We have been pretty successful for the last six years. I work for Larry Blakeney, who was an assistant at Auburn for 13 years. We have put together a good program. Not only is it a good place to go to school and to get an education, but it is a place where we feel we can win some football games.

Today I want to go over what we do with our offense. First, I want to talk about our practice schedule. At a lot of the clinics you go to, they talk a lot of X's and O's. Everyone has a different idea. When I go to speak at a clinic, I try to give the coaches something that will give them some different ideas and things to think about.

The thing we try to do is to get in as many reps as we can in the time we have allotted for practice. A lot of coaches will talk about quality reps. Yes, you do want quality reps. However, getting kids lined up and getting them moving is very important. I go to a lot of high school and college practices, and I see five players working and 50 players standing around watching. What we try to do is to get everyone moving at a rapid pace. We want to create in practice the situation the players face in the game. I am sure everyone wants to do this.

We start off with running fundamentals. We do those 10 to 15 minutes per day. Next, we go to the chute-and-sled drills. We do a board drill as well. I have all of our fundamental drills on a tape. If you want to see it, I can get it to you.

We do half-line runs for 10 to 15 minutes per day. Most of you have only one offensive line coach. If you have two line coaches, that is a good situation. We work on the plays that we need to work on for that day as we go through the drill. We go "no-huddle rapid fire" on the left side, and then we do it on the right side. Then we swap sides between the 1s and 2s on offense and defense. This is with a quarterback and no backs. I find myself spending more time coaching the scout team than I do at times on our kids. It is important to get the look you want from the scout team. We are in the "no huddle with rapid fire" and then "no backs."

Everything is scripted for the drill. I have another man running the defense, and I have the 1s and 2s. Everything is filmed. If I see something wrong, I will correct it. We run a play and then bring the second group up on the line and run the play. This is rapid fire. We want as many reps as we can get. We are teaching on film rather than spending the time on the field. At the same time there are a few little things that you have to do, but you want to get as many reps as possible.

Next, we go full-line runs with our backs against the scout team. We go best against best early in the year. We do not do this much. We do not want anyone to get hurt. We want to be able to use them on Saturday. We do just enough early in the year to get their pencils sharpened. We will do four reps with the first group and four reps with the second group. Then we repeat the four reps with each group. After that we go two reps with each group. They end up getting 10 snaps each, best against the best and seconds against the seconds.
