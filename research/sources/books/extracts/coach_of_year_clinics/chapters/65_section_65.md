whether it is pass or run every time before the ball is snapped. The quarterback may lick his fingers when he is going to throw. The left guard may tip when he is going to pull, pass block, or run block. Somebody on that line will tell us, and we communicate it to the others.

This is really a big word in our scheme, but it is important. If the offense runs a sweep to the outside, we tell the safety, who is lined up in the middle of the formation, to attack the line of scrimmage where he fits. That means don't run into some responsibility blind. If the contain gets knocked down and the ball is not being turned inside, don't fill inside. Go to where you fit. Have enough sense to know what the defense is all about. Make your pursuit fit the play.

Our cover one is our man free coverage. If you want to cut your teaching down, go to this numbering system. I heard Wade Phillips talk about this about 10 years ago. We number the receiver from the strong side to the weak side. The wide receiver to the strong side is 1, the tight end is 2, the fullback is 3, the tailback is 4, and the wide receiver to the weak side is 5. If 3 and 4 are in the I formation, whichever receiver comes weak is 4 and the one that goes strong is 3. In our man free coverage, the strong corner has 1, the Sam linebacker has 2, the Mike linebacker has 3, the Raider has 4, and the weak corner has 5. The Will linebacker and safety are free. We can blitz him or leave him as a hole player. He could take the coverage on 3 and let the Mike linebacker blitz.

We can call "1-key weak bracket." That means we double both wide receivers. The weak corner and Raider take 5 in some kind of combination man. They play him in and out or short and deep. The strong corner and safety take 1 in the same scheme. The Sam linebacker takes 2, and the Mike and Will linebacker take 3 and 4.

We can call "1 cloud." The corners roll up and beat the hell out of the wide receivers. The Raider and safety play behind the corners and protect deep. The linebackers pick up their people as they did in the double. If the receiver tries to come out and cross, the linebackers wall them off and combo them in and out. The Will linebacker takes the back who runs outside, and the Mike linebacker takes the back who comes inside.

We also play cover three. Cover three is our three-deep zone. The Sam linebacker and Raider are the curl to flat players. The Mike and Will linebackers are hook to curl players.

The corners and safety play thirds. The funny thing about this is we play cover three about 15 percent of
