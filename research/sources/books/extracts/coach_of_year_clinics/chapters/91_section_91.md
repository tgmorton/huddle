8. Hands go to target point; play side number. Hands above eyes; press and then slide; escape. Get off the block.

9. Target drill: Shuffle, right, left, step, hands, slide. Eyes are even or below the hands.

10. You may use the sled, but it is best body on body.

11. Use offensive lineman against defensive man. Don't use a snap count. Go on movement. You may have to go half-line if you do not have enough personnel.

12. Work against reach block: drive offensive man back; punch and press.

13. Work on press and squeeze: Get hands on them, punch-press, attack, then read. Don't turn shoulders. Anytime you get a down block, squeeze it. Don't get upfield; trap; use opposite arm.

14. On center fills to backside guard, punch center; drive him back; don't turn; keep shoulders square. If a person ever reaches you, get down the line of scrimmage.

15. On double team, step and punch; get shoulder down; turn to double team. Split double team.

16. In a 4 defense, you have to read the guard.

Now I want to get into the fronts. This is how we number our fronts. We line up in a 1 shade, 2 shade, or a 3 shade. We line up eye to eye on the offensive man. We number the offensive linemen from his right to his left. In a 1 shade, you are right eye to right eye. In a 3 shade, you are left eye to left eye.

We will always stunt from a 2 call unless it is a red call. The 
red
 means
that we will be in a certain type of defense for the offensive set that you are using.

The first number tells us our alignment as far as the type of defense. The next number is always for the line. The third number is for the secondary. If we end the call in a 1, it is man-to-man coverage. If we end the call in 2, we are going to play halves. If we end the call in 3, we are going to play zone coverage. We have tried to keep this simple for our defense. We do not number all of the offensive linemen with techniques as some people do on defense. We use the KISS principle. This is a 533 call. We can call 533, 532, or 531. We all play the 3 technique on the line.

This is a 523 call. All down linemen play the 2 alignment. We can call 523, 522, or 521.

This is our 513 call. All the down linemen play the 1 alignment. We can call 513, 512, or 511.

We call 523 slant right. Now all 3 down linemen line up in a 3 alignment and slant to our right.

The line should back off about six to eight inches to help on slants. We try to avoid contact from the offensive linemen. We want to break the line of scrimmage and find the ball. We try to rip the opposite arm under to the slant side.

We like to slant to the short side of formations. Anytime we are doing any stunting, we like to line up n a 2 technique. We do not want to get whipped. We want to make sure we have an equal chance to get to
