gear, then the second gear, the third gear, and the fourth gear, and then we go to overdrive. Once they learn to do that drill sitting down, we stand up and do the drill. We may stand behind them, have them put their hands out, and have them touch the elbows to the hands. That is all we do on arm drills.

We have skips, butt kicks, slide kicks. Next we do backward skips. It is for rhythm purposes. The way we teach it is just as if you had just shot a free throw in basketball and you are lazy getting back on defense. You just back-skip. They can learn that very fast.

Now we tell them to get their heel up to their butt, get the hand behind them, and reach back. That is all of our anterior-posterior back stuff.

Then we do our side stuff. This includes shuffle, carioca, and the high-knee carioca by getting it up and over. You can't be low when you do this. You must be tall. We are working on getting the hip and back loose. That is what we do in our warm-up. We do these on Mondays and Wednesdays after we go outside. We work on sprint skill drills. It kind of fades out on Mondays, because of time and because they get bored with it, but we do it every Wednesday. They get bored again on Wednesday, but we still do it, though we may do it one leg at a time. We tell them to skip with the left leg only. Then we go on the right leg only. Then we do the butt kick right leg only, slide kick left leg only, skip backward left leg only. When you get your linemen to where they can do that, they can move.

Another thing we do is to get on a hill. We will kick-step up the hill. We go up the hill diagonally or straight back and power-step down the hill. We are doing the same things you have to do on a football field with resistance, but we are doing it on a hill.

That is an idea of some of the sprint and skill drills we do in warm-up. Agility drills are agility drills. I was talking with the Nebraska people. Do you know how far their offensive linemen run in agilities, conditioning, and sprint work? Everything is at 40 yards. From the time a freshman gets to Nebraska until the time he leaves as a senior, the longest run he will have is 40 yards. I am sure that in football practice they do some other things that are longer than the 40 yards on the field, but in the off-season and the rest of the time with the strength coaches, it is the 40 yards. How can they be so good? They spend two years of lifting, running, and eating before they can ever play. This is true with most of their players. It must be nice to have that situation. Most of us are not that fortunate. Some of our players are a year out of high school, and they have to play. Next year when we come to Michigan, we will have to put three pairs of pants on some of them so you will not be able to see the stains on TV.

On Friday when we go to fitness, we try to unload the body. We do a lot of reps, but with a light load. We do a lot of squat-jump work. Also, we do a lot of circuit work. We will do 110s, and we do the steps.

As our running goes through the week, we will do 50s on Monday. We run across the field, then walk 20 yards. I do it that way because you do not have to worry about discipline because they are always moving.

On Tuesday we do stance and starts. We run straight ahead and laterally. The key on stance and starts is this. They had the Burns Seminar in Dallas a few weeks ago. Vern Burns is the person who taught me the theory on positive shin angle, and we have adopted it. If I am going to run a 40-yard sprint, this is how Burns would teach it. You can take any kid who runs a 40, and if he starts in a football stance, I tell him this: In one hour, I can knock one tenth off his time. Usually it takes about 15 minutes. If I am a personal trainer, it is easy to do. ''Ready, go. You ran a 5.2. Let's go again. Ready, go. You ran a 5.1. Pay me." Electronically, and here is how. If I get into a football stance and I take my first step, the clock is running. If one tenth has gone by, I still have 40 yards to go. I have taken the first step as I am supposed to do, but in the football stance, I still have 40 yards to go. We teach the bunch start. If you are a small player, it is easy. If you are tall player, you have to drop off the line about six inches. We do stance and starts every Tuesday. We do 12 to 16 of them. We just wear them out with it. How do you get better? By reps.
