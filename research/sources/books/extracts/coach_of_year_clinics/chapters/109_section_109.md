want the end out wide in a sprinter's stance. I ask our end to get to three yards right behind the offensive tackle. We can run by the tackle for that four-yard stretch. We can beat the tackle to that point. If we can beat them on the speed rush, we can get to the quarterback. That is the speed rush. Use your speed to beat the blocker.

Next, we talk about attacking one half of the man. If the tackle gets to the spot and we get tied up with him, we want to be able to beat him. Once the blocker gets his shoulders turned, you have something you can work with. We work on the outside half of the man. What I am talking about is basically a rip move. [Demo] We step with the outside foot, rip with the inside arm, step through the man, and go get the quarterback.

The next move we talk about is the swim move. Now, I bring the arm up and bring the elbow up inside. This will clear you, and you can get to the quarterback. [Demo]

We have the tackle so concerned because we have beaten him to the outside. Next, we want to get to the bull-rush move. We get our face mask into the man and drive him back into the quarterback. The feet never stop moving. I want them to perfect their moves and be able to use their best move in a game.

The next move is the spin move. As we make contact, we want to take the inside foot and step up and then spin. As we spin, we want to make sure that we are by the man. If you don't, he can step back inside and pick you up. The spin move and countermoves have been good for us.

I will go over three pass-rush stunts with you. We do not do a lot of different stunts on the pass rush. First is what we call the Texas stunt. The tackles penetrate first, stepping inside and then slanting outside into the face of the offensive man. The ends are going to come down inside. They come off the inside hip of the tackles. This should free him up to the quarterback.

PASS RUSHTEXAS

On the Ex stunt the ends go first, and the tackles come outside off the hips of the ends.

PASS RUSHEX

The stunt that was very effective for us was what we called Taco. We have a Texas on the call side, and we have an Ex on the split side. This is good against man protection. We have an end in the A gap and one in the B gap.

PASS RUSHTACO

That is all of our pass-rush stunts. Most of our sacks came off the base rush. I want to put on our game film so you can see what I have talked about. Thanks.
