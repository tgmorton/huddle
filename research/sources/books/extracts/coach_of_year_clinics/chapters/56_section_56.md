assistant at Michigan before he went to Arizona as head coach. If you can get any of his motivational tapes, you would get a lot out of them. He was a real coach. In Ohio he won something like 55 straight games.

Fisher DeBerry is another great name. We run an offense similar to the Air Force in some aspects. He has been so helpful to me in everything that I know about the option offense. I was an assistant coach for seven years and then the head coach at Highlands before going to Skyline High School.

The year 1982 was the turning point in my career, when I saw Air Force come in to play BYU. They beat BYU. Ken Hatfield was the head coach at Air Force at the time. Coach DeBerry was an assistant. They got me to start thinking about the problems with our passing game. Our quarterback had messed up throwing the ball, and we had some real problems. Our players did not seem to be as big as the other team. I decided to study the Air Force offense. That winter, I took an assistant coach with me, and we went to visit the Air Force Academy. Coach DeBerry was very nice to me, helping me with the offense. We came back and put it in our offense, and I have loved it ever since. It is a perfect offense for high school. You can always find someone that can run the ball. It is so team oriented. We still go back to the Air Force Academy and visit. They have some of the best teachers in the county.

At Skyline High we have mottoes. In 1993 our motto was "one heartbeat." Our captain would get in the huddle and yell "one." The entire team would respond "heartbeat." This was a great motivational tool.

The next year I wanted to keep the same motto. In 1993 we went 13-0 and won the state championship. Why change? The captains wanted to change it. We got to the semifinals but did not win the state.

In 19951 decided that we did need a new motto. I saw Coach Lombardi when he was coaching in northern California. He talked about his motto. He would yell out, "You gotta." The team would respond with "believe." I really liked that. We used that motto and felt we would keep it forever. We won the state championship again.

In 1996 I decided we would get a new team motto, but we would also keep the other one. We did the double logo that Texas Tech has. Our motto was "Teamtogether." When they were in the huddle, the captain would say, "Team." The team would say, "Together." As the season went on and we approached the playoff, another motto developed. We had a couple of team members who just could not focus. We adopted the motto ''Focus and finish." Marty Schottenheimer uses this in some of his talks, so we stressed to the team that they had to "focus and finish.''

We elect two new captains in December. I like doing this because that helps share the responsibility of getting the team ready to go next year.

In one of the 
Coach of the Year Clinic Manuals 
I read that a team selected team leaders, so we have done that recently. We just elected seven team leaders. We have two captains and seven team leaders. We are going to have an NFL draft-type program.

We are going to have those nine players select the rest of the squad and put them on their squad. Now if we need to contact the team or give something to the kids, we can go to the captains and leaders, and it goes right down the line to the rest of the squad. Now we have nine players that can monitor the program to see how everyone is doing. In the summer we will select one of the seven leaders as a third captain. We will have three captains and six leaders during the season. During the season we have one honorary captain, so for each game we really end up with four captains. That captain can be anyone on the team. It has been really helpful for us.

When we first came to Skyline, we had to put together a staff. We have been together for 11 years now. We have outstanding coaches. They set a good example, and they are leaders. They are good teachers and good coaches.
