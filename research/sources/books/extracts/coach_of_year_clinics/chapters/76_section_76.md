in our staff meeting late into the night. One day I went home and had no more laid down when the phone rang. I have a little dog named Patty Murphy. The phone call was from my neighbor Mrs. Scott. She said, "Coach, your dog Patty Murphy is over here on top of my little dog Pepi. "Pepi was her show dog. She had the dog registered and had all of the papers to prove her pedigree. She did not want my dog having sex with her dog. I said, "Mrs. Scott, just grab Patty Murphy by his tail and pull him off of Pepi. You know Patty Murphy. He will not hurt you." She replied, "I just tried that, and it does not work." I said, "Why don't you grab a bucket of water and throw it on the dogs. That will work.'' She said, "I just tried that, and it doesn't work.'' I said, "OK, I know what to do. Mrs. Scott, take the telephone over and set it next to the dogs. Hang up the phone, and I will call you back. Let the phone ring three or four times." She said, "Will that work?" I replied, "I don't know for sure, but it just worked at my house."

When you win, you get a lot of things going for you. They raised our recruiting budget after we won the championship. Now we have the third highest budget in the state. The University of Colorado is first, Mullen High School is the second, and now we are the third highest. I am hoping we will pass Mullen High up soon. Mullen did a good job this year, so I can joke with them.

I want to share a couple of things with you. Most everyone knows where we are and what we are doing. We have about 10,000 students. The best-known person from our school is James Michener, the Pulitzer Prize author. He is still alive. Those of you who have been on campus know that Michener Library is named in his honor. He wrote 
Centennial.

We have a great school. This is my 10th year at the University of Northern Colorado. I flat love the school. Greeley, Colorado, is a great town. We are the summer home of the Denver Broncos. If you have not done so, you should get up there and check them out. They have been very gracious toward coaches. It is a lot of fun to visit with them. We built a new stadium two years ago. We are 13-0 in our new facility.

I am not going to tell you that we have reinvented the wheel. The best thing I have done is to hire good people. I learned this at a young age. This is true if you are hanging out, playing games, or coaching. Get yourself good people. I have a great staff. They are getting the job done for us. We have about 14 other coaches on our staff. I have not coached a position in the last several years. I have been fortunate to move around to each group. I have delegated a lot of things to my staff. I have been very fortunate that the guys have carried it out. It has allowed me to do a lot of other things. I focus a lot of my time on recruiting and fund-raising, and I get very involved in the motivational part of it. I love working with our coaching staff.

Talking about our offense, philosophically we want balance. A lot of you remember the old UNC that could win the league passing every year. Those teams took a lot of pride in the passing game. I think that is a great way to move the football. Now, the passing game only does not wash in our conference. In the WAC that philosophy works. They have a track meet in about every game. In our league it is just about a fistfight every week. Even though we were national champions, we still lost three games in our conference. There are 10 teams in our conference. I like to think of our conference as the Big Ten of Division II. If you can power your way through the conference and make the final 16 tournament, you should have an excellent chance to still be standing when the tournament is over. Our league definitely prepared us for the national championship. We had a lot of injuries, but we made it through the year.

We really feel we must have balance in our offense. We work really hard at running the football. We are still a two-back attack. This has been my philosophy ever since I played back in 1959. I am a big-time fan of Bob Devaney of Nebraska. He was the coach who came to Lincoln when I was about 12 years old. He got Nebraska off the ground, and he did it by first playing good defense and then by running the football.

By running the football, you learn to be tough. Your defense learns how to stop the run by working against your offense each day. I am not going to say that we hammer the eight-man front all day. We feel we work harder than most teams. We keep two backs in the game most of the time. We are a two-back attack
