7. One final note about how you approach an opponent on the week of practice and the game. Be careful when prejudging an opponent. When Lou Holtz talked about an opponent prior to the game, he would pump them up and make them greater than they actually were. You have to be careful with high school kids when you do that. While we never want to underestimate an opponent, it can be equally wrong to overestimate them. By doing so, we concede certain things that they have not earned. We tell them we are going to prepare for the game.

We tell them that we must believe that we are going to win the game. It is not how badly you are going to win, but we are confident, we have prepared, and we have tried our best in practice. We are united as a team, we came here to win, and that is what we want to do. If you lose, you know that you tried your best. When you leave, you never hang your head.

Let me cover our coaches organization and how we divide the responsibilities in our program.

Here is our three-a-day practice schedule. We do not give them time to do crap. It is a warrior mentality. If you come to our three-a-days, it means you have given up the summer and the good times to work on football. We do not have sleep-overs. We do not have the facilities to stay overnight. They have to get there early. This is how our day goes.

THREE-A-DAY PRACTICE SCHEDULE

7:30-8:00-Breakfast/clean-up

8:00-8:30-Prepractice: Bring out cones, bags, balls, etc.

8:30-11:30-Practice no. 1

11:30-12:00-Change/get ready for lunch

12:00-1:00-Lunch/clean-up

1:00-1:30-Free time (coaches meet)

1:30-2:15-Practice no. 2: Offense lift; defense on field

When our guys go home, they are dead tired. They go home and go to bed. They know they have to be back early. That is a typical three-a-day practice schedule.
