(2) Get off blocks. I do not care what position you play, you must be able to get off the blocks. We use a drill we call "get off the block." We do the drill with bags.

(3) You need to learn to run to the football to have a great defense. We use a burst drill, a pursuit drill, and a pride drill to teach players to get to the ball.

(4) Good tackling is a must to have a good defense. We use a lot of drills on this. We run these drills with them: hit and fit, one man, Burma, open field, scramble, and eye opener.

Let me go over one or two more points before we get out of here. First is punt for points. We have had the All-State punter for the last two years. We have had the All-State punter more than our share.

We do this drill at the end of practice. We may have enough players for four or five teams. You divide the players into teams. We are looking for three things on the punt-for-points drill. We want to work on punt coverage, communication, and conditioning. We line up in punt formation and go down and cover the punt. You can put the ball on the 50-yard line or whatever yard line you feel your punter can reach. The punt is made, and the team covers the kick. If the ball lands between the 15- and 10-yard lines, you get one point. If it lands between the 5- and 10-yard lines, you get two points. If it lands between the goal line and 5-yard line, you get three points. If the ball goes in the end zone, you do not get a point. If you want, you can double the points for kicking the ball out of bounds near the end zone. You set a goal for the number of points you want them to reach. If the goal is seven points, when a team gets seven points, they can drop out and watch the other groups. There are a lot of variations you can use with the drill.

The last point is what we call extra-point reduction. We may tell the team we are going to run 30- to 40-yard sprints after practice, but we will go for the extra-point reduction. We have two kickers and a guest kicker. We line up with our two regular kickers. We line up with no referees and no defense, and we are kicking the PATs. We let them kick, and if they make them, we reduce the number of sprints they have to run. We keep moving them back after they make a kick. We are putting the kickers under pressure. We will do some bag rushing, but we are going against air here. Some days we may not run many sprints, and some days we may run a lot of them. This encourages team spirit. They really cheer for those kickers. We may have to adjust the number of sprints they run, but it is fun.

I hope I have given you some ideas. Thank you.
