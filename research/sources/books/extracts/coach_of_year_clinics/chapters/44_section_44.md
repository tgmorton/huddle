to be creative and talk about what they want to. It is a great motivational tool.

In August every coach on the staff will give a clinic to the rest of the staff in our first meeting. I don't care how long we have been together as a staff. This is an old Michigan tradition. Hal Hunter is our offensive line coach. He will deliver a clinic to the staff as if he were talking to his players. He has 60 minutes to show everyone on that staff what he is going to show his position group. During that 60 minutes he will show us his training video. Every teacher has a different teaching method. That is all coaching is. Our coaches expose the methods they use to the rest of the staff. They can learn from each other different methods of teaching. When a guy joins your staff, it sets a standard for him. If I have a new guy on my staff, I never let him go first. We usually make him go last. These are grown men, professionals. After eight of those assistant coaches have gone and it becomes the new guy's time, he is puckered. He wants to do a good job. He wants to be a head coach, just like those other guys. There is pressure, but it is a great experience. When was the last time you hired a coach and didn't hear him teach? We do it all the time. We have no idea what he is telling those players. I get around now since I don't coach a position. I can tell whether a guy is doing a good job or not. I can tell if he is honest with them, whether they are listening, and if he is going too long.

I have a senior barbecue at my house for our seniors. This is a leadership clinic for them. I want to talk to them about how they see their leadership roles on the team.

The last game I coached at Vandy we lost 55-0. The reason I got the LSU job was no one else would take it. It got late, and they had to give it to somebody. Six days before we played Texas A&M in 1995, we were going to practice on Sunday. Outside our locker room I saw this kid standing on the back of a pickup truck, and everyone else was standing around listening to him. I knew I had a problem. I called a team meeting and put up the practice schedule, which included a goal-line scrimmage because we weren't very good at it. They didn't think a scrimmage six days before a game was a good idea. They hadn't got to know me. At the end of the meeting, I asked if there were any questions. The captain stood up and told me they were not going to practice. They said I was working them too hard. I told them that this was LSU property. If they didn't want to practice, they could get the hell out of my room. They stayed, and we went out to practice. We had a very average practice. That night the captain was in my office. He is a great kid who is playing pro ball now. He told me he didn't agree with the demands, but he thought it was his job to represent their wishes. I told him that was not leadership. Leadership is not counting hands to see who wants to practice easy.

I teach a leadership class. I have 11 guys in it. I bring in other students, legislators, pro coaches, and others into the class to explain their definition of leadership. I don't keep them much longer than 40 minutes. The one thing I stress is, however you start out to lead, that is the way you finish. If you start out as a rah-rah guy on the first day, I better hear from you at midseason. Don't think you can change. Don't think when things go bad you can disappear. Give a guy a chance to not be a holler guy if he doesn't want to holler. Tell the rah-rah guy that if that is his style, that will be his style all year.

I give my kids a handout with typical problems. These are the things I want to discuss. Night activity is a dangerous time for athletes. I don't know where you went to college, but where I went, Thursday night was "get drunk night." If you get drunk two nights before you play Alabama, you will get your ass kicked. That is pretty simple. I'm not going to the bars to throw you out. Who is going to keep everyone out of the bars? Seniors have to make a decision about whether we are going out or not. They need to hold the rest of the team accountable. I make them tell me what they decided.

I don't believe in hazing of the freshmen. We are all one team, and there is no place for that type of thinking. The hazing has a tendency to separate and divide the team concept. I don't allow it to go on in our program.

I never liked the idea of game captains. That is the way it was done before. We have a lot of Louisiana guys on our squad. It has been an incredible honor to play in Tiger Stadium. But it was a bigger honor to serve as
