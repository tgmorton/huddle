the defender on his hip pocket, and he keeps coming on across. If he sees the zone, he will just hook up. We do not want to leave an area where we are open just to find another open spot. This is very easy to do, as long as you do not have a lot of people doing it. You do not need two or three players adjusting the routes all of the time. We feel that with combination coverage that we get with all of the different reads we see, we need someone working some type of man-zone read all of the time. It may be the receiver in the middle; it may be the running back or a lot of other people.

I do not think it makes any difference what we call these plays, because I do not have time to go over our numbering system except to tell you this. Our first digit is to the single-receiver side on the weak side. Our second digit is the middle receiver, and the third digit is for the strong-side receiver. We add a word for flare control to both sides. The first thing we say in our system is the protection. The reason we do thisregardless of the formation we are in or the grouping we have, as we could have two, three, or four wide receiversis because it gives us a multiple offense. All the receiver needs to know is whether he is the first, second, or third number and the flare control word.

I am going to cover a basic route that anyone here could run, regardless of the type of formation you base out of. What we are doing here is giving the outside receivers the ability to convert their routes. If we face some type of soft zone coverage, we are going to run a five-step hitch-type route. We use three-step protection with the quarterback. He is going to know that he has the inside people taken care of if they have underneath coverage on the outside men. It is obvious that if the corner comes up and plays bump and run on the outside receiver, he will convert his route to the fade route. I know you got to see Florida play a lot this year. Danny Wuerffel was the best I have seen at throwing the fade route. They had great receivers and a large number of completions on that play. Everyone played the receivers, hoping that Danny was going to have a bad day. He only had one bad day, and that was when Florida State sacked him so much.

The fade route is tough to complete. All things must go well for the play to work. You can have the perfect pass and have the defensive back knock it down. As our quarterback comes out of the huddle, the first thing he does is to figure out to which side he has the least amount of coverage.

The quarterback reads and works the strong side primarily. If you get straight man, the "80" will have a run-through, and the outside routes will convert to fade routes.

We would like to throw the hitch route here if we can. If we feel we have a mismatch on the outside and they are playing bump and run, then we will throw the fade route. The idea is this: If we are in the plus-20 area, we have a chance to have a completion, avoid the sack, and make some yardage.

Usually when we run this play, it will be packaged with some type of run play. Most of you are familiar with the outside zone play. Some of you may call it the stretch play. Because we are in the one-back set, we may call "check slant or quick pass." If the defense walks up tight on the receivers, plays tight, and plays cover two, we may check off and run the slant play. We may just run the draw play. If they take the linebacker outside, we may run the draw. It depends on the basic philosophy, front-wise.

Most of the coaches here are knowledgeable. It does not make any difference if you are knowledgeable or not, the bottom line is win or lose. This is what you have to do. Coaches will say that they can only run one snap count, and we can't check plays off. Basically, that is what you do not want to do. If you
