an influence on his throwing motion. I've heard a lot of people talk about quarterback mechanics. They talk about pointing the knees and other things. That is confusing to me. I really believe there are only five things important in throwing the ball.

When you are teaching a kid how to throw, make sure he gets his elbow shoulder high. The best explanation I've ever heard in throwing the ball is as the quarterback starts to throw, he should expose his number to the target. When he throws, he should pronate the hand so that the thumb snaps down and inside.

Make sure he does not overstride. The final thing is to never throw across your body. If he exposes his numbers, it takes care of throwing across the body. He should never let the ball cross his face. That is a way of saying "Don't throw across your body."

The first play we work on is called "69." The set I'll put up here is a pro set with split backs. The split end does a takeoff. The tight end releases upfield to a depth of 7 yards and crosses to a depth of 15 yards. The flanker runs an 18-yard square-in and comes across the field. He can also run a post and then square it in or run a post-corner if he sees the corner is jumping the in route. If we want to run that option, we call "69 Z post-corner."

The linemen block big on big. The center blocks weak. The tailback and fullback have the outside backers. If they come, they block them. If the linebackers drop, they release into the flat.

We have man and zone routes. If you are playing against a zone team, make sure you create a horizontal and vertical stretch. If it is a man route, we use crossing routes or individual cuts.

If you tell your receivers to run a 12-yard curl, they will run it at 9 to 10 yards. We have to stay on our receivers all the time to get the proper depth from our patterns. The defense playing a zone wants to force the offense in. They want to compress the zone and force the receivers to run their routes short or too tight. That is our job, to keep that zone stretched.

For years, the key on this play was the strong safety. If the strong safety went with the tight end, the quarterback read man coverage. He went to the flanker running the 18-yard in. That is a good read, but this is a play we would call against a zone team. The progression for throwing is flanker, tight end, and running back.

From this we call "69 H delay." If the linebackers don't get a good drop, there is a big hole in the middle to hit the tight end. When the linebackers get their drops under the tight end, we delay the running back and bring him out late and under the linebackers. The tailback steps up and waits for two counts. If nobody comes, he trickles out under the linebackers. We do this a lot on possession downs. When we have to have the first down, this is the play we run. Most of our delay patterns are backs coming out of the backfield. If the outside linebacker comes, the back blocks him first, then trickles off.

People began to play zone deep and man to man underneath. We went to "69 H option." On the H option, we look for the halfback all the way. The halfback has no blocking responsibility on this pattern. As soon as the ball is snapped, the halfback goes hard upfield for
