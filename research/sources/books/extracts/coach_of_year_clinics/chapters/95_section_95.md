We can change our secondary calls at any time. We may show three-deep and adjust into a man or a two-deep call.

Now I will show you a few of our best stunts from the alignments I have covered. Everyone here knows that when you stunt, you take a chance. We try to cover ourselves every way possible. We stunt for two basic reasons. We are trying to make something positive happen, or we cannot match up and we are trying to give ourselves a chance to win.

Our red-hot call in both the 40 and 50 schemes is an all-out blitz where we are bringing at least seven people. First is our 40red hot1.
