through. It is not going to be an easy street. We respect the fact that they are involved in a demanding sport. We must have a sense of humor. You bet!

What do we expect from players? They must be urgent. They must concentrate. We have to work to get them to concentrate. They have to cooperate in the concentration effort. Some of them may say, ''Why do we need to concentrate?'' Some players have a tough time concentrating. You need a mechanism to help them concentrate. Get those things in a formula, and you may have a chance.

We expect full compliance. "Why did you do it that way? How come you called that play?" "Because." "Get your butt in there and block." They need to have a will to prepare. Everyone wants to play in the games. Are they willing to prepare to play the games? Preparing is a bitch; at least it should be. They should think the game is a lark.

They must be accountable. They need to commit to something. This is tough for the youth of today. They must be willing to play a role. "What is the best role for you on this team? What do you think it is?" No; it isn't that. Here is what we think it is. We try to work with the players, but sometimes they will not be satisfied with what we decide. Coaches coach and players play and that is it, unless you are in the NBA. That is one of the reasons I only coached in the NFL for eight years. I have coached at every level except Pop Warner, and that may still be coming. This doesn't make me an expert on anything. One of the reasons I stepped away from the NFL was this. It was fun, but I did not make as much money as the players. That did not make sense to me. You have players who are making a million dollars, and you are only making 65 thousand or something like that as a coach. You have to understand that you are responsible for directing the traffic, and that is the way it is.

Finish. Put a circle around 
finish. 
This means that our players will do something special when they get to the end of a drill. He may sprint to a cone, do a forward shoulder roll, then get up and run to the end of the line. He is going to do something special to finish that drill. He does not just step over the large bags and walk back to the end of the line. He is going to move. We tell them that we want them to run or stand still-no walking. We can go out on the street to walk. They are young, and so they can run.

 [Editor's note. Coach Von Appen went on to discuss th
e 
role of concentration and finish in relation to the pass rush. However, due to technical difficulties, we were unable to reproduce the last part of the lecture.]
