Punting Drills and Techniques

Mississippi State University

It is a pleasure being here. I know this morning is kind of early for some of you guys. I see of lot of coaches here who are taking notes and seem to be organized. It is important to be organized. I went to speak at Coach Bryant's clinic in Alabama one year. I talked to them about being organized. That reminds me of a story.

This fellow was extremely organized. He wrote down in his notebook everything in every category. He got a visit one day from a guy who was inquiring whether he had been in Louisville on the 21st of February. The guy got out his notebook and began flipping through it. He looked under the category marked ''cities'' and told the fellow that he was in Louisville on the 21st. The fellow asked him if he was there on the 21st and 22nd. The guy looked in his book under "dates." He found out he was there on those dates. The fellow then asked him if he was at a Coach of the Year Clinic. The guy looked in his book under "clinics." He told the fellow that he was. The fellow asked him if he stayed at the Galt House Hotel. He looked under "hotels." He told the fellow that he certainly did. The fellow then ask him if he went to a place called O'Malleys. The guy looked under "watering holes." The answer again was yes. The fellow asked him if he met a lady named Mary. He looked under "names." Yes, the guy had met a lady named Mary. The fellow than asked if he spent the night with her. The guy looked under "entertainment." His answer was yes. The fellow jumps out of the chair and says, "Damn it, I don't like that; she was my wife." The guy looked in his book under "opinions." He told him, "You know, I didn't like it either."

Let's move along, and let some of these guys get in here. I'm going to spend some time this morning and go through the kicking game. But I'm also going to talk about the lost art of actually punting the ball. I remember the first job I had as a head coach. I was setting up the staff and doing all the little things. I asked my staff who could coach the punters. There wasn't a person on my staff who could coach the punter. At that time, we had a player that was a great punter. He was an All-Pac-10 punter. I decided to be the kicking coach. I wasn't going to let anybody screw him up.

Great players teach us a lot more than we can actually teach them. Over the years of coaching punters and kickers, I have derived some things. Ever since then, I get every book that comes out on the kicking game. It pleases me to know that what I have been teaching the punter was in all those books. The techniques remain the same. In the very short time today, I will be able to teach you how to teach your kids to punt. That doesn't mean they will be able to punt. That takes a certain amount of ability.

I have developed the four P's for punters. You 
prepare 
a young man to do something. You 
practice 
hard at it. You 
position 
him to do something that he has to 
perform. 
If he can't perform, you are not going to be able to do it.

Since the guys are still coming in and we are in Louisville, Kentucky, that reminds me of a guy who had just won the lottery. He went to a financial advisor. The advisor told him the hottest thing to invest his money in was race horses. It had the greatest returns on his money. He bought a race horse. The racing season was over in the United State, so he sent the horse to run on the European circuit. The first time his horse ran, he got a telegram. It says, "SSFF." He looked at the telegram and says, "Started second, finished first." He was excited. The horse was on the way back, so the guy decided to get a brass band and meet the trainer and horse. When the trainer got off the boat to the playing of the brass band, he looked at the owner and asked him if he had gotten his telegram. The owner said, "Yes, started second, finished first." The trainer said, "Hell no! He started, stumbled, farted, and fell."
