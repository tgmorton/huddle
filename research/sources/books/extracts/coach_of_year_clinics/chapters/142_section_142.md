The Eight-Man-Front Secondary Play

Ohio State University

Thank you. If you saw us play this year, you know that we had a great defense. We had some good players, and they were smart. They played hard. We had kids who understood the defense. There were two things that improved us to the status we had this year. We ended up in the top 10 of every defensive category there was. We finished number one in the country against the pass. We ended up fourth or fifth against the run. We had a good defense, and the credit goes to the players.

We had a pressure package. We weren't going to line up and play read defense. In our league, the average offensive lineman weighs about 310 pounds. We played with guys who were a whole lot smaller than that. We didn't want to get in a situation where we played a hit-and-read defense. If we had, we would have gotten mauled off the ball.

Our premise this year was to stop the run. We wanted to put people in passing situations so we could use our talent. We had two outstanding corners. We may have the first corner picked in the NFL draft, and he is only a junior. We basically told our corners to have a nice day on the outside. We were going to use the safeties to help stop the run.

We wanted to get people in a 2nd-and-long situation. To us, that is a 2nd and 8 or more. After we did, we were going to use a "zone dog." I believe in timing in the blitz. You have to be able to bluff and disguise the coverages and blitzes. We have to keep things simple, because of the 20-hour rule. When we go into a game, we are going to have basically two blitzes and two zone dogs for each front we play, plus our bluff scenario. When we get into the bluff game, it is important to understand the automatic system of the team you are playing. We want them to check off and take away what they are checking to.

With our defense, we play basically three fronts. We play a reduction, which we call "tight." We play this defense on 1st down and about 40 percent of the time. We have the ability to play two deep, a quarter scheme, and a weak zone from this defense.

We like to zone the formation in this defense. We call "tight 10 zone." We spoke our safety to wherever they run the ball. If the offense runs to the split end, we run sky support weak. The linebacker communicates that to the safeties. The down linemen play their gaps as they usually do. In this coverage, we pick up the extra player in the run game. We adjust to all sets to keep an extra man in the running scheme. In the Big Ten, the teams were not patient enough to throw the ball to the outside all the time. That is what we were giving up and forcing the offense to throw.

The next thing from this would be our man-free concept. We have the ability to show a sky-support defense and play man principles.

The second front we play about 25 percent of the time. We call it "slide." It is our stack package. There are three linebackers stacked off the ball. I was a linebacker coach for 12 years before I became the coordinator. Nine years ago, our defensive coordinator came in and wanted to play the Miami stack package, but he didn't coach the linebackers. We used to get our ass whipped with the tight zone cutback. We were asking a linebacker or safety to take an inside running gap. He had the ability to fall back into another zone. This year, we went to a 6 technique. We still played flow linebackers and quarter scheme and put the Leo end on the inside gap. That really helped our defense. We forced the ball to run east and west. We used our safeties for run support or robbers in pass coverage.
