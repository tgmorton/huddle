last thing is RUN THROUGH THE MAN. The biggest problem in tackling is dead feet on contact. If you can run your feet through the contact, you have a chance to win the battle.

When we talk techniques up front. The zero technique is head-up the center. The shade is on the center. The 's, 2's, and 3's are on the guard. The 4-eye, 4, and 5 are on the tackle. The 6, 7, and 9 techniques are on the tight end. When we talk gaps with our line, it is A, B, C, and D. With linebackers we number the gaps.

In the defensive line we want to screw with the heads of the offensive linemen. Our disguise in our defense is the front four people. We line up in different places. We line up in 8 to 9 different fronts with the front four people. Because of that we are starting to get splits n the offensive line about 6 inches wide. We feel like that is a positive for us. Eventually it generates more tackles for other people.

Our first front we call "BASE." We have our tackle in a 3 technique to the tight end. The nose tackle is in a backside shade on the center. Our weakside defensive end is called "Animal," and aligns in a 5 technique. Our strongside end is in a 9 technique on the tight end. Our Mike linebacker has his heels at 5 yards and is shaded strong on the center. Our Sam linebacker lines up in the C gap with his inside foot aligned on the crotch of the offensive tackle. The Will linebacker is a floater. We )lay him in a lot of places. That is our base front and what we are going to play about 50 percent of the time.

We play this defense all spring long. We won't play anything else. We learn how to play BASE first and play it well. Then we move on to something else. We show a two shell in the secondary. BASE is a good front or us. The problems come from the trap inside and the block-down kick-out on the end. We play him wide because he makes plays, but the tight end gets on our Sam linebacker pretty good sometimes.

The next front is called "G" front. The only difference in alignment is our nose player moves to the 1 technique on the inside shoulder of the weakside guard. We can call "G" with almost any of our other fronts. It is an adjustment. If we get two tight ends we go to automatic ''G." If we are getting wider splits between the guard and center it is automatic "G." We leave a lot of the adjustment up to the nose tackle. If there is a strong guard, we'll move over and make him block the nose tackle all the time. We want to take advantage of the weaker players. At this point and time in our conference, center play is a little down. We are finding smaller kids at center. Therefore we are playing quite a bit of BASE. Playing "G'' is obviously best for the weakside running game. When you play a 4-3 defense, offenses are going to attack your Will linebacker

At Saginaw we run the option and our defense is getting pretty good at stopping it. Our 5 technique is always on the dive. Our 9 technique is always on the quarterback. We plug the Sam linebacker on any flow at him. The Sam linebacker is playing at 5 yards and is plugging the C gap on any flow at him. That means Sam s the dive player on the option his way. The end has the quarterback and the pitch is covered from the secondary depending on coverage. If we are going to win the Division II National Championship, we have to stop the option. Most of those teams are option teams.

The defensive end always goes to the strength of the set and the Animal to the weak side. Since they have moved the hash mark in, there are really no boundary and field positions any more. We always call the strength to the tight end. The reason we do it is personnel. The nose tackle always goes with the Animal and the tackle is always to the end's side. Strength call is important to us and we have to see it early. The first thing the Sam linebacker does at the beginning of the weak is to know who the tight end is.
