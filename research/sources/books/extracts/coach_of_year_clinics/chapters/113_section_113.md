that Tim Biakabuttuko ran so well at Michigan), and the lead draw. From the outside zone, we run the toss sweep (pitch), the option (lead option), and our off-tackle play that we call the slant. We also run some misdirection like the inside trap, the counter, and play action. We basically zone everything, or in the case of the lead draw, we use a man scheme. We really feel that we have to stick to our base plays and not invent new plays each week. This helps so much with our players' confidence, and we can see them improve each week. Since we have very little new learning from week to week, it helps our players to play with more aggressiveness and reckless abandon. We will go through the play book again later this spring. I want every play in there to serve a specific purpose. If it doesn't, then it will have to go. We still practice plays that are not run in the games enough. I have to either call them more or get rid of them. It is hard to let plays go. There are so many good plays that could be run. A lot of teams that run the zone scheme use a handoff sweep. We had it in and got rid of it. It's a great play but didn't give us anything that our toss sweep didn't already give us. We do not change our offense when we get near the goal line. We have to keep it simple. Our kids are not going to the NFL after Hope. They are going to be doctors and lawyers and teachers. We have very little meeting time outside of practice, and I hate to use on-the-field time to talk. I want on-the-field time used for reps as much as possible, so we have to keep it simple.

Our players know that the plays that get us into the red zone will be the plays used in the red zone. There is no reason to change. I like to use the plays that our players have confidence in.

Practice

A. Drill at full speed. This teaches games like angles, body position, reaction to defenders, and conditioning/effort.

B. Drills that pertain to the job must be done.

C. Work body on body as much as possible.

D. Repetitionsmust have it; do it again.

Stance

I want the toes out a little bit and not the other way around as many of us have been coached. I want a balanced stance that will allow us to make contact on the second step. I don't want my linemen to chop their feet in place. Don't get me wrongI want them to have quick feet, but chopping them in place before a drill does not help us get what we want. If you look at tape of offensive line play, you'll notice that you still have to plant your feet to move or to strike a player. I want the weight on the balls of the feet. I want the hand under the chin for balance. I want the feet under the body, again, for balance. As far as the hands go, I don't want a big windup. We work all of our drills with the hands out in front of our bodies. Our splits vary according to three things: (1) the alignment of the defense, (2) the play that is called, and (3) the quality of the defensive personnel that we are facing.

There are two kinds of leverage: inside and underneath. I want the elbows in. It works on the same principle as many of the martial arts. Stay compact on impact for a more direct blow. Tony Wise of the Chicago Bears gave me a great idea on how to work on this. He said to take an old car inner tube, cut it into 1- to 2-inch strips, and use it like a big rubber band. We do a lot of drills with these bands around our wrists to keep our hands and elbows in. I cut these up last summer. Don't make the same mistake I did. I went to the tire shop in town and had the man give me about 15 old inner tubes. I found out that you can make about 500 bands out of 15 inner tubes. One or two will give you all the bands you need.

Blocking is not the same as it was in the old days. We don't grab our jerseys and shoulder-block anymore. It is important to keep the hands inside the cylinder of the body. This helps cut down on holding penalties too. The second kind of leverage is underneath leverage. The low man will win most battles in the line. We work to keep our pad level lower than our opponent's. On many of the drills we do, I tell my linemen that they should be looking up at the chin of the man they are blocking.
