Against a 50 front, the frontside tackle will chip the man on him by stepping with the right foot (option right) and proceed upfield, checking for a frontside plug by the onside linebacker, then proceed to the backside linebacker. The pulling guard will climb the hole and hope to get a log cut on the end man. The tight end blocks down on the man on our tackle. If we can get a log cut on the defensive end, the fullback bounces outside and blocks the onside linebacker. We option the force.

OPTION VS. 50 FRONT

If the rush end comes upfield, we will kick the end out, our fullback will come underneath the kick block, and the quarterback will duck up underneath as well.

50 FRONT-RUSH END UPFIELD

Against a 4-3 front, our tackle will pin-block. Again, we will either kick the rush end out or log-cut him. The fullback and quarterback will again read the guard's block to determine whether to go inside or underneath.

9-TECHNIQUE RUSH

If the rush end slants inside, our tight end jumps the slant and blocks the rush. Our guard will now block the man who the tight end was to have blocked. Our fullback will still bounce outside and block the playside linebacker.

DEFENSIVE-END SLANT

This play is our best option on the guard log. In our power set, we will assign our wingback to second deep. Against the 6-2 guard log, we will have our center scramble the 1 technique on the guard. We use the same technique on the defensive tackle as we did against the 5 technique on a 50 front. The fullback and quarterback will read this block on the defensive end and either go around or come up underneath if we have to kick the end out.

VS. 6-2 FRONT, GOAL LINE
