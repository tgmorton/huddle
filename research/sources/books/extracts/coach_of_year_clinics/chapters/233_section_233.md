Zone Defense from Goal Line to Goal Line

University of Georgia

This topic came up as a result of a conversation with one of the foremost high school coaches in Georgia, Dan Pitts down at Mary Persons High School in Forsyth. When Coach Ray Lamb asked me to speak at this clinic quite a while back, he asked me to pick a topic. I was fortunate enough to speak at the Georgia Athletic Coaches Association last summer. I did an hour-and-one-half lecture on individual drills and techniques. I will talk at our clinic about the two-deep and some other things. Again, I am speaking to a lot of the Georgia high school coaches. I am a little perplexed, because I want to give you something to take away from here.

Coach Pitts came up to visit with me one day. He asked me about zone coverages. He felt he needed to blitz more, but he wanted to play man to man. I started showing him the type of blitzes we run. Every time I showed him a blitz, we were playing some type of man coverage, or we were in a combo or nickel package. Coach Pitts just sat there shaking his head. He did not like what he was hearing. We talked about running the blitz with zone coverage. We agreed that this was nothing new to NFL teams because they have been doing it for a long time. They can do that by having great personnel.

I coached at Maryland for 10 years, and we played Penn State each of those 10 years. They played a lot of zone coverage with the blitz. Coach Pitts liked that idea a lot better, because he liked to play zone coverage. We solved some of his problems, and he went back to Forsyth. I sat there later and decided that I would make my topic zone defense.

will cover a number of zones. The first thing we must talk about is this: What do you want to get out of playing zone coverage? There are a lot of different zones. What does the zone give you? What do you get out of it? I listed the things that we want out of the zone.

Ten Commandments of Zone Defense

1. There is more than one defender to the ball.

In a zone defense, everyone looks at the ball. That is the number one thing you must do in defense, regardless of the level you are in. People who play good defense always have more than one person to the ball. That is the way we start out everything in the secondary. There are four of us back deep, and there is only one ball. We have a number of drills that we used to teach our players to get to the ball. That is the first thing we want to do. We want more than one defender to the ball. That will help us stop the deep pass. That is the second thing you want to do. If we get more than one defender to the ball, we will not get the deep ball. The third thing we want to do on defense is to stop the yardage after the catch. This has brought about the West Coast offense, which is throwing the 5-yard pass to Jerry Rice over the middle and having him run for 50 yards down the field. After every game we chart yards gained after the catch. That is significant to the outcome of the game. We do not want to give up a 5-yard pass and a 50-yard run. That is 55 yards. We want them to earn those yards. We do not want them to get any yardage after the catch. Other things in these 10 commandments are associated with our philosophy of yardage after the catch.

I listened to John Madden comment in a play-off game after our season was over. He said that most NFL teams were defending the West Coast offense by staying in their zones. They let the receivers catch the ball underneath and then knock the hell out of the receivers. That is what the zone defense was designed for in the first place.

2. Defend areas of the field. 

We are going to put our players in certain areas of the field. Why? Because we want to defend that area. That is what we want to defend. If we play a three-deep zone, we are going
