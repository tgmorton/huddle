The corners played inside out, man to man. That gave us nine people in the box.

The third defense, which we played about 25 percent, was the 46 defense. We have played this defense since 1983. The guy who this defense was named for, Doug Plank, helped us install it. We have pretty good input on what is going on in this defense. It was a double-eagle look. When we played this defense, it was probably our best defense statistically.

The key thing on this is that the linebacker coverage in the three defenses does not change whether you are playing man or zone. The secondary does not change in the three defenses. We are playing different fronts, but we are playing the same coverages with all the fronts. That cuts down your teaching. A lot of people wanted to know how we improved this year. I think we have a great defensive staff. We had a good understanding of what we were trying to accomplish. The thing we improved the most was stopping the big play. We consider a run over 10 yards and a pass over 15 yards a big play. Our opponents had only 23 running plays over 10 yards in an 11-game season. Out of the 23 runs, 6 of them were reverses. Of the other 17, about half of them were missed tackles. The year before, we had 93 runs over 10 yards. The reason for that was we took away one of the bubbles in our stack defense, and we started using our safeties in our run defense. When I talk about the bubble, I'm talking about playing a 6 technique over the tight end instead of a 9 technique.

We studied our films and found that most of the big plays came from lack of tackling. Over the last 10 years, the big fad has been stripping the football. We work the crap out of that. I'm not sure that we took away from our kids the ideas of tackling. From the first day of spring ball, we practice tackling every day that we are in pads. If we met on the practice field, as long as we had head gear on, we practiced tackling. We became a much better tackling team this year.

The third thing we did was work on an attitude principle. Attitude means a lot of different things. The first thing we wanted was to be tough. We wanted to be the "get after 'em" team, the hustle guys, and the hitting team. I think the big thing was the way we handled the mental things on the sideline. If we had a mental mistake or a physical screwup, we didn't jump their asses when they came off the field. We had a "so what" attitude. We felt that the next play was the most important one. We can't do anything about the other play. We said, "Let's go back and play some more defense.'' We gave all of our kids silver bullets. They were empty of course. That was our motto. We wanted silver bullets flying to the ball. The big deal was that the most important play is the next play. Play the play you are playing hard. Play with great physical effort. If you don't make the play, hell with it. Get ready for the next one.

We tried to get our safeties involved in rundowns. When we called our tight front, we checked the coverage to the formation they come out in. We call defenses by the personnel that the offense puts out on the field.

I'm going to show you our tight 10 zone. This is our huddle call and our automatic system. A lot of communication goes on in our huddle system. The Willie linebacker is checking the opposite sideline and trying to call out the different personnel groups that are coming on the field from the opponent's bench. He would call out "snake." To us, that means two tight ends and one back. If he called "viper," that would be three wideouts and one back. Those are examples of our terminology. The linebacker who calls the defense knows who is in the game, and that helps him make the calls.

If the offense comes out in regular personnel, he makes a left call. When he said "left," that aligned our defensive line. The bubble goes to the call side. Our nose guard is in a 1 technique to the tight end. The defensive end is in a 5 technique. To the weak side the tackle is in the 3 technique, and the Leo is in a 5
