We protected our throw well and hit our wide receiver for a 79-yard touchdown. It was from a running formation and a "check with me" call.

Here are some of the things we are doing offensively. We do this if you let us. We line up in the I formation and run power football. We run the isolation both ways. If our fullback can block your linebacker, you are in trouble. We will run our 22-23 isolation play 15 to 20 times a game, if our fullback can block your linebacker. We try to predetermine which one of your linebackers is not really physical. If you have two good linebackers inside who are better than our fullback, we are not going inside.

Coaching is not asking your players to do things they can't do. If our fullback can't handle your inside linebackers, we'll go to two tight ends. That makes the defense balance and puts them in a situation where they can't hide anyone. Most people are like us. Our Will linebacker is about half and half. He is about half strong safety and half linebacker. He is a 205pound linebacker. If we play a team that is trying to hide a guy like that, we go to our two tight ends. We double-down and kick out on him. That gives us a mismatch between our fullback and your Will linebacker.

In the Rose Bowl Arizona State had a defensive end who was all Pac 10. He was 6' 2", and 222 pounds. He was a great pass rusher, and they played him on the split-end side. We lined up and traded our tight end over to the other side. We had a 6'7", 265-pound tight end blocking on this 222-pound pass rusher. It was a mismatch. To make up for the mismatch, they went to an eight-man front. That forced them into man coverage in the secondary. We run both our tight ends on short patterns to the left.

Their corner and free safety were playing man to man on them. Our freshman wide receiver, Darrell Boston, was man to man against the other corner with half the field to work into. He ran a post cut, and we hit him for 79 yards off a play-action pass. When we had Joey Galloway two years ago, people were afraid to play eight-man fronts on us. If they did, they had to play Galloway man to man. There is not one guy in the world who can cover Joey Galloway man to man. There is too much speed out there to defend with one man.

You guys have a wrong impression about Ohio State if you think that all we do is run the ball. We have more guys in the NFL playing wide receiver than anyone. They played at Ohio State, where we run off tackle all day. The point I am trying to make is that we do both: run and pass.

The first play we are going to try to run against you is our bread-and-butter play. It is the 22-23 isolation. The coaching points are pretty simple. We use a man blocking scheme. The onside tackle lead-steps the defensive tackle to the outside and tries to stretch him as wide as possible. The tight ends base up on the defensive end. The onside guard and center double the nose guard to the backside linebacker. The backside guard and tackle turn out on the reduced front to the weak side. The fullback comes off the double team and isolates the inside backer. That is the first play in our offense that we try to run. We work hard on this play in practice. It is a physical play. This is how we toughen our linebackers in the spring. They have to step forward and meet that fullback at the line.

The next play we run is our 24-25 sprint draw. This is the same kind of blocking scheme, except it is run off a play-action passing action. Our tailback takes a little hop and crossover step and gets the ball deeper. The blocking is the same, except the back runs to daylight. We had Orlando Pace playing our left tackle. Because he was such a good run blocker and we ran at him so much, defenses would align four defensive men to his side. It is hard to run the sprint draw toward him when you can't account for all the defenders.

To help us, we ran motion with our flanker to get an extra blocker to that side to account for the fourth
