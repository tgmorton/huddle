We still have to defend the side pockets. The corners are going to collision the wide receivers, except this time we want them to work back at an angle so that they are at the bottom of that side pocket as the ball is thrown. This allows our two safeties to be tighter and stronger in the middle.

We get a good hit against the tight end from the linebacker on this look. He can read pass or run from his position. This 4-3 front is more conducive to handling the man down the middle. Now the corners come back and pattern-read. They form a visual triangle from the wide receiver to the near back in the backfield. They slide out of the area and get back to the bottom of the side pocket. They must be ready to react to anything coming in their zone. They should be able to help on the fade route. The two safeties know the corners are sagging. They know the fade has to come in deeper, and that gives them more time to play the fade. They will stick more to the inside and help us there.

This defense is really big when they move the tailback into the slot on the back side. Now they have two receivers, and we have three defenders. We have to win. We've got to win. On the strong side, they have two receivers, and we have three defenders. We have to win. The reason I like two deep is because we force them to run to certain areas and in certain patterns. We continue to get more than one person to the ball. We can practice and practice and practice and get good at it. It takes a lot of the passing game away from the offense. It gives you great perimeter support. In essence, it gives you nine men up front. If they run the screen pass, you have it turned in. If they run the toss or the option play, you have a corner outside. In 1972 and 1973, no one played two deep. They did play two deep with man coverage underneath. Now you can see this coverage about 90 percent of the time. You see this coverage and a weak zone coverage. Those are the two predominant coverages in college football today.

Let me get to the last coverage. This is the zone blitz with a three-deep coverage. I took this off one of our game tapes. It is what you see from the Carolina Panthers. They defend the pass from the eyes of the quarterback. So do we. The quarterback comes out, and what does he see? Two deep! He sees two linebackers inside and a five-man line. In essence, it is a run defense. From this look, the quarterback thinks he can throw the ball deep. He thinks he can throw to the flat. He thinks he can do a lot with the ball.

ZONE BLITZTHREE DEEP

When the ball gets snapped, it is just like a covey of quail. Our defenders are going all over the place. As soon as the ball touches the quarterback, he looks up, and now he sees a three-deep secondary. The nose and tackle stunt on the strong side. Now, on the short side, the backer is in the A gap. The tackle drops off the line to the hook zone. The outside linebackers are rush and contain players. They make contact with the man on the line, keeping the outside arm free. They are going to keep the quarterback in that pocket. By doing all of this switching, they have disrupted all of the passing lanes that the quarterback has worked against. It no longer is a basic five-man rush or even a basic four-man rush. He doesn't know where the passing lane is with everyone moving around. This is only one blitz. There may be 50 of them.

What happens if you are playing man to man and you get beat deep? Everyone looks at the secondary coach and says, ''He is a dumb ass.'' Now, this zone blitz made me a hell of a lot smarter. It may have kept me in coaching 10 more years. Now when the defensive coordinator calls that blitz, I am up in the press box drinking Coke. Why? I have three deep. The
