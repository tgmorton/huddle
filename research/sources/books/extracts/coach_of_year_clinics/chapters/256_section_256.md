TRAP OPTION VS. 4-4

Now, we are going to option the end man on the line. We are going to pull and escape with the guard on the linebacker. We pull and overtake the center. Between the guard and tackle on the play side, we should get the linebacker blocked. If the guard cannot get the linebacker on the play side, he should go to the backside linebacker.

The thing we like about this play is this. The action of the backs holds the linebackers in place. We can get the play walled off. We will option against the linebacker if he is on the line of scrimmage. If he is walked off, the tight end will go block him. That is the way we attack the 4-4 with the linebacker off the line.

The last trap I want to talk about is our tackle trap. The play looks like the inside zone to one side. There is a definite cutback. We look at where the defense lines up on our guard in the area where we are going to trap. If they line up in a 3 technique, the pulling tackle will go up inside on a linebacker. If he lines up heads up to the inside, we will trap on the line of scrimmage. Let me show you three situations so you can see how it works. We have tackles that are mobile and can run this play.

First, I will show you the play against the eagle look. The tackle on the split side is in a 3 technique. This means that we are going to trap the linebacker with our offside tackle. The nose is generally offset. The center takes the offset nose by himself. The play starts out looking like an inside zone play to the tight-end side. The strong-side guard steps outside, checks for the tackle slanting down inside, and then takes on the linebacker. 

TACKLE TRAP VS. EAGLE FRONT

The quarterback brings the ball straight back to the tailback, as deep as he can get it to him, and lets the tailback read the play. The tailback aims at the strongside guard and cuts it back behind the tackle's trap block. The fullback fills off the tackles. The tailback starts off to the strong side and cuts back behind the tackle's block. The split-side guard and tackle take the 3 and 5 techniques. They show a quick-pass setup, then come off and block those two linemen.

TACKLE TRAP VS. 4-4 FRONT

Here we have a noseguard who is offset. The man is on the center. Again, the pulling tackle is going to block the linebacker. Since our tackle is uncovered, the fullback will block the end, and our end will block the linebacker.
