Quarterback Drills and the Passing Game

Furman University

I tried to get my wife to type out the information for the overhead, but she insisted that I do it, so here goes. First, I want to talk about seven traits of a great quarterback.

1. He must demonstrate leadership and responsibility. The quarterback must be able to communicate in tough situations. He must be willing to take the blame and the glory. He must be a leader on and off the field.

2. He must be a competitor. He must hate to lose. He must be competitive in practice. He must be ready to compete in all phases of the game.

3. He must be confident. He must have confidence to the borderline of being cocky. He must inspire confidence in his teammates.

4. He must have credibility. We hear the expression, "You're the man." In football, the quarterback must be "The Man." His teammates must believe in him. When it is 3rd and 6 on the last drive and you must stick the ball in the end zone, 
the team must believe in him.

5. He must have an instinctive mental process. He must be able to react on the move. He must know all of the assignments for the entire team.

6. He must have a quick delivery. I know it is great to have a quarterback who is big and can run, but if you are going to throw the ball today, you must have a quarterback who has a quick delivery. He must not wind up to throw the ball. He must be able to get the ball out of his hand.

7. He must be a playmaker. This is the most important of these seven traits. He must make the difference in winning and losing.

A quarterback must believe in himself, and his work must convince his teammates that he can be trusted when all else fails. I think this about sums everything up about the quarterback's position. The quarterback is the man who must step up and make the play. He must get the ball in the hands of the best receiver or the best running back. He must be trusted by his teammates.

The big thing we look at in the passing efficiency rating is this: How many interceptions did the quarterback throw? The next thing we look at is percentage of completions. I will talk about accuracy percentage later.

Next, I want to talk about drills we do in practice. First, we run air routes. We start with wide receivers. Later we bring in the tailback, fullback, and tight ends. We want a lot of air routes thrown during the early practice.

The next route we work on is one of the best for the wide receivers. It is a one-on-one versus the defensive backs. We also use the tight end in the drill. We split the receiver, and the defensive man lines up and plays him man-to-man.
