We prefer to run our trap up the middle into an even front. We will usually "either/or" the play so that we can trap the widest 2 technique. We never send in the play to go one way or the other. We always "either/ or" the play. The center will block back to the tightest 2 technique. If they are even, it doesn't matter. The quarterback has the option to go to either side. The quarterback is schooled to pin the tightest 2 technique. We are always pinning our center back on the tightest 2 technique. If you do not do that, the center will have to block the 3 technique, and that is a hard block. That 3 technique can screw up the play because he can get up the field in that position, so the first thing the quarterback has to do is to decide which way he wants to run the play. He can go one way or the other with it.

Our trapping guard is taught to take a drop step, then climb the hole on his second step. His first step is to lose ground and gain a little distance. The second step is right back up into the hole. We do not want him going flat down the line and aiming for one particular man. He is aiming for an area. Our best traps come when the defense loops the tackle outside and plugs the linebacker. Oftentimes we will end up trapping a plugging linebacker.

The tackle on the side that we are going to trap will block the first linebacker on his inside seam. If no one is there, he finds the first linebacker inside. We tell our tackle to aim flat and anticipate the linebacker stepping up. We tell our fullback to aim at the cheek of the center opposite the hole. The quarterback will reverse around and give the fullback the ball as he turns. The guard on the side that the trap will take place will either (1) quick-draw or (2) head-bob, or arm over the man on him, and go to the first linebacker inside.

VS. 4-4

Against a 4-3 front, when we are trapping a 2 technique, we may use a quick draw by our guard not involved in the trapping. Our tackle on the side that we are trapping will be assigned the middle linebacker. Our other tackle will reach the linebacker on his side; if he is heads up to the inside, he will block that linebacker.

VS. 4-3

When we trap against an odd front, we pull our guard and come up on the linebacker. Our tackle on the trap side will reach-block the man on him. Our backside tackle blocks the linebacker on his side. Our non-trapping guard will help the center with the noseguard. Then he runs a "do-dad" block for the backside linebacker.

DO-DAD

If the noseguard is offset, the center will handle the offset by himself. The non-trapping guard will release directly to the backside linebacker.
