and Kentucky so that each year we can get between 7 and 15 players, that will be about 50 percent of our scholarships. If we can get the best players from this area who can play in the SEC, we have a big head start.

The reason I like to recruit this way is because of what I have experienced over the years. A lot of you have had great players who go on to college football and just seem to get lost in the shuffle. Here is what happens. You send a linebacker coach to Texas, and he recruits an offensive lineman. What happens to the kid from Texas? The kid is 17 years old and is a senior in high school. The linebacker coach is 40 years old. The two develop a close relationship over the 11 or 12 months of the recruiting period. The coach convinces the player how good he is. He spends a lot of time either calling him, writing him, or seeing him. He convinces him to come to UK, or Tennessee, or wherever. They develop a close relationship. The player signs. Then comes August 5, and the season comes around. He is an offensive lineman. He comes to the campus, and who does he deal with when he gets there? He deals with the offensive linemen and the offensive line coach. That is who he spends about 17 of the 20 hours per week that we are allowed to work with them. When is he ever going to see the linebacker coach who signed him? Hardly ever. If the player is on the scout team, the coach may see him. When do they ever talk or visit? We do not want that to happen to our players. We are not going to recruit that way. If we can recruit in this area and get to know the players over a period of years at camps, then we will sign them. But we are going to send the position coach to recruit the players.

You see kids all of the time who get caught in staff politics and do not make it. Now, if one of our coaches tells me that he does not like a player, I can tell him it is his fault because he recruited him. I can tell him to get down there and start liking him. They are not excused. This eliminates a lot of problems. This is what I am talking about: having a vision about what you are doing.

You must have a vision of how you are going to accomplish a set of objectives. Our set of objectives at the University Of Kentucky is to win the SEC. I mean in 
football. 
I wanted to say that so that everyone would know what I was saying. I love Rick Pitino. I think he does a great job. I had a great week with him this past week. I went with him to play Alabama. He is one hell of a coach and a good guy. We want to win in football. His program is the one we would like to emulate.

That is my idea of where we are as far as an update on Kentucky football. We have to recruit some more players. We do have a vision, and we do have a plan. We want all of you to get involved in the plan. We have a JV program for our walk-on players. That is the way we are going to handle that situation. Ever since the NCAA started the gender equity plan, they said we could only bring in 105 players to two-a-day practices. Well, 85 of those players are scholarship players. That means you only have 20 walk-ons. In this area, I will promise you, there are more than 20 players who want to walk on at UK. Coach Hatcher is here today. He has an office full of tapes of players who want to walk on. At this point, we have about 100 who have indicated that they want to walk on.

Each year we can invite 20 players to walk on. If we have 70 to 80 players who want to walk on, then we make 50 to 60 players mad. What we are going to do is this. We are not going to bring any of them. If they are walk-ons, they come when school starts. They will play a JV schedule. This may sound old-fashioned, because most teams do not do this anymore except service academies. We are going to play a four-game JV schedule. Those players will not practice with the varsity. We have a staff made up of GAs and student coaches. By doing this, they will get looked at. They will play Hargrave Military Academy, Georgia Military, and Middle Georgia College. Also, Campbellsville College JVs have agreed to play us. We are going to play a four-game schedule with those walk-ons in October. Instead of only bringing 20 in August, we can bring them all out when school starts.

Walk-ons do three things in Division I football. They sit on one knee and eat a lot of ice, then they get unhappy, then they quit. That is about it. They do not really get looked at. It is hard to show what they can do when all they do is run scout-team plays. They get tired of
