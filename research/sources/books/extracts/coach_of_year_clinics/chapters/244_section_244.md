down the sled a live cut block. He has to play the cut live by turning the head, playing the back pad, and flattening him out. The last thing he does is the tackle. We work on strike, explosion, hand placement, and getting his hip across.

You have to be creative. Do combination drills. Don't tell me you don't have enough time. You don't have enough time if you are stupid. There is no place for stupidity in the game. You have to think to stay ahead of the head coach who is going to cut your period short. He is going to fire you if you can't coach. He'll call you in at the end of the year and tell you, "We are going in a different direction." I must get the things taught, regardless of whether he gives me enough time or not.

Here is some philosophical BS for you young coaches. These are the principles of good defense. I believe this and have done it from the junior high level up. (1) You have to have great communication in your defense. I'm going to show you something here in a minute on game planning that will make you shake your head. You won't believe we do it. Communication is vital to defensive football team. You have to communicate, and everyone has to be on the same page.

(2) We coach techniques and give them different types. However, the players have to make the decision on what specific technique to use on a particular down. As an example, I have a 225 linebacker. He tries to play "hat and hands" and gets his hands inside on a 340-pound, 7' 9" offensive guard. He gets engulfed and taken down. The officials only call holding when it gets really bad. I'm not going to teach him to play a "hat and hands" technique in this situation. I'm going to teach him a flipper technique. He delivers the flipper and knocks the crap out of that guard. He gets under his pads and gets his body in the hole. He may get buried, but at least the ball is cutting back.

(3) Can you effect change? If you want to know the difference between being a good coach and a great coach, this is it. You can't affect their size or speed, but you can effect change. If you can't, you don't need to be coaching. You decide who plays. If he doesn't play at the effort level you want, why in the hell is he playing? That is one thing I want said about me. When people see my linebackers play, they say, "Those guys play all out." If they don't, you will see the next guy going in. I'll get a fresh one in there who is going to bust his butt to get to the ball. The guy I took out comes over yelling and MFing me about his incentive clause for his number of plays. I tell him that if he wants to play and make that incentive clause, he better bust his butt to the ball. If you take a lazy step, you are over by me. He is not going to play unless he plays all out.

In 1993, we were the number one special team in the league. We were very simple as far as scheme. I had seven rookies on that team. We were number one because of effort. They flew to the ball with reckless abandon. You can make that happen. It is a sin if you allow them to take lazy steps.

(4) Intelligence is what we would all like. We would like to have smart players, but I've coached some dumb ones, just as you have. If the dumb guy can play, you've got to find a place for him. Chuck Knox told me this, "If that kid is good enough to play, then you better be smart enough to coach him." It has nothing to do with the kid's intelligence; it has to do with yours. For the ones who aren't very smart, you have to find a way for them to succeed. If they know their own element of what will make the defense successful, they have to do it.

We are a pressure-package defense. We are the only defense in the United States at any level that has the last say. Most offensive teams say they have the last say because they have the automatic system. I'll tell you really quickly how that comes about. Blitzing pressure teams are selling tickets right now. If you have an offensive-minded head coach, he wants you to get the ball back to him in a hurry. I don't want a 14play drive going on while the All-American quarterback stands on the sideline with his thumb up his butt. The instructions are clear from the head coach: Get the ball back.

If you are a good blitzing team, you have to do these things.
