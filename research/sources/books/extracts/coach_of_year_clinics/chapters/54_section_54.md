makes your secondary go against your best players in stressful situations. When we go scout team, the defense is on top of the quarterback before he can throw the ball.

We run another route very similar to this. We like to get into the trips look because we like to run the speed option, strong or weak. We like to look at soft run support. You cannot throw the ball if you cannot make the defense worry about stopping the run. You must make the defense support the area on the outside. We like to run the speed option inside the 20 because we do not have to block as many people

We run a wide- drag combination that is very similar to the shallow route. Now we have both ends running across the field. We do not teach them to pick. If the defense runs into us, that is part of the game. We do not teach the pick. If the defense is in man, we have our best receiver running a full-speed crossing route. We can run this play from a lot of formations. The idea is that one of the two ends will be open.

We have an 80 route for the outside receivers. We have the outside man coming over the top on the post route. If the defense is in man and the safety gets hung up, we will try to get the ball deep. If the defense is in a zone, we usually hit the other wideout on a curl route.

One of the best plays in the game today is the stretch or zone play. Now teams are running the naked boot off the stretch play. The question for us on that play is what kind of route the inside man will run. We do not want the quarterback to rush the play. If the defense is not fooled and comes for the quarterback, he must be ready to throw the ball to the tight end coming across. If the defense is fooled, he can look to the flat area.

After the quarterback comes out of the fake, he always looks deep. We call it the Ray Charles play. Very seldom is he going to throw the deep ball, but as he comes out of the fake, we want him to look for the deep man. If the deep man is not open, the quarterback looks for the 30 route on the outside or the tight end coming across. The man on the boundary needs to know where he is on the field. If he is on the hash mark, he can come across quickly. If he is in the middle of the field, he will have to settle down. He does not want to get over too far.

We like to put the backs in motion inside the 20-yard line. We like to run the stretch play where we can secure the edge. We are not talking about the running game, but we want to secure the edge so we can get the ball to the next level.

Another thing we may do is to call toss or quick screen. The only difference between the stretch and toss is this: We are going to use zone blocking with our line, but our quarterback is going to turn and toss the ball to our tailback and let him run with it a little more quickly.

What happens when you call the quick screen? Half of the time, you end up checking out of the thing. We always package the screen with a running play. If the defense plays us two on two, we will throw the screen. If they play us in base coverage, we run it up and down the field.

One more point before I quit. As we get closer to the goal line, one of our favorite plays is the flood route. Again, we like to package it with a sprint-out pass action. Even if our quarterback is not really agile, we will run that action. We make it look just like the flood route, but we end up blocking people. Now, we run the play, and they are playing pass. We come out making the play look like the pass, and the quarterback runs the ball. You would be surprised, even if you have a limited athlete as quarterback, how well that play works. He can walk into the end zone with the ball. Now, the better the quarterback, the better the play will work. If we send a man in motion and the defensive man runs with him, they are playing man. If he does not go with motion, we have to make an adjustment and hit another receiver. Men, it was great being here.
