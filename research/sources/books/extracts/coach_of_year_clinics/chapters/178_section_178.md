can't get ahead of Iowa 23-10 going into the fourth quarter and not be very good. But when it got thick in the end, we had too many young players. We didn't have enough prime-time warriors who believed they could make the big play at the end of a game. When they started having that little bit of doubt, they took the apple. They made mistakes they had never made before.

We got a turnover against Penn State on the 14 with less than four minutes to go in the game. We followed that with the three worst plays we had run in the football game. We had 550 yards and got three straight plays with negative yards. After that, we missed the field goal. The guy hadn't missed a field goal inside the 30-yard line all year.

Next the defense came on the field. We had 2nd and long. We doubled the slot receiver. He ran straight across the field. We were playing him inside and outside. The guy who was supposed to take him inside just looked at him. He caught the pass and ran 36 yards into field-goal position for them with less than two minutes to go. We had played the coverage three or four times before correctly. What happened to that guy? I'm not blaming the kid. I'm saying we are not at a level of maturity where guys believe that they can make the play.

In the Michigan game, we were behind 14-10. We went into our two-minute offense with 50 seconds left in the first half. We were on the 50-yard line. We threw an interception, and the guy returned it to our 10-yard line. They scored with 19 seconds left on the clock. They kicked off, and we fumbled the kickoff. They went right in and scored again. With 15 seconds left in the half, they scored 14 points. The second half and the rest of the game, we played all right. Can you overcome that adversity? It is difficult against good football teams. All the teams that I was talking about are good football teams.

I think that all these things come from not believing in yourself, having self-imposed limitations on yourself as to what you can and can't accomplish. They don't have enough confidence in themselves that they can make the play in the most critical time of the game to win the game. That comes from mental toughnessand a lot of self-confidence.

Self-imposed limitations are the doubt we all have. How many times have you as a coach been sitting in the locker room before a big game and had doubts about whether you can win or not? It happens to me sometimes. It happens to your players too.

There was the fisherman in West Virginia. He went fishing. He caught a big fish and a little fish. He threw the big fish back in and kept the little fish. I asked him why he didn't keep the big fish and throw the little one back. He said that he only had a nine-inch frying pan. He put limitations on himself as to what kind of fisherman he could be by what kind of frying pan he had.

I ask our players sometimes how big a frying pan they have. How much confidence do they have? It is important to develop an attitude that you can be successful with.

I can't speak at a clinic without talking about this stuff. I think that's the essence of getting intangibles out of football players. They are simple things like giving effort, playing with toughness, being responsible for your own self-determination, and knowing what you are supposed to do. Those things sound really simple, but how many games do we lose on mental mistakes? How many times do you watch a film where someone is not loafing? How many times do you see your team not demonstrate the kind of toughness, physically and mentally, that you would like for them to play with? Those are all intangibles. It takes no ability to do these things, but very few time do we see them. You have to have a well-conditioned team to be able to do it. If you are not a well-conditioned team, that is when you make mistakes. They make mental mistakes, loaf, and lack toughness when they are tired. Who said, "Fatigue makes cowards of us all"? Of course you know that it was Vince Lombardi.

Let's talk about cover one. The term MOF means middle-of-the-field safety. Anything that has this type of coverage is taught with the same principles and theory. Whether we play three-deep zone with strong
