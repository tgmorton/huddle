want to do it, it is very simple to do it. I teach this to the quarterbacks in our camps. It is just a matter of telling the quarterback whether we are going to run the sweep to the right side; if the defense has more people on that side than we do, we want to run the play to the left side. If the defense has more people on the left side, we want to run it to the right side. That is basically the way we do it. We may call "check 48-49." We come up to the line and run it either way we want to.

Another thing I think you can help your quarterback with is this: Most quarterbacks do not have a good system of coming up to the line of scrimmage. They get in the huddle and call the play: "46 on 2; ready, break." The quarterback comes out of the huddle with his head down and walks up to the line that way. They come up to the line and do not get their head up. What does that do for the other team? That quarterback does not show much confidence. We want the quarterback to get a definite process of looking weak to strong, strong to weak, or left to right. We see some quarterbacks break the huddle and start looking toward the area where they are going to throw the ball on each play. We want a definite process of coming to the line.

This is a simple play, but if you can package it with a running play, it not only gives you a chance to be an aggressive football team, but it is a high-percentage throw for the quarterback. It is easy to complete if the defense gives you some zone-type look. If it is two-deep or bump and run, we convert the outside receivers to the fade route.

A lot of teams that you see playing two-deep coverage are going to sink their corners pretty well. They know they have the safeties behind them. They will let you throw the ball in front of them and then break on the football. Teams used to try to jam the wide receivers inside. If the defense gives us a cushion, we will still try to throw the hitch route inside.

I want to talk about another route that we got from the pros a couple of years ago. The reason we like this play is this: On the same routes that we run off our five steps, we wanted to be able to protect the quarterback against a good defensive front and still be able to run our best routes. We take the double-in; some people call it a dig route, but we are running it off the three-step drop. You could run this off any formation. We are going to slide our protection, so we could take care of anything on the weak side. As long as the defense rushes seven men, we are OK. We have everyone assigned to someone.

On the weak side we are going to run the same route that we ran on 181. We run the hitch on the back side. If they play two-deep, we are going to convert it to a fade route. Otherwise, we have a cinch hitch route that we can throw if the quarterback comes out and sees three-deep and does not like what he sees to the field side. That is not tough. He is going to run his three-step drop.

One thing we try to do with our quarterbacks when we are throwing to the left is this: We come out and put a lot of weight on the left instep. The reason for that is because we want the knees in a little. When you turn your body, you have a good pivot on the first step. When we take the second step, we start the pivot right now and then we throw the ball. We do not like to go back, 1, 2, 3, and then turn. We like to turn on the second step when we are throwing to the left.

We want the quarterback to find the throwing lane. He throws to the backside number. The bigger target you aim at, the more you are going to miss. We like to aim at a small target. If we are throwing an inside route, we like to throw at the receiver's teeth. If we miss his teeth, we hope to hit his head. If you can hit him in the head, you have a lot that can happen. Pick small targets. Don't just say, "Hit him in the numbers."
