Drabik published by Stadion Publishing Co. in Island Pond, Vermont. You can call and get the number. The book is 
Children in Sport Training. 
It tells you the age group that kids can do certain lifts. It is from the study done in the Soviet Union when they were picking their future Olympic athletes. The book is very easy to read. This book tells you at what age kids can start lifting heavy weights. Usually it is at the age of 17 to 18. That is why the medium load is 4 to 6 reps as fast as possible. Again, this is good for the high school players. That is why we do not squat max much.

We have a get-big program. One of the things we do is breathing squats. I trained with Wilbur Miller, who is 65 years old. He is still lifting, and he taught me these. Breathing squats, a set of 20, and you can't do 21. If you want a kid to get bigger, that will do it. It is because you are using so many big muscles for so many reps. Another way to do it is 10 sets of 10. That takes too long, because that is 100 reps. One set of 20 is enough.

When I was at Southern Cal, we opened with Memphis State, and they beat us at our place. After the game, our staff wanted to know what type of conditioning other teams were doing, because our guys got tired against Memphis. So I called about 20 of my friends in the business to see what they were doing conditioning-wise. We found out something that may surprise you. The first game of the season is not won by the best-conditioned team. 
It is won by the mostrested team. 
If you have a group of old kids, they can handle more work, because they have a bigger work capacity. It you have a group of young kids, they can't handle as much work. Just because you run them more does not mean that they are going to be in better shape. It just means you ran them more. This is where the question comes in, Are they ready or not? What we found was the fact that we needed to cut back the running drills 10 days before our first game. We will practice, but we do not do a lot of conditioning after that. You may agree or disagree. That is what we found. On Monday after that first game, we come back and start running again. We do our running on Monday and Tuesday.

This next part is our exercise rep schemes. It is straight from Soviet research. Generally, this is how it works. You make a bell curve: 5 reps, plus or minus 1. A third to one half of all of your reps are going to be 5s. The squats are 4, plus or minus 1. Snatch and cleans and the Olympic lifts will be 2, plus or minus 1. It is automatic.

Exercise Rep Schemes

Bench press: 5 ± 1; use all three methods.

Squats: 4 ± 1; use mainly number 2.

Snatches and cleans: 2 ± 1; use mainly number 2.

Anytime we start our running drills, we go tall, fall, and run. Why? It teaches posture. When I hit the position of leaning forward, I have to run or fall. We want to be tall. That first step is the important one. We want to get the foot on the ground quickly. If we are doing speed work, we start in the sprint stance. If we are doing football drills, we use the football stance.

We do what we call quick foot. We want the foot on the ground now. You cannot accelerate unless you are pushing.

We go out and do speed drills on Monday. We go tall, fall, and run 65 percent across the field. We walk 20 yards; go tall, fall and run 75 percent across the field; walk 20 yards; tall, fall, and run 85 percent across the field; and walk 20 yards. Then we either do one more or start on our five drills. If they are still tight, we will do another one.

The first of the five drills is hands; tall, fall, and run; hands. I want to see my hands. Are they doing the right thing? The next drill is hammer. I can't see it; I have to feel it. It is just like driving a nail. We are driving a nail, driving a nail.

The next drill is toe-up. This is a tough drill. We are standing there, and we tell them to feel their big toe.
