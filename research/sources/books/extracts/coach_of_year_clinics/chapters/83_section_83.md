If you are going to play defensive line at Ohio State, you have to get after it. Activity is important for us. From when the ball is snapped until the whistle blows, these guys better be busting it. We do two things to help our activity. We are going to be in great condition, and we are going to keep fresh people in the game. If we have guys of equal ability, we will substitute more. We tell them to go three plays all out, and then we bring in the next guy, who does his three plays. This year we had four great players before there was a drop-off in talent. We didn't play our 2s very much. We went with the 1s. They had to be in great physical shape and very disciplined to the ball. The game that won us the Big Ten championship came at Indiana. We had a defensive end get up off the ground, pursue to the other side of the field, pick up a fumble, and return it for a touchdown. He actually picked the fumble up off an Indiana player's back and returned it.

The evaluation of a coach is whether his players improve. I always got a little nervous if I had a player who wasn't better the second game than he was the first. If he doesn't improve as the season goes on, that comes back to the coach. If you are working that kid every day with reps and techniques, he should get better. I emphasize that we have to get better every game and our last game better be our best.

Repetition is the name of the game. The more you can rep it, the better you are going to be. It is monotonous and boring. We try to use different drills to break it up. Our guys must see a reach block a thousand times. They see the down block a thousand times. We do it a million times if they need it.

We feel that we have to do a great job with adjustment. We have to adjust during a game. I can remember two games in my coaching career where we didn't do a good job of adjusting, and we lost the game. After we saw the film, it was too late. We have to adjust in advance in the game.

We were fortunate this year. We had guys who were students of the game. If they were not in class, they were watching tape of the opponents or their drill work. There is no excuse for missed assignments. I've been places where we had to prod those guys to get them to watch tape. They have to execute. They have to know what their assignment is and execute it. There is zero tolerance for making a mental mistake. I've never heard Coach Pagac yell at a guy for making a physical mistake, as long as it was aggressive.

Football is not going to be all good. You are going to have some adversity. Some things are going to go wrong during the course of a game. The last thing I need are guys coming off the field complaining. Against Purdue the first two times they had the ball, they threw two bombs. It was 0-14 before we knew it. I've been around some teams when things started to get hairy and panic set in. That is where I give Coach Pagac and Coach Cooper credit. They didn't panic. We had three quarters to play.

One of the biggest distractions you can have is players playing for you who are always in trouble. When I get together with my players, I tell them, "Here is the policy. I don't set them. They are Coach Cooper's policies. I work for him, these are his policies, and you are going to follow them. If you don't want to follow them, you don't play." You get that ironed out at the beginning. If not you can have a coach-player problem when you have a game coming up. You don't need those distractions.

The last thing is this. I expect you to win and be excellent. If you want the same thing, then we will always be on the same page. You always have players who think that you are on them all the time. Just have them look at this philosophy. If they don't want the same thing, I'll get off them, but they won't play.

The next thing I want to do is go through what I call "10 vital techniques." If you are going to be a good defensive lineman, you better be able to do these 10 things. Number one, and probably the toughest thing to do, is stance. Stance is number one in my opinion. You have to get in a good football stance. We start
