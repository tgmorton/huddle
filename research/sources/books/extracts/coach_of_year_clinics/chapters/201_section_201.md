from all five teams was "no one." The most important play in the game is the punt, and no one coaches it. That doesn't make sense to me. They told me that the punters kind of coached themselves. Every day, I spend at least an hour with our punter. That is prepractice, during practice, and after practice. I film every time that he punts the ball. I film two angles. I film from behind and the top. He watches those films every day. I want him to understand in the game if I say, "Drop the ball."

When the punter kicks a bad kick in a game, he does one of two things. He goes over and hangs his head, or he wants to know what happened. You, as the coach, better have something to tell him. You can teach yourself how to coach punters just by watching film.

If the hips are turned to the right or left, the first thing that happens when I step is that my foot is going in the direction of my hips. All of a sudden, my hips are pointing to the right, and I want to kick it to the left. That means I have to slice the ball.

I want the conventional style, where the punter strikes the ball and his foot finishes above his head. I want that finish on the right eye with his foot above his head. That is why I take the film from the top. If I don't see his foot above his head, I know he did not finish the kick. If I see his foot to the left of his shoulder or below, that means he had some bad steps, and his plant foot and body were turned.

To get your punter kicking down the field, draw a chalk line down the field. Just simply make him step down the line. He is stepping down the line and kicking down the line. We want his foot right on that chalk line. If you don't want to use the chalk line, put him in a tunnel. Form a tunnel with dummies or cones. If you have a punter who is crossing over, he will kick the dummies. That will get him out of crossing over more quickly than you know. If you have a punter who is overstriding, pile dummies up in front of him. However, watch him. They want to stop and jerk their knee up when you do that.

There are two drills that I want to show you really quickly. The first drill is called the seat drill. The punter

is on his knees. You can't do this enough. I make our punters do this a thousand times. Have a manager or another punter spin him the ball. The punter catches the ball, seats it, and drops it. They present the ball and drop it. I don't want him to fart around with the ball. The more he adjusts and fiddles with the ball, the less likely he will be a quick kicker. As a punter, you are trying to get your time between 1.3 to 1.5 seconds. I time the punter from the time he catches it until it comes off his foot. If it comes off in 1.6 to 1.7 seconds, the kick is going to get blocked.

During pregame, I watch the opponent's snapper and punter. That is when I decide what we are going to do in punt receiving. I watch the center to see how he presents the ball. I watch the punter to see if he can get it off in 1.5. I check to see how many steps he is taking. I look at the distance it takes him to kick the ball. Most punters are 15 yards deep. If the punter takes more than 5 yards to punt the ball, it will be blocked just about anytime they want to come after it. We can't protect it. That is where I put the dummies to keep the punter from overstepping the 5-yard mark. If the punter can't get the kick off before the 5-yard point, the block point is 7 instead of 9 yards. Even if he can get it off in 2.0 seconds, it will be blocked.

In the seat drill, the punter catches the ball. He grips the ball and presents it. He then drops the ball. If he drops the ball correctly, it will bounce straight up and back to his right. If the nose of the ball is down, it will bounce back to the punter. If the nose of the ball is up, it will go away from the punter. If the ball is turned one way or the other, it will bounce the opposite way from how it is turned. He is not kicking the ball; he can practice these things, and you don't have to be there.

The other drill is called the flex drill. I do this to get the players to understand how to explode through the
