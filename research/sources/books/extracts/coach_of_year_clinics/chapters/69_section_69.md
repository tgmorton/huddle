There are two things that I absolutely insist on in practice. One is concentration, and the other is intensity. Your players cannot improve or get better unless they concentrate. The thing that gets to me quicker than anything is a guy going through the motions and not paying attention. We are not on a clock in our practice, but we demand concentration. We have coaches who will not let anything go by.

We want our players to be intense and play hard every play. There is nothing new about that. But you are not going to get it done without it. We play one down at a time and play it hard.

Our whole approach has been one of consistency and execution. It doesn't matter whether we look great or terrible on Saturday. I do the same thing on Monday. We have done it that way for years. I will be a little more upset if we have lost. But I don't bring guys back and scrimmage them or bench them. I try not to do anything differently. I don't know if that is all that important, but that is the way I do it.

What is important is execution. We don't do a whole lot of things differently today than we have been doing for the last 15 or 20 years. I'm going to take a couple of plays and show you what we have done with them. One of our lead plays is the same pass route we have been running for the last 20 years. The very first day we go out for spring practice, we will start out with "69, 66, and 62." We have been doing that for years. If we have had any key to what we do, it is in the area of execution. By the time a player gets to play for us, he knows what is expected of him.

It is amazing to me that we still see teams that almost change from week to week. If they continue to change too often, you won't see them around too long. If they continue to change, that staff will be gone, and someone else will be in there.

We have some basic ideas. Our pass protection is the key to everything we do. If the front is odd, we are in a man-blocking scheme. If it is an even front, we zone-block. There are always changes to the rules, but that is pretty basic for us. We always want to block "big on big." By that, I mean linemen blocking linemen and backs blocking on linebackers whenever possible. We always block weak on a 4-4 front.

We have a lot of different sets. We go from two backs, I backs, one back, and a lot of different things. What the defense does and what their tendencies have been are how we determine how to utilize our backs. Basically, we release the flanker, split end, and tight end all the time. At times, we may leave our tight end in to block if we flood the weak side. We have had such great tight ends over the last few years that we have gotten away from leaving him in.

When we come to the line, the center will block weak when he is not covered. That way, we may be able to get the back out to the weak side. I'm not going to get into the protection too much, but if the inside linebacker comes, we base-block. If the outside linebacker comes, we slide. If we don't know what they are doing, we double-read it. Some of this I may try to get back to, depending on the time.

In the individual technique of pass blocking, there are some important things. When the lineman comes out of his stance, he jab-steps to the inside. We always protect the inside first. We honor an inside fake. We never honor an outside fake. The offensive line coach studies the moves of the opponents we play and works with our linemen.

It is important to anticipate but not be overanxious. One of the hardest things to teach an offensive lineman is not to fire out, lunge, or get overanxious. The hands come up, not out. The knees are bent, and the buttocks are lowered. That is hard for the offensive lineman. An offensive lineman has to slide with his feet, never cross over, and never take big steps. They hit and recoil. Their shoulders are square at all times to the line of scrimmage. They deliver a blow and get separation. The defense wants to get a hold of the offensive lineman and get his shoulders turned. Once that happens, he can do anything he wants.

In training and developing our quarterback, we don't fool around with his throwing motion. If you have a young guy and are starting out with him, you can have
