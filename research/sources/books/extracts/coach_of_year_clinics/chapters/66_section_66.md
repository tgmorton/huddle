the time, but we made 50 percent of our interceptions while we were in this coverage. We don't like to play this coverage because it doesn't fit the style of defense we run.

We line up the same way every time in the secondary. That is the way we disguise our coverage. Our tempo changer is the blitz. We blitz the hell out of people. The best blitz we have is when we bring these guys. We also run a "double dog." That has been good to us. We also like to bring the Raider and Will linebacker off the weak side. When you bring four rushers weak, it presents a problem for the offense. When we bring both of these guys, the Mike linebacker picks up 4, the Sam linebacker takes 3, the safety takes 2, and the corners have 1 and 5.

I've covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, but I believe that is a pretty simple method. That is not what wins for you. I understand that. You have to be able to block and tackle. I don't think we have any problem lining up correctly. We are never outflanked.

We don't have any problems with motion or flipflopping or any gimmick. When we play a twins team, we put both our corners to the same side. We match up wide receivers on corners. We can still play hard corners and have the Raider backing them up.

We have a circuit we do in practice. We have five stations with 10 guys at each station. The first station works on recovering fumbles. It is not a picking-themup drill, it is recovering them. We do all kinds of fumble drills. We do that for a minute and 30 seconds.

The second station is a one-man strip drill: one ball carrier and one tackler. The tackler is working on stripping the arms away from the ball.

The third station is working on catching the football. They are running tip drills and every ball-handling drill you can think of. We work on intercepting the ball. Everyone does it, from the tackles up.

The fourth station is a two-man strip drill. The first man tackles and strips. The second man comes in and clubs the crap out of the ball. If the ball comes loose, the first guy who made the tackle picks it up and scores. These types of things happen every Saturday.

The last station is helmet on the ball. We stick the ball with our helmet. If the ball comes out, we pick it up and run with it.

Coaches are the luckiest guys in the world. We are the last frontier. If you don't enjoy and love kids and really love coaching, you need to quit. You can make more money driving a Greyhound bus. We have the greatest profession in the world. I coached a long time, and the greatest thrill I have is to see the guys I've coached go into the coaching profession. That makes you feel good. Today in the United States of America people won't try to be a doctor because they are afraid they will fail. They are scared to become a coach because they don't think they can do it.
