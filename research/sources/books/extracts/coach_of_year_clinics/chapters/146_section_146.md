he closes down and spills all blocks outside. Since he is charging from the outside, the only release that the tight end has is an inside release. If that happens, he jams him, reverses his hips, and gets to an inside-out trail position on the tight end.

In the straight I formation, the Mike and Buck linebackers key the fullback. We are showing a twodeep or quarter-shell coverage. The offense doesn't know which way the safeties are going. The safeties key the tailback. If the fullback takes on the Mike linebacker, Mike takes him on in the B gap with an inside-out charge. The Buck linebacker flows to the inside hip of Mike. If pass comes, he is the hole player on the inside. If run comes, he is the cutback player. The same thing would happen if the fullback attacked the Buck linebacker. Mike now would be the cutback player and inside hole player on the pass.

Both safeties key the tailback. If he goes left, the right safety goes to the post, and the left safety comes to support. The offense didn't know which side we were spooking to, and we always had the extra player on flow. The hardest thing to teach and get accomplished is the linebackers overrunning the ball on the cutback. It is a sound defense against the option. The support safety is the pitch player, and the post safetyafter he checks the postis the alley player.

If the offense comes out in a twins set, it is an identify in itself. We play it just like the last coverage. The linebackers key the fullback. The two safeties key the tailback. The Willie linebacker has the tight end. The problem is whether the Willie linebacker can cover the tight end. We did it this year. The kid we had doing it was not a great athlete but a smart kid and knew the difference between a high-hat release and a block release. He has help from the linebacker in the hole and the free safety.

If a team came out in a pro set with the tailback set in the weak halfback position, we made adjustments to that. We taught that the offset back is the most dangerous pass receiver. Basically, we are in sky support to the right, the difference being that the safety is man on the offset back. The Buck and Mike linebackers are on the remaining back.

If the offense came out in a pro set with the strong set, we would play it exactly like the weak set. The only difference is that we would never buzz in the scarlet key. The right safety takes the strong back, and the left safety is free.
