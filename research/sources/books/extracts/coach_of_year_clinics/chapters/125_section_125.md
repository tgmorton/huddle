Goal-Line Offense

Mt. Carmel High School, Illinois

Thank you. I appreciate all of you being here; believe me, I do. I will tell you, I do not have time for any jokes. I want to get right to teaching about football.

One thing we try to get across to our players is this. We talk to teach; we listen to learn. We teach this to our kids in school, in football, and we should keep this point in mind this weekend as well. How do we learn? There are basically three ways we learn. We learn through the people we meet, we learn through the books we read, and we learn through the tapes we watch or listen to. Those are the three basic ways in which we learn.

This weekend they will have a clinic manual available. Invest in the clinic manual. It is a great manual and will contain articles you can learn from. A magazine I brought with me is excellent. It is the 
American Football Quarterly 
It is put out by a man who played for Bear Bryant at Alabama. I think the magazine runs about $20 per year. It is the best magazine of its kind that I have seen or read. You can call those people up and tell them you heard about it from me. I do not have anything invested in the magazine, but I would like to see it continue. Their number is 1-800-537-4271. Keep in mind the three ways we learn. Go buy books on how to teach, how to learn, business, and leadership. Make yourself a better teacher, and you will automatically make yourself a better coach.

This is what we try to get across to our staff: We are going to achieve whatever we emphasize. I coach our offensive line. We emphasize coming off the ball low, hard, and quick. We emphasize having great splits in our line. We emphasize taking care of the little things. Keep this point in mind. As coaches, we are going to achieve whatever we emphasize. If we make it important to the kids, it will become second nature to them as we go along. Teach your kids to play the game with their feet and their eyes. You do not have to have great speed, but if you have great feet, you can play the game. We tell our players it is just like a car accident: speed kills.

We want to be great technicians. We want our kids to be great technique players. We have had some great athletes. However, we have had some kids who have developed into great technique players. We want to develop leaders in our program.

We have players all over the country who will be team captains next year. We have had some great players come out of our program. Some of you may have heard of Simeon Rice, who was the third player taken in the NFL draft last year. He came to Mt. Carmel as a running back. He did not even want to play defense. We talked him into playing defense, and now he is worth a lot of money. The point I am making is that you can have players with ability, but you still have to coach them and teach them.

I am going to talk about goal-line offense. If you are going to be a good football team, you better be good with your special teams. Think about the amount of time you spend on special teams. We spend four days a week, from 15 to 30 minutes a day, working on our special teams. To win, we know we must play great defense. From 1988 to 1991, we were in four straight state championships. We went 10 consecutive quarters in the state championship play without giving up a point. We finally gave up a touchdown because our offense turned the ball over. The point is that you have to emphasize all of those areas to be a good football team.

The things that I want to talk about today are not just X's and O's. My total topic is goal-line offense: theory, concepts, and practice. It is important to know how to practice on the goal line as well. First, I want to go over our overall offensive philosophy. Our offense is based on execution. We want to do something our athletes can do, as opposed to something they can't
