If the offense comes out with a twin set and breaks the tailback into a wide-receiver position away from the set, the strong safety takes the break. The corners take the wide receivers. The free safety is free in the middle. The Mike and Buck linebackers take the remaining back.

If they came out in what we called a buckeye set, which is a three-wide-receivers set, we made another adjustment. We put both corners on the wide receivers and the strong safety on the third receiver. The free safety was in the middle. We gave them a three-deep look. If we played a team that played a lot of this type of personnel grouping, we would pull our strong safety out of the game and put in another corner. If the third receiver is a tight-end split-out, we would leave the strong safety in the game. We pulled the Willie linebacker off the line and put him in a stack position behind the defensive end. The linebacker makes a trio call. All linebackers are in stack positions. The three linebackers are playing trio coverage on the two remaining backs. The linebackers are fast-flowing. If there is action toward Willie linebacker, he is in an outside-in attitude. The Mike linebacker blows the B gap to the Willie side. The Buck linebacker blows the A gap away from the Willie linebacker. On action the other way, the Buck linebacker is in the stack. The Mike linebacker blows the A gap, and Willie hangs back for the cutback. That particular defense helped us a lot against both run teams and pass teams.

Any time a team took the tight end out of the game, we came after the quarterback. We felt that they had shortened the distance to the quarterback.

Against snake, the two tights and one back, we want our Willie linebacker on the worst pass-receiving tight end. The call linebacker makes the call to the Willie, and Willie makes the stud call. The free safety kicks the other way, and the remaining back is taken by the Mike and Buck linebackers. We are gap-sound against the run, sound against pass, and in an excellent position on all option games.

If the offense comes out in con grouping, two tight ends and two running backs, they are doing it for a reason. Very few teams come out in this set to throw the ball. We make one of three calls. We play tight defense, Bear, or Ohio, or we substitute in the defense. The coverage will be 10 zone or man free. They are going to try to play smash mouth with us. We want to get people in gaps and people running downhill at them. When we played scarlet key coverage against the con, we matched the strong safety up on the second pass-receiving tight end. The free safety and boundary corner keyed the tailback. Mike and Buck took the fullback.

If we played our Ohio or 46 defense against the con package, we would give a left or right call to get our personnel in the proper places. We put the boundary-side corner and the free safety in the safety positions and backed them off the ball. They keyed the tailback. The Mike linebacker had the fullback. The strong safety and Buck had coverage on the two tight ends. The strong safety handled all breaks in the formation, and the Buck linebacker handled all tight-end adjustments.

We have a dog call that we worked with our scarlet key. We game-planned what we were going to do. If the offense was a straight I formation, the dog call tells us that one of our linebackers is blitzing. We don't know which linebacker it is going to be until they show
