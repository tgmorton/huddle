makes you think they are going to stop you now? The defense is going to take more risk than before. You must be prepared for these risks. The better you can take care of those risks, the better it is for your offense. We sell our receivers, just like everyone else, that we play all year to get a one-on-one situation. "Now you are going to have it for sure."

The difference in college football now and, say, five years ago is the fact that teams now are playing a lot more press coverage. They are playing more of a sic 'em type defense than it used to be. An example of that is Nebraska. Two of the last three years, they have won the national championship. They went from the completely zone, high-tech read, straight-up eagle defense to now a 4-3 defense with the Mike and Will linebackers walked up tight. They move them in and out. They bump and run on the corners. It is like everything in football. When you win as Nebraska has, everyone starts copying them. A lot of other teams are using what Nebraska does. You can run that defense if you have corners outside that can cover one on one on the perimeter.

We feel that we know what the defense is going to do once we get to the red zone now. Conversely, some teams have gotten to the point where they play more zone coverage in the red zone. They just make you beat them. If you have not scored a lot of points on them, they may play seven across on 3rd and 5 on the 5-yard line and rush four men. All of that is hypothetical that we could get into. You could say what you run, and I could tell you what I run. I am not into those aspects. I am not going to get into that today. All I am going to talk about is some philosophy of using some routes that are multifaceted that will take care of some different things.

We want to make sure our quarterback and receivers are on the same page. Our quarterback coach and receivers coach work a lot of time together against air. We are going to have to read what the defense is doing. You cannot come in after playing in front of 87,000 fans and have the receiver say, "I thought the free safety was playing cover two." The quarterback says, "I thought he was playing bump and run, man." That is when everyone wants to know who is the damn coach? That is not going to get the job done. You are looking for results. The way you do that is to coach them up hard, and basically it gets down to this: Estimate the defense's intent. What can he play from the alignment he is in? You hear a lot about teams disguising their coverage. Let me tell you something. When the band is playing on Friday night and the offense is knocking on the goal line, they are not going to be disguising anything. The are going to be covering as best as they can. If they can do a lot of fancy things on the goal line, that is great for them. To me this is just a lot of clinic talk. ''I want you to line up in an outside shade, then jump inside, and on the snap I want you to come up, then make sure you play cover two." Hey, do you think that kid is thinking about all of that? He is thinking about that war daddy running right past his butt. You have to be careful about giving the other team too much credit. The question we want to ask is this: What can they do from the way they line up? We try to react from that point on.

What we would like to do, to keep from adjusting any more than we have to, is to eliminate a possible bad play. It is like I said about taking a risk. We want to make sure we are on the same page.

The bottom line would be for you to come to our practices this spring, and we could show you what we do. We run what we call a "man-zone read." If they are playing man coverage, we are going to do 
this. 
If they are playing zone coverage, we are going to do 
that. 
This is particular with the inside receiver, whether it is the tight end in the two-wide-receiver offense or the slot in a three-wide-receiver set. We are going to run some type of read route based on the coverage. If the defense is in a three-deep coverage and we have a man coming down the field, he will continue to try to split the middle to work on that area. If it is against a three-deep and the safety is deep, the receiver will hook up. We do not want to run into a three-deep.

If the receiver is running what we call a shallow route, which is a short crossing route, and he sees man coverage, he drives up the field one more step, he gets
