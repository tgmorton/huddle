acceleration and power with your feet out to the side. We start them running. When I yell "touch," they touch their hands to the ground then. They don't run two or three steps and then touch. In a game, your reaction is not when you want it. It is when it occurs. On defense, you have to gain ground on every move. After the touch, they come out low, hard, and accelerating. When a player comes out high, he is not gaining ground. Whatever drill you do, make sure they are gaining ground on the first step. I don't tell them to go. They touch and go.

Every day we do stance-and-starts. We put them in their stance and make them come out low and hard. We tell them which foot to move first. We emphasize elbows in tight and pumping. We are looking for explosion.

We do a grass drill to teach players how to fall. If you feel yourself fall, what do you do? You put your hands down to break your fall. If you fall and want to get up quickly, you use your and hands and feet. We teach our kids how to fall. You have to get up on the way down. We do this drill. They start to chop their feet. I say, "hit." They hit the ground, get their hands and feet under them, and come up running. Make them get up and down two to three times and make them tackle to finish the drill. This is the second-effort drill. How many times have you seen guys come off the ground to make tackles, sacks, or recover fumbles? I've seen it lots. If a guy can't give us a second move, he can't play for us.

We use this drill for linebackers and down linemen. The first way we teach this drill is in an up position. We teach them how to slide and change directions. You have to be able to defeat the low block. If you can defeat the low block, you can beat the high block. If you are playing the high block and the low block comes, you can't beat the low block because your legs are split. You cannot shed the low blocker. The feet have to stay under the hips at all times. If the feet get outside the hips, the player can't make a second move. If he keeps his feet under his hips, he can go right, left, forward, or backward. The knees have to be bent, and the back foot must be active in the slide. In the change-of-direction drill, the toes have to remain straight ahead. If the toes turn, the shoulders turn. We want the pads parallel. We have three guys in the drill. There are six guys behind them in what we call the bull pen. They are practicing the drill. They are moving their arms and practicing. I say, "switch," and the second line becomes the first line and continues the drill. The third line moves up and practices while they wait for the next "switch" call. You don't become a better player by standing around.

The next drill is the lateral run. We don't slide our feet, we cross over. We don't want a big, wide step. It is a short movement like a carioca step. We keep our toes straight up the field as we cross our feet. My butt is low, and my knees are bent. If we turn our feet, the shoulders turn also. We can't shed anybody or change directions if our shoulders and feet are turned. Don't let them rise up when they change directions. If you do, you will get beat. When your eyes see something, they don't tell you to rise up.

This next drill is not a good drillit is a great drill. We do it every day. We have two long, flat dummies. We have two guys facing each other. One guy is going to his right, and one is going left. They have their hands on the dummies. They slide up and down the dummies. While they are sliding up and down the dummies, they can't take their hands off that bag. When they get to the end of the dummies. They turn and sprint. You can do the same thing with a board instead of a dummy. The main thing is to make them move laterally and keep their hands down.

We take the drill one step further. We have an offensive player and a defensive player. They do the same drill, but as they get to the end of the bag, the offensive player tries to cut the defensive player with a low block. The blocker is trying to get to the knees of the defensive player. The defensive player has to keep his hands down and shed the blocker. If the defensive player gets to the end of the dummy and rises up, he is blocked. We work on movement, shedding, and keeping down. We slide down with the toes straight and then cross over with the toes straight, always keeping our hands on the bags. It makes them bend their knees and stay down.
