being yelled at by a 40-year-old coach holding up a card and telling them to ''run this play.'' That is not much of a tryout or a look. By having a JV program, we feel we can develop some talent. We can bring them in, set them aside, put them on another field, and let them learn our system. They will play the four games in October. At the end of that season, the JV coaches will make recommendations, and we will bring 25 to 30 up to the varsity level.

At that point, we have our 85 players practicing in the fall. Because we have low numbers of players, we have to use a lot of players who are twos to run the cardteam plays. Toward the end of the year, they are not enthusiastic about doing that. At the end of the season, those JVs are excited because they can show the varsity coaches what they can do. It is a good system. We used it for five years at Valdosta State and it helped us win a championship. This past season, our starting strong safety, our starting center, our punt-return man, and one of our key backup receivers were all scholarship players who were walk-ons when they were freshmen and had come up through the junior varsity. It allowed us to fill in those scholarships that we lose when we have to put someone off the team for discipline or a player does not make his grades. This gives us a pool of talent that we can draw from. We need the high school coaches here to help us on this. We can't go out and recruit walk-ons. You can tell your players that they will get a fair look at the University of Kentucky with our JV program if they want to walk on.

I want to show a video of our games last year so that you can see what we are doing on offense. We only have four running plays. The lead has always been the best running play for us. We like corner routes a lot, and we coach them a bunch. Notice that our offensive linemen are in a two-point stance a lot. I think you can see what we are doing. [Video]

Next, I want to talk about our offensive philosophy. We came up with this in 1986, when I was the head coach at Copperas Cove High School in Texas. We had 1500 students in our school. They had won 14 games in 10 years. The next smallest school that we had on our schedule had over 2000 students. We were outmanned. On top of that, all of our kids lived around Ft. Hood. At that time it was the largest military base in the free world. We would get the kids in the ninth grade on up. We came up with this philosophy. We had seen Brigham Young University use this system, and it worked. We felt if we could teach this to high school students, we could teach it to anyone. We did it as an experiment, and it worked out. We have been doing it ever since. Our one basic statement about our philosophy would be this: Throw the short pass as many times as possible to people who score.

In the three years at Copperas Cove, we won 14 games. We beat four schools that the school had never beaten. We made the kids and the community proud of the program. We did not win the championship, basically because we were outmanned. In three years we had one Division I football player to sign a scholarship. By comparison, most of the schools we played against signed four or five Division I players per year.

We told our players that we could not do a lot of things well. We were not very big, and we did not have a lot of numbers. We convinced our kids that we could do this: We could throw the ball better than anyone in the state of Texas. The kids got excited about it. We did everything we could to promote that concept. We did it over and over again in terms of promotion and talking about it. We tried to pick out of our younger grades the skilled people. You can find them if you will look.

When we were at Copperas Cove, we had to coach both sides of the ball. Mike Majors, who is our defensive coordinator, coached our offensive line at Copperas Cove. He helped develop a lot of this offense. We just talked about these skilled people all of the time. We wanted to know who the players were who came along who could score. Who were the guys who were coming along who had a knack for scoring?

We identified the players who we felt could score. Then we put them in a position to score. If you looked at what they were doing at BYU and what we had been doing as an I formation and option coach through the years in Texas, you could see the similarities. All we were ever trying to do was to take the kid who had a
