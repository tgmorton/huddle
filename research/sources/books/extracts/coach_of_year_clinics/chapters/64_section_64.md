If we call a "31 solid," the defensive end would be in a 6 technique, and the Sam linebacker is in a 9 technique. If we called an "11 hammer," the defensive end is in a 9 technique, and the Sam linebacker is in a 6 technique off the ball. If we called a "22 wide," the Sam linebacker lines up in a 7 technique off the ball, and the defensive end lines up in a true 8 position.

On the split-end side we are playing an outside linebacker 3 yards outside and 3 yards deep. The weakside defensive end is playing a loose 5 technique on the offensive tackle.

Our Mike linebacker is the A or B gap player. He is the toughest linebacker we have. He has common sense. He has to cover the fullback and tight end sometimes. You can get by with an average guy with good intelligence who understands the game. He is an old-fashioned inside linebacker.

Last year, the leading tackler on our team was the left end. He only weighed 212 pounds. The reason he was playing there was that we didn't have anyone who weighed any more who was any better. He ran a 4.5 forty, which helped him. You can play a guy here who is small but can run. This next year we can move him to linebacker because we have two bigger ends that can run.

Our Sam linebacker was a 193-pound high school tailback. He started 43 football games at Texas Tech playing in front of tight ends. He is one heck of a football player. He has to play pass defense and rush the passer. But the big thing is that he has to play against the run.

The Will linebacker has to be a pretty good football player. He has to run pretty well also. He has to cover the tailback on passes and a fourth receiver vertical in some cases. He has to play the run some. He fills the lanes on the cutbacks. Ours is about 210 pounds.

The outside linebacker is called the "Raider linebacker." Since we are the Red Raiders, our rover is called a Raider. This guy here is a good football player. He is a secondary player who is tough enough to play against the run. We can get guys for these positions. If they are big enough but don't have enough speed to play the corner, they can play here. We can get personnel to fill these positions. That is how we pick the front eight people in our defense. Our tackles are just leftovers. That's where we play the principal's son. If nothing else, just put them in a gap, and tell them to submarine and tie up two players.

Everything we do on defense is based on two or three things. We are a gap-control defense, so let's start out in a regular "22." We want all 11 guys to key the football. That is the first key. The next key is whether the ball is on or off the line of scrimmage. The third thing is whether the ball is toward or away from our position. The fourth thing is the speed the ball is moving. That is called the tempo of the ball. Everything we do on defense is based on those things.

One hundred years ago when I played football, the middle linebacker had the first threat coming into the line of scrimmage. Our Mike linebacker has A gap on flow to him. If the ball goes away from him, he pursues and takes the first threat off the line of scrimmage. On flow away from the Will linebacker, he has the first cutback threat. If the ball is tossed to the tailback on a sweep, the tempo of the play is fast. If the ball is handed off, the tempo is a little slower. That is how we decide on what speed to pursue the ball. If the ball is away from me on the line, I chase it down the line. If the ball is away from me off the line, I chase it off the line. If it is fast, I go fast. If it is slow, I slow down. That is what tempo is all about. You can't coach defensive football if your team doesn't understand tempo. We work on this all the time. That is the reason we run to the ball so well.

If you knew whether they were going to run or pass, it would make your job easier. Somebody on the offensive line is going to tell you. We think we know
