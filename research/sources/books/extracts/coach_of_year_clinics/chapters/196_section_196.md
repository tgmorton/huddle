linebacker. It is the same steps as our sprint draw. The aiming point is the outside leg of the tight guard. From there, the tailback runs to daylight.

When the tailback sees seven in the box instead of six in the box, he knows there is no cutback for him. The play becomes a strictly play-side run. We have to leave one guy unblocked. We leave the man who is the farthest away from the point of attack.

The play to the weak side looks like the schemes we ran with the sprint draw to the weak side. They are primarily the same play.

The outside play from this set is the toss sweep. We crack on the inside linebacker with our slot receiver. We reach and overblock with our line. The fullback blocks on the support. The tailback flow-steps as he did on the downhill play, but he is trying to get wide on this play. There is no tight end, therefore there is no read. This is a full-fledged sweep to the sideline. The tight guard is overblocking on the inside linebacker. If the linebacker runs through, the guard blocks him. If he doesn't, the slot back cracks him. The wide receiver three-step-reads the corner. If it is a hard corner, he blocks him. If the corner retreats, he cracks the strong safety.

I'm out of time, but I would like to show one pass before I go. Our goal every year is to average 200 yards rushing. As you can see, we don't have many plays. We run sprint draw, isolation, sweep, and the reverses off those plays. Our goal in the passing game is 250 yards. We are trying to get to 450 yards of total offense. If we can minimize turnovers, we can win most games. The big thing that we are doing out of the I is the sprint-draw pass. We had Bill Parcells down for a visit about 10 years ago. I asked him, If he could run only one pass against all defenses in pro ball, what would it be? This is what he showed us.

This play has been outstanding for us for years. People call this a dig route. The tight end releases upfield at 10 yards and works inside off the linebacker. If it is man coverage, he separates from him. If it is zone, he finds the open area. The outside receiver runs the same pattern at 16 yards. The fullback blocks as if he is running the sprint draw. The tailback fakes and comes through the line. He runs an out at 3 yards.

The quarterback sets 9.5 to 10 yards behind the tight guard. We want the linemen to keep their pads square. It is not a turn protection. The linemen must remain square as long as they can.

If the free safety comes up on the 16-yard dig or 12-yard tight end's pattern, we are going downtown. We try to hit the post cut to the split end. If the free safety hangs deep, we come to the strong-side linebacker area. If the linebacker flies out of there, we deal the football to the tight end right now. If that window is closed, we look for the 16-yard pattern. That pattern takes a little longer to run. If it is not open, we go to the last read, which is the back in the flat.
