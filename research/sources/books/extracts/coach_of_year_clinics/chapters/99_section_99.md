about the upcoming season. We try to get them excited. I bring out the equipment and tell them how much it cost.

We send them two newsletters, one in the summer before practice starts and one at the end of the season. In the first letter we tell them what they need to do to get ready for the season. I tell them about camp and what we have planned for the year.

Let me talk about practice organization. Many of you have asked me about our practice schedule that coordinates both the JV and varsity together into one practice.

1. JV and varsity practice together. They do the same drills and use the same terminology, same plays, and the same coaching staff for the last four years.

2. The JVs exist for the sole purpose of developing players for the varsity. If a player develops rapidly while on the JVs, he may be called up anytime during the season or postseason. We are not trying to win the JV championship. That is not our goal, but if we do, it is a bonus.

3. Our practice is split up. We designate one side of the field as offensive and the other side as the defensive side.

4. Everything in practice has to be a progression. Everything should logically build on the preceding principle or concept that you were teaching before. At Campbell, we feel that practice is one of the most important aspects of our program.

5. Our practices come down to these four principles:

a. Organization. Based on scouting information, every adjustment and contingency imaginable will be covered. Every minute of practice will be used wisely. All coaches are responsible for completing the teaching within the required time. If it is a 10-minute period, then it is the coach's responsibility to teach the material in that time frame. Be overprepared. Team morale is achieved when your players truly feel they are prepared.

b. Performance. Simulate playing conditions. Don't do nonsense drills that just take up time. Be sure that they have a specific purpose and that each player is given the chance to perform his fundamentals, techniques, and assignments as a football player. Be sure the things that are important to you in August are still important to you in November. Always stress fundamentals and techniques.

c. Precision. Again, everything that we will be doing in the game will be practiced precisely. If we want to add three plays on a given day and we are incapable of doing it precisely, then we practice just the one or two plays that we were able to get in, and we will do those precisely. When we beat Kailua with 19 seconds remaining on homecoming, it was not a desperation pass from Kaleopa to Acidera that won it, but it was a play that had been rehearsed and practiced time and time again. Everyone knew exactly where they had to be. If you are not performing your plays precisely during practice, then you will not perform them precisely during the game.

d. Evaluation. If you do not evaluate and constantly upgrade your practices, you will never know what your problems are or how to fix them. Analyze and rate your practices. Film them if possible. Coaches need to give input about what they feel is working and not working. Every coach needs to know exactly what his role is and what he has to do next. Coaches should meet every day after practice to go over what has happened at practice. Are we doing too much of this? Not enough of that? Are we too negative? Are we too soft? What can we do better? This process may be the most important aspect of practice.

6. To us, enthusiasm is a prerequisite. Our coaches are very vocal, but not in the negative sense. They are constantly encouraging the players and are on top of things. We will not tolerate anything less than the players' best efforts and are always ready to encourage or pick them up with encouraging words.
