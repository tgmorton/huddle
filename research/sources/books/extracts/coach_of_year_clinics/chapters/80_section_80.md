soft zone, the play goes to the tailback. This is not a "Hail Mary" play. The wideouts run 20-yard go routes, but we are not trying to throw the bomb. We are trying to get a stretch against a three-deep scheme. If it is against man-to-man, we are looking for a mismatch. As I said, if it is against a really soft zone, the best bet is to dump the ball to the tailback on the F delay. If it is man-to-man, the tailback has to break one way or the other. He has a choice to go right or left on the break.

F DELAY

We would designate one of the two tight ends or the H back, if he is in the slot, to break to the middle of the field. He would break to the open spot against a two-deep scheme. If it is man, it becomes a footrace. If we have swinger called, the wideouts run a comeback route.

I am going to add my favorite pass play of all times. This will be my 25th year of coaching. I have always liked the curl-flat route. As a quarterback, when I played, I felt it was the easiest pass to read for the quarterback. You get a stretch to the flat, and you have someone in the middle who can work back to the quarterback. It is an easy throw. You do not have to have a strong arm to throw the ball. It is not a big timing route. I have always been a big fan of the curl-flat route. Kay Dalton put in a little different wrinkle on the play. I am sure some of you have used this, but I had never used it. We call the play "Hank." Our tight end hooks up over the ball at 8 yards. The wideouts run a curl at 16 yards. We get our fullback on the stretch route to the flat. The tailback sets to block and then runs a scat route. It is six-man protection.

Hank Pass Route

Our quarterback comes back on a five-step drop, and our tight end runs the 8-yard curl right in front of the quarterback. He sits in between the linebackers. If it is against a 4-3, he will try to get away from the middle linebacker. The quarterback takes a five-step drop, and if the end is open, it shows right now. If the tight end is open, we get him the ball. It is an easy throw.

The defense will sit on the tight end. Now we go to our curl-flat read. Most quarterbacks want to throw the ball down the field. Most defenses will play the deep route and give you the short or flat area. You have to throw to the flat area until the defense takes it away.

The only way that the defense can take all three receivers away on the strong side is to come hard with the blitz with tight coverage. If we see the Mike coming hard, we will work the back side of Hank. The defense will be short on the back side if they are playing zone. I like the play because it shows early, and it is a relatively easy pass to throw.

Now I want to show you these five plays on tape.
