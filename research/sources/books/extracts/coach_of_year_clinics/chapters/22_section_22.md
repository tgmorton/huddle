Building and Maintaining a Program 

West Grand High School, Colorado

I have come to this clinic for a long time. This clinic started in 1982 in Denver. Eddie Kintz was the first clinic director. I have made all of the clinics held here. This is a special time for me. It is a good time to talk things over and to get some new ideas. The cost of this clinic is only $60. They give you a nice travel bag when you register. That takes the cost down to $40. They give you all the beer you can drink, and now the cost is down to $20. They have 20 speakers here, so if this lecture is worth $1, we are OK. A lot of you got out of school on Friday, and that has to be worth $60. It is to me this time of the year. I am thinking about passing around a collection.

In 19761 started coaching. At that time the philosophy was "We are with you, win or tie." In 1986 the philosophy was this: "Coach, we are with you win or win." By 1996 the philosophy was this: They do not care if you win or not, as long as their son gets a full scholarship.

I would like to thank John Burke for having me on the clinic. I coached with John in the All-State game. I have worked with John on the Coaches Board of Directors. I even have ties to the person who started these clinics, Duffy Daugherty. I do not know how many of you even knew who Duffy was. I grew up in Michigan just north of Lansing. I got to caddie for Duffy in a golf tournament for three days. I can't remember what he paid me or what his score was, but I do wish I could remember some of the jokes he told. He made the caddie stay close to him so he could tell his jokes. Of course, I was a Michigan State fan, and they were good during that time. That was a real treat for me.

One person asked me if I was going to talk about our weight program. I am not. What I want to do today is to share some opinions and ideas on how to build and maintain a good solid program. We have been successful, and I will tell you what we did in our program. I say "opinion" and "ideas" because I do not have any answers. There are many ways to achieve success. There are many ways to run an offense, defense, and other phases of the game. In 21 years as a head coach, I have realized that I do not have many answers, but I do have some strong opinions.

First, I want to talk about what coaching means to me. Our philosophy is simple. You need something to hang your hat on. It is simple for me:

(1) Have West Grand High School football be a positive experience for every player. Just think about that one statement. Sometimes that is tough to do. That is our goal.

(2) Have each player be a better person for having been in the program.

(3) Treat each player as I would want my son to be treated. I try to do that with each kid. I have a son who I am fortunate enough to coach now. He is a junior. I watched him grow up being the ball boy and now a player. That has really been important to me through the years.

(4) Take the talent we have and maximize it to the fullest. We were 13-0. In 1985 we were 4-6, and that was probably the best coaching we ever did. Sometimes when you have a losing record, it does not mean you did a poor coaching job. Sometimes a winning record does not mean you did a great job with the talent you have.

Next, I want to go over the things we want to accomplish:

(1) We want to teach and lead with class and integrity. For us that is important: how we treat our opponents, our kids, officials, teachers, and everyone we come in contact with. We get letters from restaurants, old ladies, and others on how our players act and dress when they are out. That gets back to the school board, and that is important to them. If we ever go 0-10, we hope
