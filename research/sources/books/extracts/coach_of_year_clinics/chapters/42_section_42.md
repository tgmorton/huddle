offensive and defensive coordinators, I went into the meeting and told them we were going to situation-scrimmage those thing early in camp. Now, the coordinators know these things are coming the first or second day we are in camp, and they can prepare their practice schedules accordingly. It is not up for discussion. This is what we are going to do.

The next thing is the "iso-camera." This is something we use for motivation. It is a little off the wall. At Vanderbilt, the first year we played Alabama, we played absolutely awfully. When the captain of the team came to see me, I asked him why we played so awfully. Alabama may have been a better team, but we played just terribly. He told me that most of the team was scared. I couldn't believe that. I said, "Most of our guys were afraid?" He said most of the people in our program were afraid of Alabama. I didn't know what to do. We played a couple of other games, and then came Auburn. That year Auburn was as physical and as tough as any team I've ever seen. They would knock you sideways. I said to myself, ''If we were afraid of Alabama, what would we do against Auburn? This could be awful." When I was in the hotel before the game, I had an idea. We were taking a wide-angle shot, an end-zone shot, and a tight sideline shot. I got to thinking about this iso-camera. I got in front of the team and talked about being intimidated. I told them I had written out a script from 1 through 75. Every play we are out there, that camera is going to be focused on one person. If you chicken out at all, I'm going to show this video and show everybody that you are a chicken. We played like hell. We got beat 24-22 and missed a field goal on the last play of the game for the win. That gave our kids great confidence. From that time on, it became part of our program.

What we do now in practice is this. I've got a walkie-talkie on my belt. I can talk to the cameraman in the tower. I can tell him who to zoom in on. It doesn't matter whether we shot anybody or not. All they have to do is to believe the camera is on them.

We have drug testing. I don't know how you feel about it, but I think it is something we have to address. We address drug abuse a lot and test a lot. We want to help our kids to stay clean. It may remind you of police-state tactics, but I think it is the best thing for them. When they get older, they understand why we do it. I think that as educators and coaches we have to get involved in this. How you would do something like this is beyond me, but we all have to get involved.

We always study our first four opponents in the summer. It wouldn't matter to me what level I was coaching on. I would assign one assistant coach on each side of the ball to study one of your first four opponents. That would become his team. He would be responsible for putting together a book on that team. We open up the season with Texas, El Paso, at home. We've never played them before. The second game is Mississippi State at State. We play them every year. Then we play Auburn at home. We play them every year. We have a coach on each side of the ball to study those opponents. It gives one guy a lot of responsibility. He can spend a lot of time on that team so that everyone doesn't have to. If you have Mississippi State or Auburn, who we play year in and year out, they become experts on them. You will know much more about your first two or three opponents if you have studied them all summer. I think this gives you an edge at any level. You don't have that time to do it once your regular season starts.

Every coach in our program has to have a position training tape. When the defensive line coach talks to his players about a 1 or 3 technique, he has some game video cut-ups. On these videos are the things he has been talking about. They show our players using the proper techniques in a game situation. We meet with our kids for an hour. If you are on our staff, you better be a good teacher. You have to be entertaining and well prepared. I don't want them lecturing to a group for an hour. I want to see excellent tapes. I don't want to see some two-year-old videos. Position tapes are ways that coaches can study the game. I want my coaches to be students of the game.

I want our coordinators to put any gadget play in early. I tell our offensive coordinator that I want a reverse or throw-back in the first two or three days of camp. I want to do it first to the defense and second so our offense can execute it.
