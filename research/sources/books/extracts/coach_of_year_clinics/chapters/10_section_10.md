linebacker is in a 1 technique to the strong side and has the 1-gap-strong responsibility. The weak linebacker is in a 4 technique to the split end side and has the 3-gap responsibility. On the snap of the ball, if the linebacker is not running through, he takes a step back. He does that to let the linemen clear, and he can take a better angle to his gap. When we first looked at it, I didn't think we could do it. I didn't think I could coach a linebacker to back up when the ball was snapped. But it worked.

In our quarter-quarter coverage we are going to read the inside guys. If we get a vertical pattern from the inside people, we are in quarter zones deep. If we get anything else, the safeties become involved with underneath coverage. The bad thing about playing this coverage is that your linebackers end up being curl to flat players and they can get bogged down with fakes. Any coverage you put up is like a front. You are playing that coverage to gain a strength. The reason we like the quarter-quarter scheme is that we can get an eight-man front from a seven-man alignment. We can use one of our defensive backs as a hidden linebacker. We align our corners five yards deep and put the number-one receiver inside to his side. The free safety and rover are eight yards deep, keying the two man to their side.

Let me show you our support to the strong side. If the tight end blocks down or releases, the 9-technique end tightens down and swaps gaps with the strong linebacker. His responsibility is the 5 gap instead of the 7 gap. The Sam linebacker ends up outside the 9-technique end in his gap. If the tight end blocks out, we maintain our gaps. The middle and weak linebackers flow and leave the cutback to the rover.

You may not think that looks right, but it works. Our first objective is to stop the run. Unless you can whip everybody at the line of scrimmage, the best way to stop the run is to get an extra man that the offense can't block. That is why I don't like to play the quarter-quarter-half scheme. If your rover is a half player, he can't help on the run. The linebackers have to slow down, and the whole defense is in a bind. Plus one guy split out blocks two people: your corner and rover. In quarter-quarter our corners basically end up in man coverage. The underneath coverage is a route read by the free safety and rover. On the isolation weak we attack with the weak-side linebacker. He wrong-shoulders the blocker, and the rover flies up and makes the hit on the line of scrimmage. He may not keep him from gaining a yard, but he can make the hit on the line.

There are some problems you can get into when you are playing zone defense. We declare to the tight end. If an offense bring two receivers to the same side, we bring our corner over. We don't take our linebackers out of the box if we can help it. We want to match a corner on a wide out. There is very little adjustment. If the wide out motions, the corner goes with him. If he aligns over, the corner aligns over with him. It gives us cover guys on receivers. We play a lot of situation
