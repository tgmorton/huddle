candidates in my junior high program. I look at everything about them. I check their feet and their hands. I check everything except their penis. I check everything about them. I want to know what my quarterback is all about. I want a kid with hands that are big enough so he can handle and throw the football.

We start off with a couple of hand drills. I have three grad assistants here to demonstrate. First, we do the palm drill. We just take the ball and hold it out palm down. Then we do the around-the-waist drill. We just pass the ball around our waist. Next, we do the figure 8 drill.

I got a great drill from Paul Hackett. It simulates the center snap. We want the quarterback to be aware of the snap at all times. When you do these hand drills, you are strengthening your fingers and hands as you grasp the ball. The kids get down in position, bounce the ball off the ground, and grasp it like a snap. This develops the hands. We do a series of these drills every day. We do those drills every day in the weight room. I tell my quarterback and centers that they will always have three balls as long as they are at Berwick High School. They have the two God gave them, and they will have a football in their hand. When our players get through lifting weights, they are going to do those hand drills.

Next, we do a seat drill. Next, we do a one-hand snap and have the quarterback take the snap and try to curl the football. [Demo] Everything is done with the hands. I want to make the kids aware of the hands. If we are playing a game in front of 12,000 people, I do not want the ball on the ground.

In the hand drills we are trying to simulate the snap, and we are trying to strengthen the fingers and hands. We want to make him aware that they are the most critical part of his body.... I better watch what I say because we have a lady in the audience.

Next, we will discuss the area above the waist. The most important thing about passing the football is the release. I will ask those of you in the audience this question: Did anyone ever show you how to throw the football? Raise your hand if someone taught you how to throw the ball. You were lucky! I run quarterback camps. I see over 1000 quarterbacks. I am going to tell you something, men. Those quarterbacks had no idea what I was talking about. Most coaches teach their quarterbacks the X's and O's, and they teach them how to read defenses, but they never show them how to play quarterback.

I want to talk to you about five major points involved in the release of the football. We start on this when the quarterbacks are in the fourth grade. I do not want them to get screwed up when they get to the high school level. It is too late to change their release at that age. If you get them early, you can teach this.

First, we get them in a pre-throwing position. Step one: We want the ball in a trigger position. The ball is between the earlobe and the armpit. I do not want it away from his body; I want it here along and parallel to his chest. We call step one the 
triggerposition.

Step two is to release the ball at the top of his throwing circle. If we took a hula hoop and placed it in front of the player, it would form his throwing circle. We want the player to release the ball at the top of that circle. This is how you develop overhand releases. We do not want a sidearm quarterback. We want him to release it at the top of the throwing circle. You have to have a slight bend in the elbow because you cannot throw the ball with a stiff arm. We do not want a javelin thrower for a quarterback. We want to keep the elbow at a right angle or perhaps at a little less than a right angle. If you raise your arm up and bend your elbow, you will be at the top of your throwing circle.

Step three and step four go together. Step three is transferring the weight from the back foot to the front foot. It is a short step. We do not want to overstride. It is a transfer-of-the-weight step. We want you to get your hips into the step. As you transfer your weight, the ball is going on the top of the throwing circle. You are stepping and hitting that circle all together. As you transfer the weight, you follow through. You should aim your belly button at your target. I want to bring the off arm down and back. Let me have the GAs demonstrate. Give me two guys over here and two over here. Just play pitch and catch with the ball. Not bad!
