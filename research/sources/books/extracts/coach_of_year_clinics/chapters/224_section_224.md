32 BELLYFOUR WIDEOUTS

We come back and run the option game off the belly play. Our quarterback will turn out and make a quick reverse. We will run the belly until we feel that we can get the tackle on the Will linebacker. We do not have to block the 5 technique on either of these plays. All that our option game is on the back side is a sweep without the fullback. Now, we do not have to reach a 5 technique who is a better athlete than we have to block him. The ball is going to be pitched, so we do not have to block the tackle. We want to get our tailback out in the alley. We will get to the Will or Sam linebacker by formation.

If we can't get to him, we can go to three wide receivers. We can move the tight end outside and get the Sam linebacker to come outside. We can get leverage on Sam to get the ball outside if we want to run the play to the strong side.

If we want to run the play to the weak side but we can't run it weak, we will run it out of four wide. Now we have a wide receiver or our fullback with leverage on the Will linebacker.

We can also run it out of a trips set. That will guarantee that we will get leverage on the linebackers.

19 BY FORMATION

19FOUR WIDEOUTS

19ONE BACK

We do run the combo with the play. We can call 32 or 19, especially when we are going out of trips when they start kicking the defense over. We may take it out the back side. What we want to be able to do is to get our tackle on the first inside linebacker. If we can't do that, then we have to get into a formation where we can get him. We can use the wideout, we can use our fullback, or we can use the tight end to get to the inside linebacker. It will clear itself up more if I can get this videotape going.
