The Role of the Head Coach

Louisiana State University

Thank you, gentlemen. It is great to be back here. We have been traveling, and we have been gone since Sunday morning. I coached at Colorado for nine years, and it was great. We won some football games, and I thought we had a great run. Our staff at Colorado was structured a little differently from my staff at LSU. One of the differences was that not everyone on the staff at CU had a piece of the state to recruit. The recruiting at CU was something special to me. I like to travel the state and meet people. It had an impact on me. When I went to LSU, I divided the state up into nine areas. The year doesn't go by when at least one of our coaches will be in every high school in the state of Louisiana. I have been to every high school in the state. I go every spring. One spring I drove 9000 miles and never left the state. Actually I had a GA driving me, but I was in the car. My experience at CU had a lot to do with that.

I have an appreciation about what you do and how you do it. I don't think it changes much from state to state. I admire what you coaches do. I think the state university has an obligation to the high school coaches in their state. Really, it is an obligation to the high school athletes. That goes for all athletes, not just the ones we recruit.

When I left Colorado, I was the offensive coordinator. We ran what everyone called the "I-bone." I was very much involved with the offense and called the plays. When I went to Vanderbilt, it was my first head coaching experience. It was a lot like a military school. We did things the way the Air Force did. I felt the option offense was the way to go. I felt as if I was an expert with the option offense. We implemented the "I-bone" at Vandy, and I coached it. In fact, the last year I was at Vandy, which was 1994,1 coached the quarterbacks, called the plays, and was the head coach.

When I got to LSU, I didn't want to do that. I thought it would hurt us in recruiting, and it wasn't the way we could do our best. Our personnel didn't fit the option, so I got away from it. The reason I mention that is because of what I am going to talk about today. I am going to talk about what I do. It is not the X's and O's part. I am pretty far removed from that part of the game. I've gone from one extreme to the other. Two years ago I was coaching the quarterbacks and calling the plays. Now my job is much different. What I want to present to you today is how I've spent my year.

I could stand up here and be an expert on LSU's offense. I couldn't stand up here and tell you about our defense. I could tell you what we are doing. But if I had to talk on the offense or defense, I would have brought along our two coordinators. What I want to share with you is what I think I am an expert on. I want to tell you how I motivate my staff and players. I'm glad my topic in the program is Tiger football. I spoke at the Nike Clinic in Dallas, and my topic was defensive football. I never intended to speak on that subject. That was a joke. We gave up a bunch of points against Florida the week they called to get my topic. I was joking when I said defense. But, what I'm going to talk about today is what I do.

I'm going to take you through the yearly calendar. I'm going to start in July when the staff come back and start to get together in preparation for the season. I believe that as a head coach I have an obligation and responsibility to set the pace, tempo, and motivate the rest of the coaches. They all generally go on vacation in July. When they come back, I give them a book. The book has everything we are going to do between the first meeting and when our players return. That is a 10- to 14-day period. I always try to pick out some kind of theme that applies to the upcoming season.

When we took over at LSU, they had lost for six straight years. We took over in 1995 and won seven games and went to a bowl game. Everyone thought the program was turning around. This was not the coaches
