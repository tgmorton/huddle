Our first step really just gets us into position. We must stay square on blocks and stay on balance. Many times, we can't tell who is on offense and who is on defense at the line. We are both working for the same thing. Our first step will vary with alignment. Steps 2 and 3 will make or break our blocks. We have to make contact and then accelerate. I want our linemen to make contact with the shoulder and then bench-press the defender to gain separation. A couple of my guys like to make contact with the head. We don't coach this because (1) it is dangerous and (2) it gets us overextended. We don't want defenders getting into our body, and that is exactly what happens when you make helmet contact. Defensively, that is great to do. We must keep separation on offense. I want the helmet on the play side, and we teach our guys to squeeze back with the head and neck. The best rule that we have is this: When in doubt, step play-side and drive. This is the first lesson that I tried to instill in my offensive line. In talking with the Bears, I know they like to use very little apparatus like dummies or shields, and I agree to a point. I don't like for our guys to block dummies, but I will use a Rogers Lev sled fairly often. I just feel that blocking a dummy forces our linemen to put their head down and bend at the waist. I've been asked about the type of steps we take on a base reach block. It varies, because the best way to describe it is to take what you can get. Alignment will affect this, but mostly it will be affected by the type of player on the other side of the line. As far as the centers go, I want them to snap and step at the same time. This would be ideal but not always realistic. Sometimes our center snaps the ball and steps back just to keep from getting rolled. I want our centers to work on this snap-and-step action every day.

We have very few blocks to make in a game. Other than trapping for the guards (which really is not part of the zone offense), we base block, base reach, and combo. In essence, what we are trying to do is create as many initial double teams as possible. The inside hand should hit the sternum, and the outside hand should go to the shoulder near the armpit. After two years of running this offense, I will tell you this. Zone blocking is easy to learn and tough to master. It is not complicated mentally. We only make two calls on the line, covered or uncovered. The best thing our linemen can do is to help us recruit good backs like we had this year.

We had Brett Kohler from Edwardsburg and Steve Sanders from Grandville sharing time at fullback. We also used a freshman, Scott Langlois from Hopkins. All three of them can block and run like trucks. At tailback we are fortunate to have Brandon Graham from Hudsonville, who rushed for 1525 yards on 270 carries in nine games with 21 touchdowns. My math isn't great, but that is over 5.5 yards per carry. To put it in perspective for our level, Barry Sanders led the NFL with 1553 yards on 307 carries for a 5.1 average and 11 touchdowns in 16 games. Terry Allen led the NFL in touchdowns this year with 21. Our tailback rushed for 21 touchdowns in nine games. Brandon Graham is the best back I have ever coached. I know there are better backs out there at other levels, but he is the best I have ever personally been around. He ran the toss sweep successfully on everyone we played this year.

Keys To Our Zone Blocking

1. We are blocking an area. We must block the line of scrimmage first, but we have to block the second level as well.

2. We must get movement at the point of attack. Backside blocks are more of what I call position blocks, but the we must have movement frontside.
