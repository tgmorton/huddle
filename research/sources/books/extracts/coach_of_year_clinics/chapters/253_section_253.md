A lot of teams in college football try to run this play but have problems with it. The reason we have had success with the play is because we spend a lot of time on the play. Most teams are not willing to spend the time to perfect the play.

Against the split 6 or 4-4 front, if we get a defender in the 7-technique position, our tight end will block him. That allows our guard to pull around and block the frontside linebacker. Our wingback will block the second deep man. We count the outside linebacker as the first deep, so our wingback will block the corner here. Since the guard will block the linebacker, our fullback is free to block the safety.

VS. SPLIT 6 OR 4-4, GOAL LINE

We will run the flanker in motion to block the frontside linebacker. Now the fullback will go to the safety.

VS. 4-3 WITH FLANKER MOTION

Another thing we have done is run the option to a non-tight-end side if we get the right defensive look. Some teams will move the Sam linebacker out wide and play roll-up coverage with the secondary. We see this often.

OPTION TO NON-TIGHT-END SIDE

The offensive tackle will chip the rush end if the guard is uncovered. The tackle will chip the rush then block the middle linebacker. The guard pulls and either log-cuts the rush man or kicks the rush man outside. The fullback has the frontside linebacker. If the guard is covered, the tackle has to pin-block the man on our guard. The guard will still pull and block the end man.

When we get into two tight ends, we will give the play to the quarterback. He has the option to call ''either/ or'' at the line to the side where he wants to run the play. We prefer to run the play to an eagle-look side rather than the 50-front side. Sometimes the rush will be a 7 technique. The tight end will then block the 7 technique, putting our guard on the onside linebacker and allowing the fullback to go to the safety. A common blitz we see by the corner and rush is for the corner to loop underneath while the rush goes to the pitch. We teach our pulling guard to read this and go block the corner. The quarterback will option the rush, and the fullback and quarterback will bounce outside the guard's block on the corner.

EITHER/OR VS. EAGLE
