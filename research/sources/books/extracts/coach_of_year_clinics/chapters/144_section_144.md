technique. The Willie linebacker is in a 9 technique on the tight end. The Mike, or bubble, linebacker is in the 3 technique. The Buck, or stack, linebacker is in a 2 technique to the weak side.

If we are playing a team that is a pro-set, split-end-oriented team, we adjust the secondary. The secondary starts off showing a shell, or disguised defense. We give our secondary people a lot of freedom in moving around. Prior to the snap of the ball, the right safety yells, "Sky, sky, sky," and moves into a sky-support position. He does that for the front people. The backside safety is yelling, "Backer, backer, backer," and is moving into the middle of the formation. That is for the backside linebacker.

The Buck linebacker knows there is a weak zone his way. Any time we call this defense, we play the run and react to the pass. If the Buck linebacker gets any kind of flow to the split-end side, he fills the A gap inside out. If he gets a lead blocker coming in on him, he spills it outside. The right safety will be the unblocked player. He is the fill player. The Mike linebacker is a backside hip-stack player, and the Willie linebacker will fold.

If a pass shows, we play curl-hash marks with our outside people. The Buck and Mike linebackers play the inside hooks. We have a post player in the safety, and the corners are playing a loose man coverage on the wide receivers.

If a team comes out in a twins set, that is an identity in itself, and we go to an automatic cover three. We brought our corners over with the wide receivers. Whether the field or boundary corner aligns inside depends upon the receivers. We had a kid named Shawn Springs. He always gets the best receiver. That is more teaching for the corners, but it is setting up the blitz package.

If the team came out in a weak or tilted set, we go to an automatic "sky weak" call. That is the first adjustment I showed you. It is the zone weak. That is the same defense that is pictured in diagram 4.

If a team came out in a strong set, it is an automatic call. We can go to a "sky strong" call, which is like the weak call except it is to the strong side. We also have the ability to use the term "buzz." That puts the strong safety in a linebacker position. Buzz meant we were going to have support to that side of the field. To the boundary, we have linebacker support. The free safety was the post player. In buzz, the Willie linebacker is the outside dropper in pass and leverages all inside-out blocks. He turns everything back inside to the strong safety, who is unblocked. That gave us two ways to play the defense. Our strong safety against Notre Dame made 19 tackles. We held them to about 40 yards rushing, and they are a big-time rushing team.

If a team plays two tight ends and two backs and puts their flanker to the defenses left, we would make a left call.
