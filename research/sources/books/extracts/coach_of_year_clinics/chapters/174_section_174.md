SPRINT PROTECTION VS. 50

I am going to give you a couple of drills that we like. The first drill is the board drill. I was watching TV one night, and they had a special on Northwestern and the great job they did two years ago. As they were talking to Gary Barnett, they were running this drill. I decided to try it and found it to be a very good drill.

BOARD DRILLS

APosition 1 down = lineman; position 2 = linebacker; position 3 = end of board.

The man with the dummy is downfield about 10 yards. After the blocker comes off the end of the board, he goes downfield to block the deep defender.

BAngled board (3 positions); offense vs. defense; 12foot boards. I told you we do board drills every day.

I got the next drill from Dick Crum when he was coaching at North Carolina. We call this next drill the North Carolina drill. In Ohio you are not allowed to use names that would upset someone or suggest something as bad, such as hamburger drill. So we call it our North Carolina drill.

NORTH CAROLINA DRILL

(1) Snap count starts it. (2) No penalties! (3) Receiver stalks the defensive back. (4) Run to score! (5) Stay inside the dummies. (6) Three downs to score.

We start the drill with a down lineman on offense and a down lineman on defense. We have the quarterback give the ball off to the running backs. We put our receivers in the middle. We have a defensive back who the receiver is going to stalk-block. The cone gets wide as they go down the field. We put the offense on one side and the defense on the other side of the bags. We used to let the men outside of the bags hit the running back if they come outside of those dummies. We feel that this drill helps us teach our backs to get up the field. It is a 10-yard square for the total area. We make it tough for the offensive lineman to start the drill. He has to get down and drive the man out of the hole so the back can get through. It is a safe drill. We do not do it every day, but you are not going to get a lot of kids hurt on this drill.

Every day that we are in pads, we do a middle drill. We line our cones just outside where the tight end would line up. We set the other set of cones at 5 yards. Our goal is to get 5 yards per play. We go first offense versus first defense. Every day that we are in pads, we go for 5 minutes. It is a live drill for everyone. The only thing that I ask the defense is not to kill our quarterback. We run plays only inside of the tight end. After 5 minutes, we let them have a water break. Our kids like this drill.
