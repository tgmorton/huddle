# Section 203

The slicer can spiral the ball, but there is no power. I want to kick with power and forget about the spiral.

Next, I want to cover placement of the ball. A regular kick is one that is kicked straight downfield. If I want to directionally kick the ball, there are some techniques involved. Remember, we want to kick down the line. If the line is a directional kick aimed at the sideline, we still use the same principles. If he wants to kick the ball to the right, the punter moves to the left before the snap. The hips have to be turned to the right sideline. If I'm going to kick it left, I move right before the snap. Our rule is he never moves outside the foot of the center. You see some people line up over the guard. If you do that, you are asking the center for an awful lot. We don't punt outside the tackle box. We never punt outside our guard box.

To get the punters to understand height, I make them kick over light poles. I make them walk up within 10 yards of the pole and kick over them.

When they directionally kick the ball, they need a target. If they punt downfield, there is the scoreboard. When they kick for the sideline, I want them to find a target in the stands. It may be a big section number in the stadium or something like that. He can't see the pylons in the end zones. The kicker's target is in the stands.

The next type of kick is when you are backed up. Never allow the punter to be closer than six inches from the end line. That has to be practiced. The desperation kick is critical in some games. When the punter has a desperation kick, he has one step to kick it. At the end of the game with 11 people rushing is when the punter has a desperation kick. He gets one step to get it away.

The punt formation we use is the spread formation. We have two gunners on the outside to go to the ball. We have two slot backs and a personal protector for the punter.

The kicking look for mismatches is just as if you were looking for a mismatch on offense. If there is a weakness in the kicking game, find it. The punter is just as important as the quarterback. The quarterback gets the chance to throw the ball 20 to 30 times a game. The punter gets six times a game to punt the ball. You have to spend time with him. It is the single most important play in any game you play. Don't take it for granted.

Gentlemen, my time is up. Thank you for your attention.
