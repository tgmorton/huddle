I learned this years ago. I went to Alabama to watch spring practice. Bear Bryant was the coach. I stayed there three days. It didn't take long to figure out why they were national champions. We got ready to leave and went out on the field to tell Coach Bryant thanks for the hospitality. He told us before we left to go to his office and read "that deal on the wall." He said, "That is what it is all about." I did not know what he was talking about. "Yes, sir." I thought that was what you were supposed to say. We went to his office and waited for him. When he came in he showed us up on the wall a framed poem. He said, ''Read that, boy, that's the real deal. That is what it is all about." The poem was "The Man in the Arena.''

THE MAN IN THE ARENA 
It is not the critic who counts, 

Nor the man who points out 

How the strong man stumbled, 

Or where the doer of deeds 

Could have done them better. 

The credit belongs to the man 

Who is actually in the arena; 

Whose fate is marred 

By dust and sweat and blood; 

Who errs and comes short again; 

Who knows the great enthusiasms, the great 

devotions; and spends himself in a worthy cause; 

Who at best knows in the end 

The triumph of high achievement; 

And who at the worst, 

If he fails, at least fails 

While daring greatly; 

So that his place shall never be with those cold and 

timid souls 

Who know neither 

Victory nor defeat.

Thank you, men; I have enjoyed this opportunity to be here.
