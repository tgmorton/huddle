Down on the goal line, we wedge on the tackle in the gap. We come straight off the ball, and the back hits behind the double team. Against the 4-3, it is about the same blocking scheme.

On our isolation play, we were very basic. We expect our running backs to block.

43 ISOLATION VS. 50

We want to run close to the frontside guard's block. Both backs must feel the play side. The tackle must see the inside defensive lineman move. We want our tackles to take at least a 4- to 5-foot split.

Against Cleveland Ignatius and Cincinnati Elder, we faced teams that played the 4-3 defense. They both played their big tackles down tight, almost in a 1 technique. This is how we decided to block them on the isolation play. We brought the center around on the middle linebacker. Now we could isolate to the splitend side.

We scrimmage Cincinnati Moeller High School each year. I understand that they play Louisville Male High School down at Corbin. They play the 4-3 look as well. They play Princeton, and they want to prevent them from running the split-backs veer. They want to take away that inside against the veer. This is the scheme that we used against 4-3 teams.

We do not teach a downfield block. Our backside tackles never go downfield. If they can get downfield before our running backs can, then they should be playing running back. Our running backs do not cut back against the grain. They run toward the goal line. We scoop-block on the backside. We feel we have to do that against teams that slant their tackles really hard. When we want to cut them off, we do a chop block. It is a legal block. We chop them, and let them roll over the top of us. Our tight end goes downfield, but not our linemen.

Next, I want to show you our 25 and 24 veer. It is our inside veer or triple-option play. We read the first man outside of our tackles' block. We like to double-team or wedge-block at the point of attack when possible. We decided to use the crack-back block this year. We had never used it before. We came down inside and blocked the man responsible for the quarterback at times. It was a very successful play for us this year.

If we run the inside veer against the 50 defense, we read the tackle and pitch off the end. I know most of you are saying, "No one is blocking the corner if you are crack-blocking with the split end." You are right. Our running backs weigh 205 pounds; our cornerbacks are 160 pounds. We will take that match.

25 VEER VS. 50 DEFENSE

Against the goal line, we are going to wedge the tackle on the front side and scoop backside. Against the 4-3, it is very similar blocking. We still wedge on the tackle inside.

This next play was a good play for us. We got the play from Cincinnati Moeller. They ran this against us. I liked the blocking scheme against our 4-3 defense.
