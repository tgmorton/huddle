promise you that. They thought the staff was about half crazy. If I am going to ask you to hit for four quarters, you cannot wear down at the end and be successful. We have to be the best-conditioned team. If we are going to be the most physical team in our conference, then we have to be the best-conditioned team. We continue to tell our players the value of conditioning. We tell them that we will be there in the fourth quarter.

The third phase is the attitude part. We feel that toughness is somewhat of an attitude. Conditioning! You have to have the right attitude for conditioning. We talk a lot about enjoying what we do. I enjoy coaching. That is what I do best, and that is what I enjoy. At our first team meeting, I went in front of the team and asked them what they do best. No one said a word. I asked them again. Again, no one said anything. I said, "If I hit it, raise your hand. Cook? Sew? Rake leaves? Play football?" When I said "play football," some hands went up in the air. I said, "Everyone who thinks playing football is what they do best, raise your hand.'' Everyone in the room raised their hand. I assured them that they were right. "That is what you do best.'' If you cannot enjoy what you do best, then you will be a miserable person. Everyone does something well. Everyone does something better than other things. I sold them on the idea of doing what we do best. We enjoy coaching football and playing football. If you do not enjoy it, you should get out of it. We talked a lot about the attitude of it.

I feel that our overall philosophy will never change. We all know that the team with the best players usually wins. How talented do you have to be to be tough? You do not have to be the most talented to be tough. How talented do you have to be to be the best-conditioned player on the field? It does not take talent to be in shape. You do not have to run a 4.4 to be in shape. You do not have to be able to bench-press 400 pounds to be in condition. How talented do you have to be to have a good attitude? How talented do you have to be to enjoy your work? How talented do you have to be to put in a day's work? That does not have anything to do with talent. You can see why the overall philosophy is set the way it is.

We are not the most talented team in our league. Florida State is the most talented team in our league. How are we going to catch Florida State? Get better players than they get? Well, good luck. They are going to be number one, two, or three in the country every year. Their recruiting class this year was rated number one in the country. What if you can't recruit better players than Florida State? Are you just going to play for second place in the league each year? I do not believe in doing that. We have to find a way to overcome them. We have to be tougher, be in better condition, and have a better attitude than they have. Sooner or later that may give us a chance to beat Florida State. I feel that we have closed the gap some recently. The gap when we got there was a 57-0 defeat the year before. The gap is closing, but we are not there. The overall philosophy is set. Again, those philosophies will not change.

Now we get to our football philosophy. First, we want to run the football. We are totally committed to the run. We totally believe in the run. We have to sell this to our program, to our players, and we have to have them committed to this. We have to be able to run the football. It matches with toughness, conditioning, and attitude. That is what we have to do.

It is tough to stop the run in practice if you do not see it in practice. I have coached in places where we did not run the football. We have to be able to stop the run. Those are two things that we spend a tremendous amount of time with.

The third thing that is a part of our football philosophy is that we must be on the plus side on turnovers. We have broken this down in the three years that we have been at Clemson. We have lost one football game where we won the rushing game and were on the plus side on turnovers. We have lost only one game when we could win the rushing game and the turnover game. That was the game at Duke my first year, when we got a punt blocked for a touchdown that beat us. In our system this works. If we do not win the rushing game or we do not win the turnover game, then we have a hard time winning. That is our football philosophy, and that is it. That does not mean that we
