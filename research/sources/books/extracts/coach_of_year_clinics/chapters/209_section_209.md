We do not want our backs getting caught going laterally. We want a slashing-type runner. We want to get upfield. We want a 2nd and 4 call instead of a 2nd and 9 call. We do this every day with our backs. That gets the idea in their mind of the type of runner we want. They go up through the cones and then back through the cones. That does not take but a minute or two.

Next, we go to what we call the balance drill. I think it is a great drill to get the backs used to having their hands on the ground. I want our backs to understand that they are backs who finish off runs. I want them to be able to come off the ground with that hand and to be able to accelerate as they come up, so we put them in that position. You will see this in the film of our drills.

We put them down with one hand on the ground. The arm extends down from the shoulder to the ground. It is not way out in front of them. I want as much pressure on the hand as is on our foot. I want the back leg up above the butt. We want to roll our eyes up high. I put them into this position for at least 15 seconds with a ball in their hand. On the ''hut,'' they hop forward for about a yard. They keep the same hand and same foot down. They go for a series of four or five of those moves, then they come up running out of there. That is what we call the balance drill. They must have the same hand and same foot down, for example, right hand and right foot. As they hop, they switch hands and feet. When they have the same foot and same hand down, it becomes much more difficult.

We tie that in with a gauntlet drill. We have a line of players form the gauntlet. The back starts out 5 or 6 yards in front of the gauntlet, does four or five balance moves, then accelerates into the gauntlet. The players try to knock the ball out of his hand. He must put the ball in front of his breast plate, high and tight. We never go through the gauntlet with two hands on the ball. As the back comes out of the gauntlet, I will be at the end of the line. He must make a move on me and then accelerate up the field again. We do this drill every Wednesday.

We also have the wheel drill. We have four dummies in a circle. The backs step over the dummy with a ball in their hands. The back will have one hand down on the ground. As he crosses the bag, he goes all the way around the bag and then goes to the next one. As he gets to the last bag, he comes out and accelerates for 8 to 10 yards.

We use the wheel drill to change things up with the balance drill. We do the balance drill most of the time, and we do the wheel drill occasionally, but we do not miss those three drills. We do the bags, three-step cuts, and the balance drill every day. We get through them in a short period of time.

Another thing that the balance drill does is give your backs the stretch in the shoulder and hip areas to get them ready for practice. I think it is a good way to start
