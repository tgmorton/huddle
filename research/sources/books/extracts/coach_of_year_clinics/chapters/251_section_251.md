We have run the same play with the I back when we were in a one-back set. There is nothing unique about having the fullback. If we see a 4-3 front, we can run it just with the I back. We like it with the fullback. We have the blocking scheme set so that we can run it with either back.

I-BACK SETTRAP

If we are seeing a steady dose of the 4-3 with the end on the 9-technique end playing on the outside of our tight end, we will change up the blocking between the tight end and pulling guard.

The tight end will base-block the run end, and the pulling guard will block the outside linebacker. We will use this change-up against teams that like to play their rushes wide. The center is assigned the middle linebacker. He will not help the offensive tackle on his pin block.

CHANGE-UP TO OUTSIDE TRAP

If we call the play and the defense does not give us the 4-3 look, we will change back to our inside zone blocking scheme. This is nothing new for us. It is the same blocking scheme that we use to block a lot of plays. This is how we would adjust our blocking if they came up with a 50 front.

32 ROLL VS. 50 FRONT

Next is our option. Our option off the trap is one of the best options, year in and year out. Our belly option starts out very similar to the trap. The main difference is we block a 7 technique with our tight end and pull the guard around for the linebacker. We will trap to the 7 technique with our guard. When we run the option, we release our tight end inside and hope the rush end squeezes down inside. If he does, we log-cut the rush with our guard. If we get the big cut by our guard, the fullback bounces outside and blocks the play-side linebacker. We always option the force man on this play. If the rush end comes upfield, we kick the end out, and the fullback comes underneath the kickout block and looks for the onside linebacker. We tell our guard to pull flat on an even front and to climb the hole against an odd front.

Against a 4-4 front, our tackle will pin-block, and the center will protect against a slant, then go up for the backside linebacker. If the tight end has a 7 technique on him, he will block the 7 technique, and the guard will pull around for the linebacker. Since the guard is now blocking the frontside linebacker, our fullback is free to go block the safety.

OPTION VS. 7-TECHNIQUE RUSH
