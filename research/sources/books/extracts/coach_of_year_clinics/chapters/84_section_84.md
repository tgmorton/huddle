out with the flat back, toes upfield, and good balance. As the season goes on, players get lazy. A good stance will make you a better football player.

In our base stance, or red stance, we are heel to toe in stagger. We want 60 percent of our weight on our hands. I want their backs flat enough that I could eat dinner off them. However, I want the butt up a little.

If I get into the green stance, I want the stagger elongated. The hand is a little more in front. The feet are a little closer together. We are in a sprinter's stance somewhat. That lets us explode off the ball and get upfield.

The next thing is alignment. This is something we do a lot of. Basically, I have four alignments. I have what I call head, split, shade, and foot. The head is aligned head on head. The split is splitting the man right down the middle. That means inside foot splits the crotch of the offensive man. The shade is my foot on his inside foot. I am not head up, but cheating a little to the outside. The last one is foot, which puts my inside foot on his outside foot. That is as wide as we get. This is a way to adjust the players' technique. If a player comes off and tells me he is getting reached, all I have to tell him is go to a foot alignment.

The distance off the line depends on the skill of a defensive lineman. The better he is, the closer he gets to the line. Our younger players start out back off the ball. That gives them time to read and keeps them from getting reached so easily.

The third thing is assignment. We call our two inside rushers power rushers. The two ends are speed rushers. We paint on our field our rush lanes. We run stunts and twists on these lines to make sure we stay in lanes as we rush the passer. I've seen a lot of great pass rushers who don't get too many sacks, but they get upfield in their lanes. That is what we emphasize. I start off with nothing but the bull rush. The pass-rush lane is their assignment.

The noseguard is the guy who gets beat up by the center and two guards in the pass rush. This year the noseguard could make a "me-you" call to the 3-technique tackle. That exchanged gaps and lanes in the pass rush. On the "you" call, the noseguard would step into the center-guard gap and then rush outside the guard. The tackle starts outside the guard, throws, and comes back inside in the face of the quarterback.

The fourth thing is get-off. This probably is the most important thing we do. We want the player's hand moving when the ball is moving. We have to get off on the football. That is the first thing we do in practice. We try to teach them to go on the movement of the ball, not sound. If you saw the Rose Bowl, we jumped on sound about three times, and I almost got fired. We watch the football.

We do a drill to work on this. A lot of the pro teams do this. We align our defensive linemen 5 yards away from the offensive linemen. All the offensive linemen do is back-paddle. The defensive linemen sprint to them as fast as they can. They just tap them. We make a little game of it. The defense has to tap the offense before he gets 10 yards. The loser does up-downs. The whole idea is the get-off.

The strike-and-blow delivery defeats the offensive blocker. If the blocker weighs 320 pounds and the defensive player weighs 250 pounds, if you take him on square, he will beat your ass. We have to change the direction of the offensive blocker. That is where the bend in the knees and strike up through the target come into play. When we hit the sled, I do a jab-dip-rip drill. They take two steps and jab the bag. I say dip. They have to bend their knees down as far as they can go. I let them sit there for about five seconds. That gives them the feel of bending their knees. Then I say rip. They explode up through the sled.

We want to put our eyes in the V of the neck. That is our aiming point. We want shoulder pad under shoulder pad. We try to bring the hands under both armpits, bend the knees, explode up through the neck, and lock up. We have to stop him on the line.

After the blow delivery comes extension of the arms. That leads to number 6, separation from the block. The
