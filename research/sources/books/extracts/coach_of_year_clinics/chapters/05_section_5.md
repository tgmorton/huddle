The FSU Defensive Package

Florida State University

Thank you. A lot of city people have a little trouble understanding how I talk, but I can't help it. I hope all of you in here tonight are country boys. It is really good to be here. I've always enjoyed being part of a clinic. It seems strange for me to be up here talking. I feel I should be out where you are. There is so much football for me to learn. I hope I never get to the point where I think I know it all. If I do, I'll get out.

I can remember years ago when I was coaching in Alabama, every time we could get any information on a clinic, away we went. One of the things that makes coaching a great fraternity is that we are not afraid to share our ideas with each other, including the people we have to line up and play against. It is an honor for me to be here and be a part of the Nike Clinic. I know that the job Earl has done through the years has just been outstanding.

I started my college coaching career here in Kentucky. I worked for Roy Kidd at Eastern Kentucky University for a year in 1966. I coached for a year and a half in high school before Coach Bryant got me that job with Coach Kidd. I'm fortunate to have coached for that long in college. I learned a lot of football from Roy. I think he is one of the great coaches and great men of our profession. The first year I was coaching for Roy about killed me. My wife and I had just had a son. She thought I was supposed to help with rearing that little boy as she did. It didn't work that way. I was coaching offensive backs. We spent some long hours working.

I can remember the first time I went into the mountains to recruit. It was about Christmas time, and I had never been in that part of the country. There are not many mountains down in south Alabama. I was visiting a prospect. When I drove up to the house, there was a little nativity scene out in the yard. I really didn't understand everything that was there. It was a homemade deal; I guess they had made it themselves. When I got inside, I asked the boy what the three figures were outside. He told me they were the three wise men. The men were all dressed in red. I asked him why they were dressed in red. He said they were firemen. He told me that in the Bible it said, "They came from 
afar." 
I knew exactly what he was talking about, because that is the way we talk in south Alabama.

In the last 10 years I have been very fortunate to coach at Florida State. In the 90s we have been the most successful team in the country. We have lost 10 games and won 75. When something good happens, you need to find out why it did. If something bad happens, you better find out why. I think the biggest reason for our success is that we have had some great players. We have had some great recruiting years. We think we just had one this past year; only time will tell. The thing that impressed me was the way these players were willing to do the things to improve and become successful. We have had some great players come through FSU during those 10 years. We have also had some players with great ability who didn't become great players. They wouldn't get out of the comfort zone to push themselves to become great players.

We are in our off-season program now. We work at six o'clock in the morning two days a week. We have to get 10 days in before spring training. It is the 10 roughest days those guys will ever go through. It is that way by design. It is an old-time gut check for an hour. It is a time when we are trying to focus and put our guys into situations where they are going to fold or fight through it. That is the backbone, along with recruiting, that has led to our success. We work a tremendous amount on strength improvement, but at the same time we spend time working on speed and agility. We think movement is just as important as strength. We are trying to teach our kids to do things with great intensity and strict discipline. We want them to start, maintain, and finish their drills with great intensity. The thing we stress is 
never quit. 
The first thing Coach Bowden covers with the players who come to Florida State is this: "Don't ever quit."
