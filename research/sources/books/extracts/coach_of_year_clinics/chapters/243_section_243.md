I'm very proud that our linebackers are recognized by the league as being the best cover linebackers. I think the reason for that is that I coached in the secondary for a number of years. I couldn't understand why the linebacker coach couldn't get his linebackers to do the same things that our strong safety was doing. The outside linebacker is the same cover man as the strong safety. The linebackers and secondary should be doing the same drill.

A speed turn is used to save time in coverage. When the defensive back is running on the hip of a receiver, he is inside and playing on the upfield hip. The receiver will club, throw the defensive back up the field, and come underneath him. If the defensive back takes the step where he got clubbed, takes another step, then opens up and drives on the receiver, that is three steps. What we teach is to take one step, make a quick head turn, and then come right back on the receiver. We teach our linebacker to do that, and we practice it.

When I came back to the linebackers after coaching the defensive back, I started teaching these big-bodied guys those techniques. They thought I was crazy. They looked like cows falling out of the back of a pickup truck. They were horrible looking. Now they rival the defensive backs in their technique.

We do a catching drill of some type. How many times does the linebacker get his hands on the football and not finish the catch? Most of the time, the guys in the secondary are receivers who got kicked off the offense. They couldn't catch the damn thing in the first place. The linebackers need the work even more than the defensive backs. Most of those linebackers wished they were tight ends catching touchdown passes. They got moved to defense because they couldn't catch a cold running buck-naked in a rainstorm. Because of that, we have to work on their hands every day.

We will pass-rush every day. Those are the drills we do every day. Our individual period every day starts out being 20 minutes. You are bullcrapping yourself if you think we ever get 20 minutes. The first drill that the head coach cuts so that you have time to add whatever he is putting in is the individual period and special-team period. To get all your individual period in, you have to do your drills in combination. Don't do single, one-specific-coaching-area drills. Do two or three specific areas in one drill. Jeff Fisher tells me I have 20 minutes in individual period today, but eight minutes later when he blows the horn to go to the next period, I've got my individual drills all done. I'm still going to do those things that I told you we do every day in eight minutes.

When we get finished, there is a lot of hard breathing going on. We go 100 miles an hour. Let's say we are going over bags today to work on agility. We work on our step-overs and -ups and changes of direction. We work on their eyes while they are going over the dummies. Get in a position where you can see their eyes. If you stand behind them and watch their butts, you are stupid. You have to coach through their eyes to know what they are seeing.

They go down the bags stepping over them. Then they go up and down them changing directions. They get on the back side of the bags, and they work on protecting the near arm. They play same arm and same leg protecting against the cut. When they get to the end of the bags, there is a guy there who jumps at them like a frog and tries to cut them. The linebacker plays his hand on the head and turns it. Where the head goes, the body follows. After that, there is a cross-the-bow tackle. I work on agility and cut-block mechanics, get a live rep on the cut block, and make a cross-the-bow tackle. But he still doesn't get an "attaboy" unless he strips the ball on the tackle.

On the tape, you will see us working on the low part of a seven-man sled. We work on upper-body strike. If I work on upper-body strike, I have to concentrate on the hand positioning also. The man who works his hands inside will win the battle. The thumbs have to be up. We have the big muscle groups of the upper body involved. If the thumbs get inside and the wrist rolls back, the wrists get jammed. The plexus of nerves across the tops of the arms shuts off, and you have no upper-body strength. We extend on the dummy with our hands and violently shed it as we go to the next dummy. At the end of the sled, I'll give the guy coming
