The backside 5 technique is controlled by the naked bootleg. With every run we have at Florida State, we have a naked bootleg. The split end releases hard inside for the free safety. If he can't get him, he turns back on the off corner. We have a three-step read for our flanker, or what we call the Z receiver. He is reading the corner and free safety. If the free safety comes, he cracks on him. If the free safety stays back and the corner hangs, he blocks the corner. If the corner comes in a hard corner or cloud coverage, he blocks the corner.

The tight guard pulls up the alley. The fullback's initial takeoff point is the inside leg of the tackle. That is strictly a takeoff point. He starts toward the inside leg of the tackle until the guard clears. From there, he tracks the onside linebacker. The fullback probably will find the linebacker in the 7-technique area. If the linebacker has a blitz on, the fullback finds him and chops his outside hip. If you can get the linebacker on the ground, it is easier for the tailback to get to the next level. When you block them high, they have a better chance to come off and make the play.

The tailback takes a lateral flow step or hitch step so that the fullback can clear. The quarterback takes the snap, seats the ball in his belly, reverse-pivots, and pitches the ball to the tailback. The tailback concentrates on catching the ball. The secret here is not to get in a hurry. He wants to let the blocks develop. The guard and tailback key the tight end's block. In this case, the guard goes outside the tight end who is coming down on the 7 technique.

The tailback takes a flow step and heads downhill. We want him coming toward the line, not laterally. The tailback sees the down block on the 7 technique and bounces the play outside. The play now depends on the blocks of the guard and fullback.

Let me draw this up against a leverage front, or 50 front. A lot of people don't think this is a good play against this kind of defense. We played Texas A&M in the 1991 Cotton Bowl. They ran this type of defense. They had the noseguard in a 1 gap, a defensive tackle in a 5 technique, and a defensive end in a 9 technique. To the back side, they were in a 1, 2, or 3 on the guard. They played hard corners with the safeties free. We had a tailback who became the MVP in that game. He gained almost 180 yards rushing. We ran the sweep 15 or 16 times on a cold, rainy, sleety afternoon in Dallas, Texas. The defense has leverage in the 5 and 9 techniques. The tight end and tackle have their work cut out for them. They have to block players who already have them outflanked. They take a small zone step and cross over with their next step to the crotch of their assignment. They have to knock them back. They entangle their blocks and knock them back at whatever angle they are.

The tackle and tight end take the outside arm and punch through to the outside number of the defender. They grab the inside number of the defender and turn him. They have to accelerate their feet. We talk about two things in blocking. We talk about the initial lick or contact and accelerating the feet on contact. We get physical with our feet. The man who accelerates his feet on contact wins the battle.

The tight guard pulls and reads the tight end. He is still on the strong safety but reads the tight end. If he doesn't see the numbers on the tight end's jersey, he goes around him. If he can see the numbers of his jersey, he pulls inside the tight end to get the strong safety.

The center has to scoop hard to block the shade gap player. We have had good centers at Florida State, but we have had average centers who could handle a 1 and 2 technique. It is hard, but still they can do it. Unless you are playing against a totally dominating football player, that block is not as hard as it seems. If the noseguard moved all the way to a 3 technique, the tight guard would give a "stay call." That means he stays in and blocks the 3 technique. The tailback will have to make a move on the strong safety. We block the line of scrimmage first. We want to block the inebackers second and the safeties third. You can't
