We take two defenders, who can be other players, quarterbacks, or managers, to rush the quarterback. The quarterback takes his drop and checks the rush. We rush at the angle that the defensive ends will be rushing in the game. The quarterback must step up in the pocket and make the throw.

Next is our pressure drill. Do not let anyone do this but the coach. As soon as the quarterback releases the ball, the coach throws a hand dummy at the quarterback. Do not hit the quarterback anywhere near his throwing hand. Again, do not let anyone throw the dummy except the coach.

PRESSURE DRILL

I like to use this drill on individual routes. I have a hand shield, and I throw it at the quarterback as soon as he releases the football. I do not sling the dummy, I throw it at the quarterback. Again, we do not want to hit the quarterback on his throwing arm. We want to simulate the type of pressure they will see in the game.

The last drill we use in our throwing drills is our clock drill. The coach will point to the wide receiver. The wide receiver flashes his hands. The quarterback must work from his right to his left and from his left to his right. The quarterback must step and turn on each target. You can have as many receivers as you want. We want the quarterback to move his feet and shoulders together.

CLOCK DRILL

If I flash my hands to the number one receiver, the quarterback must throw the ball as soon as possible. If I flash the number two receiver, the quarterback can look at number one and then come off to number two receiver. You can build this in with the different pass routes you are running. We mix it up on the patterns.

We feel it is very important to take the first 15 minutes in practice and work on these drills. It is very important for us to do them, especially this year. What we like to do is to get out to the practice field and warm up, then do our flexes, and then get into our drills. After we get through with the drills, we go to individual routes.

Next we go to our quarterback throwing techniques. These are the things we work on.

Lower bodyStep toward the target, and shift the weight. We want a flex in the left knee. We want the quarterback to allow the hips to come through. We want to take a short stride. We want to follow through toward the target. That is the number one thing that we stress. When the quarterback throws the football, he wants the hips and everything else to follow through straight forward.

Upper bodyWe want to set the ball high. We want to get it up in the air. We want the quarterback to turn the ball away. We like to say that we take the football off the shelf. This is what we teach in our camp in the summer. The elbow must be at 90 degrees. The elbow must be higher than the shoulder. The lead arm must assist with rotation of the shoulders. We want to snap the throw-off.

I am not a big grip person. We want the quarterback to snap off the throw with his finger rotation. If the quarterback is throwing with a normal rotation, I will leave him alone. If the ball is wobbly, we work on the rotation with that quarterback. We want the quarterback to use as little motion as possible in throwing the ball. We want to get the ball out of the hand of the quarterback.

The next area is the passing sequence. This is after the drop. First, we want to stand tall and be balanced.
