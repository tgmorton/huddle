do well on a test. We want it to be the same way on the field. You can have fun in practice if you can see that you are getting better. You can coach them on the run and push them to get better. We want to make sure that the players are doing things right. Look for a perfect practice. Are we ever going to get a perfect practice? Probably not, but we are going to push and strive for it. We are not going to accept anything less than the best effort. When the season is over, I do not want a player to come up to me and say, "Coach, we could have been better." Would'a, could'a, should'a. When it is all said and done, we want the kids to know that we did everything that we possibly could have done.

This is something we do at the start of the year. I call all the coaches up around me. I have all of the players out in front. I ask the players to hold up their hands if they want to be coached by a coach that gives them a half-ass effort. "Raise your hand." No one raises their hands, naturally. Then I say this: "Men, our coaches do not want to coach players that only give them a half-ass effort!" Everyone must be in the same boat. Everyone must believe in what we are doing. This may be a little thing, but the light goes on with some of the kids. They know they must put their heart and soul into what we are doing.

Confidence comes from consistency. Goal line must take a top priority. There is no reason to get down there if we can't score. We must study ourselves and go over and over our goal-line package. It is important that you study yourself. I will cover this again later. Everyone must be doing the best he is capable of doing and nothing less. We never walk on the field, coaches and players alike. Coaches must coach on the go!

Goal-Line Offense: Theories And Principles

Here are some theories and principles that we believe in. This is more important than giving you our X's and O's. If we have time, I will show you some of the things we do on the goal line. What I am going to cover with you now are ideas that you can develop and use in your offense, regardless of the offense you use on the goal line.

You attack the defense in two ways: (1) in an 
area 
where the defense is somewhat weaker and (2) a particular 
individual 
whose style of play can be exploited. We concentrate more on the first point, which is to attack an area. When I first started coaching, we would attack the individual first. But what I found out was this. We would pick out an individual who we felt we could exploit, and we worked on plays against that individual. However, that player's coach could see what was happening to that player, and by the time they played us, they had pulled that player out of the lineup. We wasted time working against a player who did not even play against us. Now, that does not mean that we are not going to look at attacking an individual, but first we are going to look at an area to exploit the defense.

We want to present a well-balanced offensive attack inside the 10-yard line. What does balanced mean? It does not necessarily mean 50-50. I can't tell you what well balanced means for you. You must decide what the balance is for your team. We like the balance to be about 60-40 in favor of the run. If we look at our offense and find that we are running the ball 80 percent of the time, we will make an effort to include more passing in our attack to get back to being balanced in our attack.

We want to force the defense to balance up to our offensive formations. We can go from three wide receivers to two tight ends with the same personnel. Do you change your personnel on the goal line, or do you use the same personnel? We run the split-back veer-option offense. We do not have to change personnel. The same offense we are running on the 40-and 50-yard line is the same offense we will be running down on the goal line. I get confused when I see teams that run the I formation in the middle of the field and then get down on the goal line and go to the wishbone formation. To me, that is an entirely different offense that you have to spend time on in practice.

We like to run option football inside the 10-yard line. We continue to attack on a broad front. Coach Lou Holtz use to say this: "Don't flinch." If option football got you down to the 10-yard line, don't be afraid to call
