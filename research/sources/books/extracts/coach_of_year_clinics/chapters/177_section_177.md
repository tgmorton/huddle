As coaches, our perception is that these things are good for you. We are establishing discipline, learning how to give effort, and learning how to finish plays. But to the players, it is a pain in the butt, and it is hard. Therefore, they have no goals or direction. How could they like it, do well at it, and be committed to it? They have no reason to be committed to it, because we didn't sell it to them correctly.

Highly motivated people give consistency in performance. Motivation comes from knowing what you want accomplished and being committed to it. Even if you know what you want to accomplish, what does it take to do it? Your attitude is made up of your habitual thoughts, habits, and priorities on a day-today basis. You can have good or bad thoughts, habits, or priorities, but you control those things. We can change those. If they are bad, we can make them good. That is where it all starts.

Sometimes young people need direction. It all starts with your attitude. The sum of all those habits, thoughts, and priorities is your character. That tells what kind of person you really are. That takes into account the decision you make when the coach is not watching. It takes a lot of character and self-discipline to be committed to something that you want to accomplish. It takes a lot to see it through to the finish.

The first thing is to work and invest your time in something that is important to you. That is critical to being successful in anything. Don James used to say, "You reap what you sow." He was my college coach. He talked about two farmers. One guy worked from sunup to sundown. The other guy sat on his porch all day. When harvest came, the guy who worked hard had the biggest harvest you could possibly have. The guy who sat on his porch had nothing. The price you pay for success must be paid in advance. There is no way you can be successful and not pay the price up front and in advance. It never just happens. You have to make a tremendous investment in it. Invest your time in something. Don't spend it.

The second thing is that you have to stick with it. You have to be persistent and learn from your mistakes. It is so difficult to coach guys right now. They are so self-centered and selfish. So are my kids. It is the way young people are today. It doesn't make any difference how old they are. They have too many choices. They never have to make any commitments to anything. If they are not making any baskets today, they go over and hit golf balls. If the range is a little hot, they go swim in the pool at the country club. If the water is too cold, they go play baseball. They swing three times and miss, so they go do something else. That's what my kids do.

When I grew up in West Virginia in a coal-mining town, we had a company store, and that was it. We had a ball diamond. The company owned it all. When you got up to bat, there was nothing else to do. You kept swinging until you hit it. Most of us hit it pretty good because we didn't have a choice. We made a commitment to doing it because there was nothing else to do. It is not that way now.

As coaches, we always tell our players what they did wrong, but we seldom ever tell them what they did right. I think you have to find ways to reinforce positive performance in the way you coach. You need to be more positive with the players. They always respond better that way.

They have to learn that there is a seed for every good thing in every mistake they make. There is a learning experience in those mistakes. Old Buck Nystrom used to beat our guys with a stick. But they responded to it, and he was one of the better coaches I've ever been around. They used to say to him, "Coach me, coach." That is what he tried to convince them of. They wanted to learn, so he got to them. They took it and respected him. That is what you need to have.

They have to be positive about the negative mistakes they have. They have to see that they are learning from that and growing. In doing that, they learn how to overcome adversity as well.

Our team right now, to me, is right at the choke phase. We are right where we can choke when it counts. That is not negative. I think you have to be damn good to choke. You can't be in a 29-29 game in the fourth quarter with Penn State and not be very good. You
