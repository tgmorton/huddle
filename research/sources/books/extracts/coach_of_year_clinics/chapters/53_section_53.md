he does. The point I am making is this: Everything he does the kids are really sold on. If you expect your team to be good, you are going to do better.

Now we are going to the five-step principle. Now, this situation for the inside receivers is similar to what we had for the outside receivers. Earlier I talked to you about man-zone read. What this boils down to is this: We have a good idea of the type of coverage you will be in, based on the pre-snap estimate. But again, we are not sure. Normally, we call this route when we know the defense is getting ready to get after us hard. We have a man-zone read with the split end.

The first thing we do is to come up and check the wide receiver to the split-end side. We have a hitch route for him. If we get cover three, we run the weak-side hitch. We are thinking inside on the play. The reason we have the hitch set up is in case they have any kind of zone coverage. If the defense is playing man coverage, we have what we want inside with the second route.

The inside receiver runs what we call a shallow route. It is a shallow crossing route. Generally speaking, we should have a weaker cover man on us on this side. It could be the weak safety or the weak-side linebacker. He may not be as good as a player on the outside.

It is built into our system that we can change the split end and the wideout to that side. If we want to put another receiver into the game and put our best receiver in the split-end side, we can. We can interchange those two men.

DOUBLE RIGHTSLIDE LEFT 168 SHALLOW/WIDE

What is the split end looking for? A man-zone read. If he has a man on him, he gets the man in his hip pocket and continues across the field. He tries to outrun the man underneath him.

The tight end runs a deeper six route than he did on 166. He goes deeper because the quarterback takes a five-step drop. We would not run this play out of the shotgun, because we are going to hit the split end on the crossing route quickly. Some shotgun plays are better in the red zone than others.

The tight end comes down the field and reads the defense. If it is zone, he sits down inside. If it is man, he keeps coming deep. If we get the zone coverage, we end up with a high-low between the two ends. If it is man, we look to the weakest cover man, and most of the time it would be on the split end. If we feel that we have a good shot, we may go over the top and throw to the wide receiver on the post. If the free safety starts jumping the crossing route or they are doubling a receiver, we take a shot at the post route over the top. That would be based on the game plan and situations.

We can take the formation and reverse the patterns. We can make the tight-end side the weak side of your formation and have them run the same routes as the other side did. They reverse patterns. The tight end would run the crossing route. The split end runs the six route. The pro back runs the hitch, and the wideout on the split-end side runs the post route. The quarterback reads the set. If the hitch is available, we take it. If the defense is up tight, we run the 60-shallow combinations.

This has been a good route for us, particularly on third down. It was good on 3rd and 5 or 3rd and 6. You need to work on those situations in practice. As I was saying earlier, you know what won for you, and you know what lost for you. We do a lot of team passing drills because we are going against good people every week. We go one against one every day except Thursday. Now, they can't tackle the quarterback. It makes the line work hard on protection, and it give your defensive front work against good people. Another thing, it
