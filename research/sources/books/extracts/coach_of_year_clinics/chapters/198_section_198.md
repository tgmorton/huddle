I collect quotes. I have about 500 or so, and I'm going to give you a few of them. "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail." We all talk about this. It is spring, and it's time to get ready for spring practice. The quote I keep on my desk is, "I'm third." We all know who is first. One thing that I tell our coaches is that if our players don't come above a lot of things in their personal life, I won't have them around. If you are going to be a coach, the most important thing you have to understand is that ''players winyou don't." If you want to have a job and be a successful coach, you better make sure that you end up doing what you have to do to develop those players. You need to have a good relationship with them, because they do come first in a lot of things. "Life is in sessionare you present?'' We all go through life. The older we get, sometimes we don't feel that.

"Happy are those who dream dreams and are willing to pay the price to make them come true." We all have dreams. At our clinic this year in Florida, I probably had more former players who are now coaches than any other coach there. I draw these three circles on the board all the time. One is for wishing, the other is wanting, and the third is doing. It is important to make your players understand that everybody is wishing and wanting, but very few people are doing. I take it a step further and draw a little circle inside the "doing" circle. That means the people inside the circle are doing it 24 hours a day.

We all have to do things with our football team to help them understand. I want you to write this down. I want you to write down "14 days." I want you to circle that. Years ago in the 1960s, there was a boom of people going around giving motivational talks. They would get two to three thousand people going to a clinic. These people would come out of those clinics and were going to beat the world. They would go to an insurance seminar. They would come out of that meeting ready to go sell a million dollars of insurance. It got really expensive, and a lot of people began running those clinics. There is one guy on the west coast who is good, but he charges $20,000 for a 30-minute talk.

I'm going to give you about a $20,000 talk in about 15 seconds. You won't remember what you hear here for an average of 14 days if it is not a part of you. If it is not part of your philosophy or understanding, you won't remember what was said here. It is the same way with your players. It doesn't make any difference what you tell your players as long as it's part of them.

I want to play a coach who jumps on a table, screams, and hollers before a game. He tries to get his players so fired up that they want to tear the locker-room door off. The emotion lasts until the first play. When the guy across from him slaps the crap out of him, he doesn't care what the coach said in the locker room. What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter what any of us say. Unless you are willing to take it in and digest it to where it becomes a part of you, whatever we say is going to last about 14 days.

In the third circle on "doing," I would put names and leave it on the board. Every few days, I would put a name in there of someone who was actually doing it. He was doing whatever you asked him to do. Then I would take the circle, tighten it down, and put some more players in there. You are not going to have but a few players on your football team who do it 24 hours a day.

"We are not often what we think we are, but we think we are." When you think about things and talk to players about them, make sure your players are on the same wave length that you are.

I like this one very much. It fits all of us. "Take out your brain and jump on it. It gets all caked up." We think that we are really intelligent. Age make you wiser sometimes, but sometimes it makes you dumber. When I was a young coach, I spent a lot of time going to clinics. I took my summers as a young coach to go visit schools. I went to Texas A&M, Texas, Houston, and Oklahoma all in one summer. The reason I did that was because the wishbone was the popular offense in the country. Being a defensive coach, I wanted to understand the wishbone from the offensive side, so I could stop it.

"When the little bird tells you something, make sure it is not a cuckoo." Don't start or believe rumors. I have a rule. I do not respond to the third party. I am probably
