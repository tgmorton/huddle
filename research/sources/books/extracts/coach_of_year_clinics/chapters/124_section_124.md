route is covered, the quarterback resets and throws to the choice receiver. It is a quick 1, 2, 3. It is just like the clock drill we just did.

This is what the routes look like against what we call cover-two float. The Mike linebacker cannot cover the tight end if he is going deep enough. If the safety gets uptight, we send the wideout deep inside behind him.

R-L VS. COVER-TWO FLOAT

What happens if we see cover three? If we get cover three we can work on either side. We work against both sides. We like to work the backside post. We want the wide receiver to break inside at 8 yards and catch the football on the hash mark.

ROWLEE VS. COVER THREE

Let me show you the same route from different sets. These are what we call our Row and Lee sets.

ROWLEE VS. TWO FLOAT

If we call 
move, 
we can set the tailback to the splitend side, bring him back in motion, and run the same play. It is simply 830 flat choice.

ROBLIZMOVE VS. TWO FLOAT

We went with a one-back set and ran the same plays.

DOUBLESONE-BACK SET

Everything we teach on routes develops off this route. This is where we start out teaching. In the no-backs set, notice where the B receiver is lined up. We ran the 839 flat choice route.

839 FLAT CHOICEEMPTY

This gives the defense a different look, but it is the same route. We want to give the quarterback as much of an edge as we can. That is our two-man game. There are a lot of ways you can do it.
