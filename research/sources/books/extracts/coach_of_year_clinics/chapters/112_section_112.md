C. Athletic abilityI want athletic ability more than size. If I can have both, of course, that is what we want. Height is not a major concern to be able to adjust on the move.

D. AggressivenessNot a passive mentality. We want the defensive mentality on offense.

What I Want From My Coaches

I think too many times we look at only the players for improvement, when, in fact, improvement from your coaching staff could help you a great deal.

A. Coaches must be a good teachers. This is easy for us, because all of our coaches still teach, just like most of the high school coaches here.

B. They must be demanding. We must tell our players exactly what we want from them and then make sure that it gets done.

C. I want our kids to trust us. You hear a lot of coaches give this lip service, but it really is important. This takes time. I had recruited a good number of our offensive players, but when I switched from defense to the offensive side of the ball two years ago, I had to earn the trust of the offensive players.

D. The fourth thing I want from my coaches is to remember that most individuals still learn far better from positive reinforcement than they do from criticism. I should pay closer attention to this myself. Too often, we are too critical of our players. I started off our preseason meetings a year ago by telling my coaches that unless they had a way to recruit players into the program during the season, they had better complain less about them and concentrate on making the ones we had better.

E. The last thing is to be up front with our players with criticism and praise. If he does something well, make sure you tell him. If he does something poorly, make sure he knows about it. Most of all, we must remember to be positive.

We take a lot of pride in what our team has done and especially in our offensive line. I want my offensive line to be tough, play as a unit, and be as athletic as I can find. We have to have a system, whether it be the zone concept that we are using, or the wing T that many of you use. I coached defense for nine years at Hope. Seven of those years were spent as the defensive line coach. The problem with being an assistant on the opposite side of the ball from the head coach is that you always get players dumped on you from the other side that they don't want. A kid might be third or fourth string, and those other coaches would always try to convince me that he could really help us. It is nice to be the head coach and be able to refuse those switches now.

Why The Zone Blocking Concept?

We switched to the zone offense two years ago after running the wing T for seven years. When I became the head coach, I knew what I wanted to be known for. I wanted our offense to be balanced, and I wanted to have a dominant running game. We have done that. We are now known for our zone running game. Our zone blocking helped our tailback to average 170 yards per game this year. I wanted a blocking conceptnot a schemethat we could use on a variety of running plays. It just seemed to me that with most other offenses, so much time was being spent on scheming and diagramming plays on a weekly basis. I wanted to spend more time on teaching fundamentals and techniques, and this offense allows me to do that.

We didn't rush into the change either. This is the offense that I became familiar with 12 years ago at Illinois. We listened to Tom Osborne and Pete Schmidt talk about this offense in Dallas two years ago, and I met with Bob Nielsen from Wartburg College. We had seen it run effectively at all levels and became more and more convinced that this was what we wanted to do. All of these coaches cautioned us to keep it simple and stick with the base plays, especially in the beginning. I should have listened more closely. We installed too much in 1995. In 1996, we scaled the number of plays back considerably. We decided to do exactly what everyone had cautioned us to do: Keep it simple, and do a few things well.

Now we run three plays from the inside zone: the dive off the option look, the play we call "inside" (the play
