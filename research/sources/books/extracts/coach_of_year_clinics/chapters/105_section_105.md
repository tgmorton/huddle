gap. The ends know that if we call load, the call-side end is responsible for the C gap. He is a C-gap player.

Our linebackers are responsible for two gaps. They have a primary gap and a secondary gap. In our load, the Mike linebacker is an A-gap player. The Sam linebacker is a D-gap player, and the Will linebacker is a B-gap player. We are a four-spoke secondary. We have two safeties and two corners. We will always give you that look. If we go to our over 53, the look will stay the same for our secondary. What we are doing is nothing hard. We try to keep everything simple. Those are the two fronts we ran against pro action. If the offense came out in two backs, one tight end, and two receivers, we call that look 
regular personnel 
When we see that set, that is what you are going to get from our defensive front. If you come out in what we call H formation, which is two tight ends with one back and two wide receivers, we get into more of a base look.

When we call load G, this tells the backside tackle he is going to move from a shade to a 2 technique. Our backside end is in a 5 technique. This is good against the bootleg reverse. I will cover that later.

On the isolation play, the offside tackle is going to get a drive block. The first block that the end has to learn to defeat is the drive block. He has to step up and knock the tackle upfield. He keeps his outside leg and arm free and forces the ball inside.

5 TECHNIQUE VS. DRIVE BLOCK

The fullback is going to lead on the Will linebacker. He steps up and takes on the fullback with his inside arm and leg. He forces the ball back inside for the Mike linebacker. The Mike linebacker is playing two gaps. He is responsible for the strong-side A gap, and he is also responsible for the backside B gap on flow away. I want to talk about two drills that I do that help the ends take care of the men in front of them. [Demo] The first drill I will talk about is our explosion drill. We have to be able to attack that man in front of us. He needs to know what to do if that offensive tackle knocks him off the ball. He has to be able to step back and strike again.

We start off in a two-point stance with a slight bend in our ankles, knees, and hips. The head is up. As the man steps toward me, all I want to do is explode and put my face mask inside with my head up and get my hands inside on the breast plate. If you have a two-man sled, you can use it to work on the drill. If you do not have a sled, take a player and have him hold a hand dummy. Teach him to explode into the dummy. Teach him to strike a blow in a good football position. We call this pads-out drill.

We want to teach them to come up with the ankles, knees, and hips and explode into the man and push him off of me. We want to teach him to play with pads up. He has to learn to step up and hit the blocker and knock him back off the ball. All you need is three or four reps a day working on pads-out. It is best to start the drill with a stationary machine. He does not need to move his feet. You are looking for explosion and the power move.

We teach the drill a little differently than most people. Most people start from a three-point stance. We start out teaching this technique from a two-point stance. Once he learns to hit the sled and to explode and get his knees and hips into the drill, we teach him to step up and strike from a three-point stance. We call this our pads-out drill.

We have a defensive checklist. There are a lot of things to teach the defensive ends. We do not make this list very difficult. This is very simple. It is a good thing for me to review. Each day I go over certain drills. I do not do everything on the checklist. We do some of these drills every day. We talk about these drills from the two-, three-, four-, and six-point stance.

Next, I want to talk about the skate drill. In this drill we do basically three things. I will demonstrate these
