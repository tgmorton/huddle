Thank you very much. It's good to be with you today. It is an exciting time of year for me. It is an exciting time of year for anyone in the coaching profession. I used to come to these clinics all the time. In my opinion probably the best coach who has ever coached the game of football was Paul "Bear" Bryant. Coach Bryant used to get up and tell coaches, "If you can live without it, don't coach." I have thought of that over the years. My son played college football for me, and I used to tell him that I didn't want him to go into coaching. I wanted him to get another job. Looking back, I think that was a mistake. I wish he had got into coaching.

I love coaching. I tell people all the time that if I ever get out of coaching, I'll have to get a job. It is a great way to make a living. When I get up in the morning, I can't wait to get to the office. I hope most of you feel that same way. Right now we are looking at tapes of last year's games. We are looking at the good and bad things we did last year. We get in a workout every day. I'm a strong believer in being in coaching condition. It keeps you young. It gives you a chance to work out with your players. We work out in the weight room with our players. When they see us in there, they want to get in there and work out too. It is a fun job, and we all make good money. We are making more money than we ever dreamed we would be making. You get a chance to work with these young players. I don't know what the hell I'd be doing if I were not coaching. It is a great profession. And to think you have any influence over these young guys is a very gratifying feeling.

Every time I go visit somewhere, I ask the question, "What is the best thing about your program?" At Ohio State obviously we have good players. We have some great football players at Ohio State. But the best thing about our program is the chemistry and the work effort of our players. The best thing we do at Ohio State is our off-season program. You win in the winter conditioning program. Our players love to come in and work out. I think we have the best strength coach in the country. A lot of our former players who are playing pro ball work out with us. If you come up to our place at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, you will see Eddie George, Terry Glenn, Ricky Dudley, Joey Galloway, Orlando Pace, and a lot of others in there working out. Our players love to have those pro players around there working out.

Our football players spend 12 months a year in Columbus, Ohio. I tell them they don't have to be there in the summer, but if they're not, they are not going to play. They are all there during the summertime. That is why we have a good football team. They are there, and they work their butts off.

We have a saying at our place: "What you see is what you coach." When you look at films of your games, what you see is a reflection of you. There are a lot of things you can control. You may not be able to control the ability of your players, but you can coach them to line up properly. You can coach them to get in a good stance and not make mistakes and things of that nature. Teams that jump offside and get all kinds of penalties are a reflection of how you coach them during the week. When you run a defensive drill, you should move on the ball. Move on the ball, don't go on a cadence. Everything we do in the winter conditioning program with our defense is movement on the ball. Little things like that you can control.

I believe that your players will play as well as you expect them to play. If you talk about next year being a rebuilding year or "we're not very fast," then you are setting your team up. You will not be very good. At our place we lose more underclassmen than anybody. We have lost about 10 underclassmen to the pros. This year Shawn Springs and Orlando Pace are leaving early. I don't worry about guys I don't have. Don't worry about things you don't have control over. When one leaves
