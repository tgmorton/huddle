There are three things that can happen to defensive linemen. They are going to use a base block, reach block, or cutoff block against him. If the defensive linemen can defeat the block, fight pressure, and get across pressure, that will take you to the ball, where you can make plays. The first thing that young lineman wants to do is to rise up to find the ball. He wants to make a play. The first thing he knows, the offensive lineman is blocking his butt off. The example is two boxers in the ring. If we are equal, and I'm not watching the other boxer, who is going to win the fight? The defensive lineman is going to get killed if his focus is on the quarterback or running back. The offensive lineman's focus is on the defender. I have to get them to focus on the blocker.

If the guy across from you leaves, there is someone else coming to block you. He will get a down, fold, or trap block. Once the guy across from you leaves, the next guy coming is the guy the defender has to defeat. If it is a trap, he has to wrong-arm it and spill. If it is a down block, he has to get upfield or across the face. If he can beat the blocker, he can make plays.

Should a defender attack upfield or sit on the line of scrimmage and read? When I went to Bowling Green, we were strictly read defenders. We were in a parallel stance and were not going to get reached. When I went to Washington, I got more into getting upfield. Now we want to be able to do both. I'm convinced we have to do both. We have to be able to get up the field and come backdoor on all down blocks. We also have to be able to come cross-face on the line of scrimmage.

If I am a tackle over a guard who pulls, what do I do when the down block comes? In our game plan, we are going to have two ways of playing it. We are either going up the field and coming backdoor, or we are going across the face. If the offensive tackle knows the defensive tackle is attacking upfield, he takes a flat step to the line every time to get the defense walled off. But on the other hand, if the defensive tackle is always sitting on the line of scrimmage, the offensive tackle gets more depth on his charge.

What we teach is two calls. We have a red-and-green call. The green call is go. We are going upfield as hard as we can. If we get the down block, we are going backdoor. We grab cloth, swim, and come down the line of scrimmage behind the blocker.

If we have a red call, we sit on the line of scrimmage. If we get the down block, we strike and fight across face to get inside-out on the ball. Against Arizona State in the Rose Bowl, we always played red unless we were in a nickel defense. The reason for that was their counter play. They ran that play better than anyone I've seen. We wanted to stay on the line of scrimmage. Our 3 techniques made more plays than anyone because they thought he was coming upfield.

At Ohio State we basically have three fronts. We play the Bear front and the reduction to both sides. We call them slide, tight, and Ohio defense. Off each one of those defenses we have a front-line movement. That lets us change a gap for any defensive lineman. We have games to stunt the interior four defensive linemen. We also have blitzes off each one of those. This gives us a multiple look.

I know you guys don't want to listen to my philosophy. So I'll cover it quickly. It is not too different from most people's. But I do think this is important. I spend as much time with the players with this as I do with technique. One of the things we did this year was blitz a lot. Every time we blitzed, we twisted. I've never done that as much as we did this year. Our philosophy was to twist two down guys and tie up three guys trying to block them. Let me give you an example.

Let's take the noseguard and the 3-technique tackle. If we were coming with a Mike or Buck linebacker blitz, we twisted these two guys. We felt that if it took the two guards and the center to block the nose and 3 technique, no one was coming free. The only problem was the defensive linemen were not getting any sacks. That goes back to our first philosophical thought: The team comes first. We may not make the sacks, but the team does.
