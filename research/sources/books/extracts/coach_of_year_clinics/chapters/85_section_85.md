defensive lineman has to lock out his arm. It has gotten so bad with the holding calls. The referee calls holding once a game, and that is it. In our league we are getting held every play. When we run scout teams in practice, I tell them to hold our defense.

The seventh vital technique is disengagement. That is throwing the linemen away to get off the block. We work really hard on throwing the man. If you try to move before you disengage, the blocker will be right on you. We run a simple drill to practice this. I have a blocker in front of me. The defensive man has his hand under the armpits and locked out. All I do is step one way or the other. The defensive man throws the offense off the other way. It's a simple drill.

The eighth thing is pursuit. This year we did a cut-up of every play that gained 10 yards or more against our defense. There were 27 plays in 11 games where the opponent gained 10 yards or more. Out of that 27, 6 were reverses, 5 of them were against our second team or others. That brings it down to maybe 17 plays in 11 games for 10 yards or more. I think that is pretty good. Our guys run to the football. We talk about relentless pursuit. We run a lot of pursuit drills. We constantly harp on it. The hardest thing I have to do is to get men on the line to run after a pass. To do this, the two most important things are attitude and effort.

The ninth thing is tackling. I'm not going to talk a lot about that. The one thing I will say is about fine-tune drills. We want to tackle a guy high from behind. That prevents a quarterback from throwing the ball, or it may cause a fumble. I do a drill at least once a week on this technique. Maybe it will happen in a game because I worked on it.

Another drill that is a fine-tuning drill is called the "bend drill." How many times have you seen a defensive end get a great pass rush, beat the blocker, but end up running by the quarterback because his momentum carried him wide? That is centrifugal force. We run a drill and time our ends on running around a cone and bending end. They have to dip their shoulder, touch grass, and run all the way around. We do it from both directions. That may be the skill that strips the ball from the quarterback.

One tackling drill I do every day is work on a quarterback breaking the pocket. I put a manager back behind a pass-rush drill. I use the quickest man I can find. We run our pass-rush drill, using our techniques to get free. Once we break free, the manager scrambles outside. I want them adjusting their paths and making an effort to get him. I don't want them to break free, break down, and sneak up on him. I want them coming hard. I call this the "brain drill" because as that defensive man is breaking free, I want him thinking that the quarterback is going to run somewhere. I don't want him to just rush upfield like a big lug. He has to think after he beats the block to get the quarterback.

These fine-tune drills are realistic. They are things that players are going to see in the games. I want them to have worked on them so they can handle them in the game.

The last thing is react to schemes. Every team that you play is going to be good at two or three schemes. We are going to identity the three or four things they do best. We are going to work like crazy on them that week in practice. Those are the 10 vital techniques we have to get across to our kids. When you put that all together, you have yourself a football player.

The most important part of the game to me right now is pass rush. You have to get pressure on the quarterback with your front four. I work four areas of pass rush. I work the get-off. That is the green stance. Next is the setup. This is the one I've tried to work on over the years. The next area is the move. You can use the rip, over, or bull rush. The last thing is the countermove. That is how I break down the pass rush.

Let me talk briefly about the setup. What we are trying to do is get you off balance. Every offensive coach in the country tries to keep his offensive linemen in a balanced frame all the time. When they are in that stance, they are good. It is hard to get around him when
