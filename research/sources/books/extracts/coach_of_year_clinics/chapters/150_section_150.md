story. It illustrates the role of the scout team and its players much better than I could explain it. Ever since that night, our scout team has been called the "Rudy team."

The movie is about a scout-team player at Notre Dame. I will try to explain a few points in the movie. This kid on the Notre Dame team was a scout-team player, and he got to dress for the final game of his senior year. In the movie, as the Notre Dame players went out of the locker room to the stadium, they would reach up and touch a sign that hung in the hall leading to the stadium: "Play like a champion today." I think it had the logo of a leprechaun on it. Every player who passed by the sign would reach up and touch it with one hand on the way to the field.

We are the Buffalo High School Bisons. We have a decal on our helmet with a buffalo on it. The day after we got back from camp that year, I noticed one of our decals over the door that leads out of our dressing room to our football field. Now when our kids go out to the field, they reach up with two hands and touch the buffalo on the way out, just as the Notre Dame players did in the movie. Of course, our players are a little smarter. They realized that two hands would be better than one.

Now, all of that may sound silly. But wait until you see our scrimmage vest. [Yellow scrimmage vest with "Rudy" painted on it displayed.]

While the scout team is a tough job, we do not candy-coat it or blow smoke. We try to tell it like it is. We want to have fun, but we want to stay focused. This is what we want to accomplish. (1) Show outstanding effort and attitude in duplicating opponents' plays. (2) Your job is to make the first team better. (3) The better you make them, the more playing time you get. (4) Our secret goal is to score on the first team.

We try to sell our kids on being Rudys. I do not know whether we sold it to them or they bought into it or a little of both, but being Rudy is a big part of our team. Believe it or not, when Coach Moon says that it is time to scrimmageand those of you who have not seen the film 
Rudy 
will not understand thiswe have four or five chants of "Rudy, Rudy, Rudy." They start chanting from four or five places on the field. In the movie, that is what happened. On the last play of the year, the scout-team player named Rudy got into a Notre Dame game.

We do not sugar-coat the scout team. We tell them what our goal is. We want an outstanding effort and attitude in duplicating the opponent's plays. Notice, we added 
attitude 
in there. On Tuesday we get in the huddle, and the first thing I tell them is this: "Your job is to make the first team better. That is your job. That is what you are here for." On Wednesday we tell them again, "The better you make the first team, the more playing time you are going to get." I tell them this in the huddle. Again, our secret goal is to score on the first team.

This Rudy deal has been going on for three years. Our kids know that being a Rudy is being part of the team. That goes with the territory. We tried something new this year that worked out really well. When our freshman team completed its season, we still had three or four varsity games left. This year, the freshman coach picked five players from his team to be Rudys for the rest of the season for the varsity. Freshmen cannot play varsity at our school. However, they can play on scout teams. This is voluntary, because it extends the freshman season. So far no one has refused it; in fact, they consider it an honor.

As the scout team coach, I try to be as positive as I can. In fact, it gets a little sickening at times. But when my 5' 9", 120-pound tackle comes back to the huddle looking through the ear hole of his helmet, it is not going to do me any good to chew him out. My big job is to convince him that we are having fun. Sometimes that gets tough to do.

Generally speaking, Buffalo High School gives no individual awards. We do not have a "Most Valuable Player" award or anything like that. However, two years ago, we changed that. I am sure that all of us have had teams where we had seniors who have been on the team for four years and have never missed a practice and, more than likely, have never been late for practice. When the Rudys huddle up, they are usually
