going to the coffee shop to get a cup of coffee. We worked on defense until he came back. Sometimes we worked on defense for two hours. He didn't know who our defensive players were or what we were running. That was great. When you get rid of the head coach, you do all the things you would do if you were the head coach.

The last year that I was in college, Bum Phillips came up with his numbers defense. He was coaching for Bear Bryant at Texas A&M. We ran the numbers defense at Ballinger. The even techniques are head-up positions. The odd techniques are shoulder techniques. From the center out both ways are the numbers. Head up the center was a 0 technique. Head up the guard was 2, the tackle 4, and the tight end 6. The inside shoulder of the guard was 1, and the outside shoulder was 3 technique. The outside shoulder of the tackle was 5. The inside shoulder of the tight end was a 9 technique. The inside shoulder of the tight end was a 7 technique.

The first thing we did was to know how to line up. We could change those defenses as quick as you could shake a stick. We could call 37 on one side and a 59 on the other. That was a good defense. We had an eagle on one side and a 50 defense on the other. We were good and had one heck of a football team. When Carlos left, I thought I would go back and run that Ballinger defense. I had three assistant coaches tell me I couldn't do that. This was in the 1990s, and I was talking about running a defense we had run in the 60s. We did that. I think it is still pretty good.

At our level you have to stop the run. You can do that with an eight-man front defense. If you can't stop the run, just tell old Grandma you're going to be there for Christmas. You are not going to any bowl games if you can't stop the run. I'm not very smart, but through arithmetic I know that if you've got seven guys up there, they can't do as well as eight. We are going to have eight guys up toward the line, and sometimes we are going to cheat and have nine. We are going to play the safety as the middle linebacker. That was part of what we set out to do. Also, we said we were going to keep it simple.

I learned a great lesson four or five years ago. Bobby Ross went to San Diego as head coach. He hired Bill Arnsparger as his defensive coordinator. Well, Bill is 150 years old. He hadn't coached football in 25 years. He went in there and told them they were going to line up correctly. The year before, the San Diego Chargers lined up by alignment wrong over 50 percent of the time before the ball was snapped. Their defense was the worst in the NFL. When they went to camp, they didn't work on technique. They worked on getting lined up correctly. I believe that the next year they ended up number 4 in the NFL, and the following year they were number 1 on defense. That was all due to lining up correctly.

I didn't think lining up was so hard. It is hard if you are not careful. We said that we were going to start over. We had a notebook burning. We had a notebook that weighed 80 pounds. We had a couple guys on our staff who were "notebook nuts." I said, "Get rid of the notebook." I told them, if they wanted to change jobs, to do it. We are going to change this defense. If you want to be part of it, that was fine. If you don't, then leave. We are going to be simple. We told our players if you don't like it, don't bitch. Just take off. We were going to find somebody who does want to play. Just leave, and good luck to you.

We started off with four simple objectives. They were simple. (1) Stop the run. (2) Be simple. (3) Create some turnovers. This next one I really think is important in football. I think the difference between winning and losing is momentum. (4) Have the ability to change the momentum of a game. If you are not careful and do not have a way to change the momentum of a game, you are in trouble. Sometimes you don't have any control over that. We are willing to roll the dice and change the momentum of the game.

We stress turnovers. We have a drill which takes us nine minutes to run. It has five stations in it, and we
