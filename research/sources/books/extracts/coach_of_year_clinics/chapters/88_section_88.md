into the A gap weak. Mike and Buck linebackers fastflowed to the strong side, and the free safety played the weak-side B gap for the cutback. That was our 1st and 10 defense.

The Bear defense is probably our best defense. We played this a ton in the bowl game. As far as making things happen, this is our best defense. We have a good front five who got off on the ball. We twist our inside people and blitz like crazy from this. We played manfree in the secondary. The other thing we did off this was to show the Bear, drop out, and play zone. We slanted back to the strong side, and the defense ended up being the tight front. The Will linebacker would drop, and we played zone out of it. In the bowl game we played this with our nickel defense.

Gentlemen, thank you for your attention.
