and not out on the shoulder pad. You have to turn back in to the man.

If you have more than one man to deal with, we just cover up with both hands on the football, get our pads lower than their pads, try to split the area, and try to get YAC. In our backs' minds, this is what they are thinking, and we get enough reps on it. If they can beat a defender with a one-on-one move, they do it. If they are dealing with only one man, they use the lift. If they are against more than one man, they do the blast. To teach the blast drill, sometimes we use the blaster. We will put two men with hand dummies in front of the blaster. If he can split the two dummies, then he will come on through the blaster. If he can't split the first two men with the dummies, he does a spin and heads back up the field. It is a great drill for backs to get their pads down and to develop good running angles. After we teach the drill, we run it at a high tempo.

We teach four blocks in our system. We have what we call an attack block, an attack-and-adjust, a pass pro block, and a cut block. It does not matter what they are doing on the field, but they should be using one of those four blocks when they are called on to block. This is true even when they are blocking out of the punting game. We are still an old-fashioned punting team. We still have two tight ends, two up backs, a fullback, and a punter. Our up backs set in the hole between the center and guards. If anyone comes in that gap, he attack-blocks him before he goes down to cover.

If you are on the kickoff return team and you are the fullback, you come up and block using what we call an attack-and-adjust block. If you are on a special team, one of those four blocks will come into play.

An attack block is when the ball carrier is directly behind us and the back is going to break off our block. They are used on power and iso plays. We want to execute the block by running in a natural motion. We do not want the arms swinging hard. We do not want the feet to be in a wide base. We want the feet up underneath us. Again, we want to make sure that our pad level is under the defender's pad level as we do the striking. We do not snap the hips up on the striking. All that does is to raise you up and bring your pad level up. We never snap the hips forward on the contact.

It is one thing to block a defender who is standing still and another thing to block a linebacker who is moving. We start out working on our pass pro block. We have each man take three blocks, and then on the fourth block I will critique each individual. It is a quick drill. We go to the attack block after that. Each player gets four blocks each.

I talked to you about the attack block. The attack-and-adjust works this way. As the blocker approaches the defender, the defender shuffles a couple of quick steps. Now the blocker must adjust his body by shuffling. He get his hips squared up with the defender and then attack-blocks him. The key is to get the feet underneath them and get back in front of the defender. After he adjusts his path, it becomes an attack block.

I will take you through the different running and blocking drills on the tape. [Video]

On the blocking phase of the film, there was some good blocking. You are not going to knock people down all of the time, and you are not going to win all of the battles. They have to understand that they do not win every battle on the football field. If they are trained right in terms of your drills and techniques, you have a chance to win most of your games. The key is to have your backs go into the game with a tremendous amount of confidence. If you are a running back in our system, you are really involved in play after play. I want them confident about their technique and confident about their ability in terms of going into the contact phase of the game.

I want to thank the high school coaches because you do a great job. We have to depend on your films a lot. We have 38 states that we cover, and we do not see everyone. But where there is a player, we try to see him. We appreciate the high school coaches for their cooperation. If there is anything we can do for you, let us hear from you. You are welcome to come to visit us. Thank you very much. I appreciate being here.
