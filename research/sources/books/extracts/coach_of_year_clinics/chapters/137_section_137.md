knack for scoring and put him in the tailback position. Then we want to get him some space to work in.

A lot of this thinking started a long time ago. When John McKay was at USC with O. J. Simpson at tailback, they would pull the linemen and run the student-body right sweep. Basically, what they were doing was to get their best back on the corner and have him stretch the play outside. He may stretch the play all the way to the sideline and go out of bounds. They would run the play over and over. Then suddenly he cut back and ran the ball into the end zone.

If you looked at the wishbone teams that Barry Switzer had at Oklahoma and Darrell Royal had at Texas in the 1960s, their object was to get the ball to one particular spot on the field with the pitch. They would arc-block with the lead back and be able to kick the ball out to the deep back. They knew they could score with the great backs that they had if they could get the back around the corner.

If the defense stretched outside, the fullback up the middle would score on you. Of course, they all had a quarterback who the defense had to take away. They were trying to get the football into the hands of the players who could score. They wanted to put them into space where they did not have to go over a pile in order to gain yardage or score. The people who were innovative on offense were doing that. They were trying to get the football to players who could score.

At West Texas State and at UTEP, we had done it like this. We had a nice little package that Grant Teaff and Bill Young had made popular at Baylor University. In those days, most people ran a 50 look. We ran the isolation with the wingback coming back in motion. We would run it and run it. After we set it up, we would reverse body-block, and the onside guard would pull and cut up on the free safety who was running in the alley.

A lot of people had the ideas of getting guys into space who could score touchdowns. The objective of offensive football is to score. We took the same idea and put it in at Copperas Cove. We decided that we would do all we could to put the ball in the hands of the people who could score and see what they could do. The formation we got into was this. We split both ends and had a wide slot to one side. We went from a split backfield set. Everyone liked to play cover three or cover one in those days. They wanted to leave seven in the box to stop the run. The teams we were playing were not gearing up to play us. They were getting ready to play the good teams. Those teams ran the ball out of two backs and two tight ends. We made them pay for not being ready to defend us. We would usually try to get the split end deep. We would look for a player who could catch the ball over his shoulders and the one who had the best speed on the team.

Mike Majors and I would sit in my little office and write all of the players' names down on a dry-marker board. I would get to make two picks for offense. I got to pick the quarterback and the split end. After that, Mike got 17 picks for defense. That is how we split our players up. I knew for us to have a chance to win, we had to be able to play defense. All of the good players who were average high school players ended up on defense. On offense we ended up with one fast man at the split end or X position. We did end up with a trigger man under center.

Let me show you how we lined up. We had an ex-tuba player at center. At the left guard, we had a player who was big. His name was Chester Jordan. When we got there, he was a ninth grader. He was 6' 4" and weighed 340 pounds. He could run the 40-yard dash in a day. He could bench-press the bar. When you take over a new job, you have some guys left from the previous staff. We would always ask them to tell us
