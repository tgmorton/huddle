and outside gap. If we are in the 50 defense, both guards would make an uncovered call. If the tackle kicks down and covers the backside guard, he makes a covered call. If the nose man is in the 1 gap, the guard to that side makes an inside-gap call. If the tackle on the back side is in the 3 technique, the guard to that side makes an outside-gap call. If the defense has 11 men on the line of scrimmage, hopefully the quarterback can see it, and we will do something different.

When the scout team is on defense, we try to give them as many combinations as we can on this. Both of our offensive guards make the calls on every play; it does not matter what the play is. The left guard may make a covered call, and the right guard may make an uncovered call. This identifies our blocking schemes on the line of scrimmage. Also, it indicates to the back the blocking scheme and where he should run. This helps us communicate with the players when we talk to them during the game. We want to duplicate as many looks as we can for our guards in practice. This includes the blitzes and stunts you might run. We huddle and call the defense. We try to duplicate everything as much as possible. We give the guards as many combinations as we possibly can. I am convinced that there are three things that a team needs to be successful. (1) You need good players. The more good players, the better. (2) All players need to be schooled in sound techniques and fundamentals that complement your offensive and defensive schemes. (3) You need team chemistry.

I believe that team chemistry exists when the players care about one another. In 1995, when we were state runners-up, we felt we had a better team talent-wise than we did in 1996, when we won the state championship. Our 1996 team drew a line in the sand and said, ''This is it. You are not going to pass our line." They did not let you past that line. I have spent a lot of time trying to figure this out. I have talked to Coach McCall about this a great deal. I think team chemistry is when the team truly cares about one another. Now, if that is a correct definition of team chemistry, what does a coach do to cause that to happen? I am not sure about that point, but I have thought about it a long time. I think that we as coaches must care about our kids if we want our kids to care about each other.

My time is up. I thank you for your attention. I hope your scout team has lots of Rudys.
