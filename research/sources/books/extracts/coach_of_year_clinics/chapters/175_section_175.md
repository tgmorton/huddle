MIDDLE DRILL

I felt that we had a very good defense this past year. I judged our practices this year on how well we did against our defense. Our defense was outstanding. We have 12 starters coming back next year. We only had one senior running back. We have eight starters coming back on defense. When we meet next summer, our goals will be to win the Greater Miami Conference, get into the state play-offs, and win the Division I state championship of Ohio. Our goals will not change. We will be very competitive. I have some of the state finals against St. Ignatius that I want to show. If you have any questions, I will be around. Thank you very much.
