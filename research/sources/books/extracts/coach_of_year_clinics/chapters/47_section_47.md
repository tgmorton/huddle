trying to outguess your opponent, it can get in your way a lot of the time.

I know this: "Coaching will not win for you, but it will get you beat." That is a profound statement. What I am saying is this. If we are playing against Tom Osborne or Jimmy Johnson or whoever, we better be ready to play. I will assure you that their team will be ready. We are not going to outcoach them. Their players will be just as well prepared as our players. But if you do not do everything they do, then that will get you beat.

Some coaches think they can come up with magic on Friday night at 7:30 that is going to make them win. I do not believe that is going to happen too often. Basically, you will have to make a few adjustments along the way. The teams that are constantly changing and trying to get a sense of direction and do not have a feel for what they are doing have players who do not have a lot of confidence about what is going on. If you change what you are doing every Monday, it becomes hard to believe in. Have a system and believe in it and make it work.

I have been involved with some good quarterbacks, and I have been involved with staff members who helped make them good quarterbacks. I really believe that one of the real key issues, beside the fact that they had good arm strength, is their decision-making ability. It is not just having the ability to do the right thing, but making sure they do not do the wrong thing. A lot of times, players with pressure on them cannot react properly. A lot of times in high school, the best athlete in the school is the quarterback. You need a player who the players have a lot of confidence in.

I do want to cover a couple of other things about handling your quarterback. I think it is critical that you coach all of them, regardless of age. The reason I say that is because one of these days that freshman is going to be a senior. You have to find time to coach that player as much as you do the other players. That is hard to do, I will promise you. Too many times coaches get involved with play polishing, and they are only involved with one group. I would rather have four groups alternating and coach them on the run than have three of the teams just standing and watching everyone else. When they do not know what to do, it is hard to get much accomplished. I think it is important to coach them all and to meet with them all. Have them in your meetings. Learn what it takes to make them tick.

You cannot find out what a player can do by talking to him on Friday night if you do not talk to him all week. We have a rule that if we are in a staff meeting and a player comes over to see a coach, we are going to leave the meeting and talk with him. It does not matter. I know what I can do. You had better make sure the quarterback can accomplish what you want. Over the years, the thing that has been successful for us has been the fact that we have given a lot of meeting time and practice time during the individual period to everyone. Now, you get into the team situation, and it is different. You are not going to be able to work three and four groups. But it is important for players to understand your system and to come along. You would be surprised at how some of these men can play when they are given the chance. My philosophy is to coach them all. Give them all a chance to learn what is going on with the individuals.

What we are going to talk about today is "attacking the red zone." We are referring to the area from the 20-yard line to the goal line going in. When you get the ball inside the 20-yard line by running the ball, it is hard to get away from what you are doing, and they start throwing it. The same is true if you pass the ball down to the 20-yard line and then start running the ball. Our basic philosophy is this. Whatever got us down there is probably what we are going to continue with. If we are playing a team that has been knocking the crap out of us and then we get down to the 20-yard line, we are not going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out which running plays will go. We know that all of a sudden we are not going to become Ben-Hur. Do you know what I am saying? By the same token, if we get down there by throwing the ball, we are not going to change just to be changing.

Regardless of the system you use, there are a few obvious things you need to consider inside the 20-yard ine. The other team is going to start taking more chances. They have not stopped you in 80 yards; what
