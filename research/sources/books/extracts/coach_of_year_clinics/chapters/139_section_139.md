If we did not think we could beat him deep, the quarterback would throw the ball behind the receiver. The quarterback would throw the ball a little flatter and over the receiver's shoulder. He did not want to throw the ball over the top of the defender. What we did was to force the defense to cover the split end tightly with the corner and safety. Most defenses wanted to play eight-man fronts. They wanted to play that safety man in the middle. When we got them to move the safety over on the split-end side, we had to be able to attack the slot side. Now they had the same problems on the slot side with the Z end. We were teaching him the same things.

After a few years, teams started working on the uncovered aspects of our offense. Then we started pulling linemen outside to block for the receivers. That got us to our quick-screen game. Every time we came to the line of scrimmage, the defense had to cover the X end, or the quarterback was going to get him the ball. If the defense covered him with two men, we would go to the Z receiver. If you did cover him with two defenders, we would go to Z. Soon we had two receivers covered by four defenders. If you start looking at your running game, you have to feel that is a good deal.

The coaches before we got there ran the I formation. They tried to run the ball between the tackles. The defense played them with an eight-man front. They could not block them because they were outnumbered. We wanted to get the advantage back on our side. If you will look at the thing, you can see what I am talking about. If the defense is covering the X and Z receivers with two men, then we are going to look at the Y man in the slot. If the defense did not put someone close to Y, we did the same thing with him. You could occupy the corner, and Y would have to work on the strong safety.

You can take a player who is not a tight end and play him at the Y. You can take a basketball player and play him there. You can do all kind of things with him. You can put him in motion and do a lot of other things. He can control the man on the running game. By using our philosophy to throw short and all of that, we have controlled five of the defenders.

It does not really matter how you line them up inside on defense. You have a chance to run the ball. You have a hat for their hat. If your players will get after them, you can run the football. We play little games with the defense over and over again. The thing that will happen is that you will get to guessing with them. You do not know when the defense is going to blitz or drop seven or what they will do. What we did was to take it out of the coach's hands and put it in the quarterback's hands. If the defense is guessing with me, he is in bad shape, because the quarterback is calling the plays. If the quarterback is calling the plays, he can see what is happening. As the game goes on, he knows what the defense is doing. Now the quarterback becomes a part of your offensive philosophy. He becomes a part of the rhythm of the game, so to speak. The quarterback can check plays a lot better than the coach. We were teaching the quarterback what we wanted. We wanted to give the quarterback enough freedom to call the plays at the line. We had to give him a system that was simple enough that he can change the plays with one word most of the time.
