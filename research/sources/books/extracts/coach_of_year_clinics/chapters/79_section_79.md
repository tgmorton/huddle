plants, and then works on a 45-degree angle back toward the ball. Most of the time, the linebacker drops out of that area. We drop the ball in the area where the linebacker was at the snap of the ball.

ANGLE PASS

We do not want the quarterback to stand and hold that football forever if the back is covered. It is hard to pass-protect, so we know we have to get rid of the ball. If we get man to man, we still have had luck with the angle. The reason is because we run so many arrow routes outside. Our tight end breaks down the middle. If it is a two-deep, the tight end goes deep. Against a three-deep, he will sit down in front of the safety. Most of the time we have passed the ball to the back against zone defenses. We did get a touchdown throwing the ball to our Z back out of this play.

This next play was taken from the Denver Broncos. I do not know whether they have run it recently. We call it fire boot pass. It takes advantage of the quarterback coming outside. It has been a good play for us. It is a bootleg-type play. We block down flush on the strong side and pull the off guard. The secondary gets a run read on the strong side from the tight end. We run a 12-yard out route on that side. The tailback runs an inside route and makes a fake inside. He picks up anything coming through. The quarterback turns and looks at the back. There is not much of a fake. We just front out, sprint five steps, and set up behind the tackle. It is a pre-snap read. If it is a three-deep secondary, we run the out route to the Z back at 12 yards.

FIRE BOOT PASS

If we get a cover five or a two-deep, the quarterback knows he will not go to the Z back. He will take his five-step drop and look for the X end on the sit route inside. The quarterback knows from where the free safety lines up what he is going to do with the ball before it is even snapped.

Now, we have another phase of the play. We called this play "continental" when I was growing up. Now, we run the same play, but this time we bring the left halfback out of the backfield on the swing route behind the X end. He comes out and up, getting depth as he widens. That play has been so good to us over the years. We used this pass in the playoffs against Clarion State in Pennsylvania. We did not score on it because our quarterback wanted to make sure we completed the play, so he did not lead the receiver far enough, but we scored on the very next play. It is blocked just like the bootleg.

FIRE BOOT CONTINENTAL PASS

We do run some two-tight end plays. This is our four vertical route. We call the play F delay. Our back steps up in the protection, but he will continue through the ine and sit down over the center. If we are getting a
