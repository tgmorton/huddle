linebacker in the 4-3, weak-side inside linebacker in the odd front, and weak linebacker in the stack.

The tight end's pattern is 10 to 12 yards deep. If the middle linebacker goes weak, the quarterback goes immediately to the tight end. If the middle linebacker goes to the strong side, the quarterback immediately goes to the weak side and keys the weak-side linebacker. If he hangs on the curl, the quarterback hits the back. If the linebacker jumps the back, he hits the curl of the split end.

Men, it has been a real pleasure to be here. I'll stick around for a bit if any of you would like to come up and ask any questions. Good luck to you. Thanks very much.
