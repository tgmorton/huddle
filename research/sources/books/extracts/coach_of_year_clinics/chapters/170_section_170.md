stance to block. We do not do that. We do pass the football, and we sprint out. We do combo protection. However, we do not teach a backup blocking technique, per se. We do not use blocking sleds very often. We have all of the great sleds, but we seldom use them. We probably should sell them all, because we do not use them very much.

Now I am going to tell you some of the things we do that we feel helped us for the entire year. We take a composite schedule of all our opponents. In Ohio you must qualify to get into the play-offs. We put our opponents' schedule down. Each week, we keep track of what they did for their games. If they win, we put a W in that column. In the 13 years we have been at Lima, we have been to the play-offs four times in the last eight years. This is something we start looking at very early. It is a goal for our kids to get into the play-offs. If you want to see what we do, I will be glad to mail you a copy.

When I get with the assistant coaches in the summer, we lay out a master practice schedule for them. Our coaches know each day what we are going to be putting into our system. They can look ahead and prepare for the practice. We plan our offense, defense, and kicking game this way.

Every day that we go onto the practice field, we have a practice plan. Again, this is for some of the young coaches. Our coaches know what everyone is doing at all times. We do not waste a lot of time. We do not have a lot of time, so we want to be organized. We have our practice planner on a computer, and we can print it out very fast after we get it set.

Another thing our assistant coaches like a lot is this duty chart. I put it all down in writing. If you are on my staff and you are responsible for videos and you are to trade the tapes with the opponents, you know that you are to do that. Our coaches like this because they know exactly what they are responsible for.

Another chart that we like is our rating of individuals. We send this rating chart to our freshman coaches to rate their players. They may send it down to the middle schools for them to rate their players.
