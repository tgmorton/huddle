the most-publicized guy in college football over the last 10 years. I'll give you a good example. When I was at Texas A&M, we had this guy who was worth $800 million. He was the chairman of the board. The newspaper kept going to him because he took credit for hiring me. He didn't hire me; I came for some other reason. But he took the credit, and the newspapers would talk to him. Every time he would say something, they would come to me for a comment. I would tell them that I would not respond to that question. They would ask me in 20 different ways, trying to get me to respond. I finally told the newspaper guy to go get the chairman, bring him into this room, and I'll respond to your question. You will find that will never happen.

"You cannot leave footprints in the sands of time by sitting on the beach." You need to write this one down because it is really true: "The road to success is always under construction." Here is another one that really applies to athletics: "It is better to fail at something than to succeed in doing nothing." This is probably my favorite one: "If you must cry over spilt milk, condense it.'' We all have problems. It is our responsibility to convince the players that their problems are not as big as they think they are.

The thing that I'm concerned about in high school these days is the resurgence of pot smoking. I've studied in the Arizona drug-testing committee. They put drug testing in college programs. I was the first coach in college football to test all our players. I believe in it, and I've saved a lot of players' lives from crossing over that line. Research tells us that it is being grown inside under lights and is two to three times more powerful. If you don't or can't test your players, you need to be constantly aware of what is going on. Players cannot play and perform if they are doing those things.

I am here for you, so stop me at any time if you want to ask a question. When we talk about motivation and how to motivate people, that is a misused term. The more mature players you have, the better football team you are going to have. I've been around probably the best college team ever as far as talent. Every player from our starting 22 played pro football. On the 1980 team that I had in Pittsburgh, we had 27 players; 3 were drafted in the first round, 11 in the first seven rounds, 18 others got drafted, and 22 went to camp. We went through a span of four years where we went 11-1. If it hadn't been for the dumb-butt coaches, we probably would have won the national championship at least two times. Coaching is just like the Kentucky Derby. All the horses in the Kentucky Derby have a chance to win, or they wouldn't be there. All those horses can run.

What is motivation? The best example I can give you is playing for Coach Bryant. There was no coach in college coaching like Coach Bryant. He forgot more about winning than we will ever know. We were playing Tennessee. It was fourth down, and we had the ball on their 4-yard line. Coach Bryant had me by one arm and David Ray, our kicker, by the other arm. He sent us on the field. Suddenly from the press box someone yelled, "Clock play." Stabler came up to the line on fourth down and threw the ball out of bounds. He stopped the clock, but we lost the ball on downs. The game ended in a tie.

We went back to our locker room after the game. The manager had left the keys to the padlock on the door out on the field. Coach Bryant knocked the lock off the door, and we all filed into the locker room. About that time, all the coaches started coming in. Coach Bryant told all the coaches to get out of the "damn locker room!" Here we were in the locker room with Coach Bryant. He told us that in all his years of coaching, this was the first time he, as the coach, had lost a football game. He always talked to the press. That day he left the locker room, talked to no one, got in the police car, and left. He usually had a meeting with his coaches on Sunday morning to find out who played well. That meeting didn't happen.

On Monday morning, all the coaches were sitting around the big conference table in his office. They were all early because that is the way Coach Bryant wanted it. He looked at his watch and said that he was five minutes early, but he wanted to get started anyway. We were playing LSU the next week, and they had a great football team. He told all his coaches if we didn't beat LSU to pack their bags. He didn't talk to any of them for a whole week and never had another staff meeting. We went to play LSU and won 35-6.
