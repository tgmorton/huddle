the bags, but we do use the bags. We start out on our knees and work from that position, so we can go from a upright stance. We teach the punch, rip, swim, and underhook techniques. If we use a live man, we can get more out of the drill after we have the techniques down.

Neil Hopkins, Our Defensive Coordinator, Will Go Over Alignments and Stunts. Coach Neil Hopkins

It is a great honor to speak at one of the best coaching clinics in the United States. I have attended this clinic for the last several years and have always come away with something that helped me become a better coach. It has helped us become a better football team. We feel that if we do not attend clinics, we are hurting ourselves and our team.

We have been very successful at East Bank High School because we have good athletes and they believe in us and what we are trying to do. Hopefully, I will be able to give you one new idea that each of you can use in your program.

We use a multiple defensive scheme to try to balance out against the many offensive sets we see. We try to cause as much confusion to the offense as we can. As you know, you must defend the whole field as well as you can. You must try to balance your defense to take away as many weaknesses as you can.

We had always been a 50 defensive team until 1993. We went to a 40 scheme but still liked the 50 because it has always been very good to us. When we started looking at other schemes, we tried to come up with a sound system that would allow us to play both defenses, without a lot of confusion or personnel changes. We depend on our Will backer to be able to play down in our 50 scheme or up in our 40 scheme. We line him up at nose when he has to be able to play the run and also be able to defend the pass as a backer in our 40 scheme.

We are a gap-control defense in both the 40 and 50 schemes. We try to attack the offense and force them into situations they do not like to be in. We feel that if you have the ball, you have stolen the royal jewels, and we want it back. We want every offense that we face to feel like a virgin in a house of ill repute. They know they are going to get it, but they do not know when or how bad.

I want to go over how we call our defenses and change our alignments. Coach Hensley talked about our alignment for our down linemen and how they move and stunt with our calls. I will cover the base 40 and some alignments and stunts that we use.

We play three basic coverages in our secondary. Our 1 call is man to man. The 2 call is two deep. The 3 call is our three-deep zone.

Our Mike, Will, and Sam backers get their alignment by our line call. If we are in a 40, the call will be 413, 423, or 433. The first number is what defense we will be in: 4 means 40. The second number sets our linemen: 1 shade, 2 head-up, 3 shade. The last number-1, 2, or 3-tells our secondary what they are playing. Here are some examples.

CALL 413

CALL 433
