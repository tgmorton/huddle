If the offense stays in an I formation or strong set, we can call "Mike scrape." That allows the Mike linebacker to run a stunt with the 3-technique tackle. The 3-technique tackle slants back into the 1 gap, and the Mike linebacker runs through the 3 gap.

The Mike linebacker makes the call off the offensive set. How many times have you broken the huddle and wished you had called another defense? Let Mike call the defense, and you have a chance to stop the play.

Last year we had a hard time stopping the run. We had to commit to an eight-man front and play cover one, man coverage, in the secondary. We call our eight-man adjustments "one-free." This means that at the last minute the Mike and Will linebackers are going to slide a little bit to the weak side. The end to the weak side would normally, on a running play, bounce the zone play. Since the free safety is gone and cannot support, the end has to box and contain to his side. He plays outside in and keeps the ball inside. When you check to man coverage, the end has a different responsibility.

You can kick the defense to the weak side and get the same eight-man front. We overshift the front to a 3-and-5 technique to the weak side and a 1-and-5 technique to the strong side. The Sam linebacker shifts up into a 9 technique. Mike and Will linebackers stack in the 3 and 1 gaps, and the strong safety walks up to the 7 technique on the tight end.

Defense is an attitude. But you have to practice that. In your philosophy you have to simplify the calls you are going to make. We want kids to be aggressive, not cautious. There are three phases of football. We have offense, defense, and the special teams. Set individual goals with your kids, especially on special teams. If you win in your special-teams play, you have a chance to win the football game. Special teams are a major factor in winning a football game. You have to emphasize that phase of the game.

I measure defense by no points on the board. I understand that teams kick field goals. But they have to drive to get into position to kick a field goal. Never give in to a situation. Try to make your guys play harder when they meet adverse situations and sudden changes. Defense wins championships. Offense wins games. Make sure you build your defense first.

We run the "pursuit drill" to improve our defensive team. The defensive coach gets in the middle of the field, calls the defense, and then watches his team react. We film this and make sure every kid gets the proper angle going in his pursuit responsibility. The kids are conditioning as well as learning. With everything that you do in football, try to make your guys think. They are sprinting, but there is a purpose to what they are doing. They have to think. It is a good drill because they are reacting to the takeoff, sprinting to the ball, and sprinting off the field.

Another drill we use with our defensive team is the "intercept drill." We call the defense and let the defense react with pass rush and coverage. We throw the ball downfield where a defensive back will intercept. He returns the ball, and everyone has to react to that side of the field, get in front of the ball, and escort it up the sideline.

We do the same things with our offense. We like upand-run goal-line drives. We huddle them, snap the
