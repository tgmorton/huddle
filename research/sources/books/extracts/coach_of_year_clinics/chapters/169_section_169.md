KICKING

Hold opponent inside 30 on kickoff

Score five extra points or

Kick three extra points

Block any kick or punt

Return all kickoffs beyond 35

We play our starters on our kicking teams. We feel that you will lose if you don't do that in our league. Our quarterback returns punts for us. That is the way we do things. I believe in that, and I will always do it that way. We give special awards to our kicking teams.

I will put up some stats to give you an idea of how we did this past year. This may give you some ideas of the stats we are interested in.

KICK SCORING

Pat49 of 52

Field goals7 of 15

Of the eight field goals we missed, four of them were from 50 yards or more. We tried unsuccessfully 52-, 55-, 62-, and 67-yard field goals. We had a kid with a very strong leg, so we gave it a try. He did not make the long ones. The 62-yard try was wide.

You do not have to be really smart to figure out that if we scored an average of 30 points and only gave up 11.9 per game, we are going to win some games.

I felt we had the best defense in the state of Ohio this past year. In our keys to victory, you saw that we tried to block every punt. We do not set up walls. We go after the punt. If we block them, good; if not, our quarterback will fair-catch them.

This is what we do. We hit every day that we are in pads. I am talking about getting after it. I will talk about line play later. But our linemen go over to the chutes and on the boards. We put our first- and second-team players over there every day. We did this in our first game and in game 14. We go one versus one. We practice the same in week 1 as the last week. Our kids are aggressive, and we believe in hitting every day. They like that style of practice. We do not let the seniors beat the heck out of JVs in practice.

We run block 75 percent of the time. We threw for 1600 yards this past year, but we work a lot on the run block. We condition our linemen the same as our running backs and wide receivers.

Here are some things we do not do. I am not saying that what we do is the right thing. We do not lift weights much during the football season. We do not get onto the practice field until 4:15. In our area it is dark by 6:30. Our practice facility is away from our school, so we do not mess around with the weights.

We do not watch videos with our kids. Our kids did not watch tapes on the teams we were going to play during the year. We do not use dummies for our blocking drills. We block people.

We do not teach a backup blocking technique. You will not see us hinge-blocking and setting back in our
