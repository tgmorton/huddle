We want to set the ball high. Next, we must step toward the target. We want to throw the ball with finger rotation. We want RPMs on the ball. And last but not least, we want to follow through to the target.

The second problem is that they are unbalanced after the drop. The front shoulder should be up.

The third problem is that the lead arm folds. This does not do them any good. We want to make sure that the lead arm pulls them through.

Next I want to talk about the two-man game. This is where we break the routes down. The first thing we do that is different from what most people do is that we put the tailback in the halfback position behind the tight end. Most teams put their fullback in that position. We move our tailback to that position. We have our tailback and tight end working together. Our fullback goes to the split-end side. This is a standard set for us, especially in a passing situation. I want to break it down, take about three individual routes, and go over them.

First is the flat route. The depth of a flat route is 3 yards from the line of scrimmage. If the tailback is deeper than 3 yards, he is wrong. We stress width. We say width is more important than depth. He wants to reach the line of scrimmage 3 yards outside the tight end. After he gets to the 3-yard area, he should bend it outside. As soon as he reaches the line of scrimmage, he must snap the head around and look for the ball. More important than depth is for the tailback to get leverage on the Sam linebacker.

FLAT ROUTE

The choice route is run by the fullback. He goes to a depth of 4 yards versus a zone and 6 yards against man coverage. When he reaches the line of scrimmage, he wants to be 4 yards outside the tackle's alignment. Against the zone, he wants to snap his head to the outside and anchor his feet to the ground. Against man coverage, he wants to get vertical and give the Will linebacker a jab step to the inside. The key to the route is to get vertical. If he does not get vertical, he does not have a chance out there.

CHOICE ROUTE

Next is our option route by our tight end. All of these routes can be run out of all three wideouts. This route is for the inside receiver. The depth is 6 to 8 yards. It is a backyard route. The receiver does just the opposite of what the linebacker does. The receiver has three options. (1) If the linebacker walls the receiver off, he must plant and break to the outside. He wants to lean back to the quarterback. (2) If the linebacker drops over the top of the receiver, he hooks to the inside. (3) If the receiver passes the linebacker, he turns back to the inside.

OPTION ROUTE

If we make a quick-five call, our quarterback is going to take five quick steps and shift his weight to this back foot and throw the football right now. This is our two-man game. His first option is to read the Sam linebacker. If we have Sam outflanked, we want to throw the ball to that receiver. We throw that route until they change the defense. A quick five to us is usually a 5- to 6-yard drop of our quarterback, but we are getting the ball away very quickly.

If Sam has our first receiver covered, the quarterback will reset and throw the option route. If the option
