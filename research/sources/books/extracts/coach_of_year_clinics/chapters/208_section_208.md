As we get the ball up high, our vision is going to be focused down the field. I want them to look downfield and focus in on something. This is where peripheral vision comes into play. I want to see the field. I want to know where people are coming from. We do not want to be looking down at the bags we are stepping over. I want to work on my peripheral vision in the drill.

As they come over the last bag, we have a manager about 8 yards from the last bag. As the back comes over the last bag, he wants to beat the manager with a speed move. He must accelerate hard at an angle to beat the manager, who is simulating a safety. After he passes the manager, he accelerates up the field for another 7 to 8 yards. We are working on ball technique and high knees, and we are working on our vision. We work on a cut, and finally we are working on acceleration. I have seen drills where the players would get over that last dummy, turn, and jog back to the end of the line. We do not want that. The difference in your backs going for a long run may be a result of acceleration, so we work hard on this at the end of the bags. As soon as the back makes his cut, he accelerates as hard as he can. As soon as he has the man beat at the narrowest margin, he is straight up the field. He does not want to continue at an angle toward the sideline, where he gets pinned out of bounds on the 3- or 4-yard line. We want to try to beat the pursuit angles immediately after we beat the defender upfield with hard acceleration.

In the next drill, we turn sideways and go over the bags so that both feet hit between the bags. As we come off the last bag, I move the manager up about 4 yards from the last bag. I have to give him a head fake and a shoulder fake in one direction to get him leaning one way, and then I have to beat him. He is too close to beat him with a spin move.

On the third drill, we face the opposite direction stepping over the bags. I have the manager almost on top of the back as he comes off the last bag. The manager pops him with a push-back dummy. As the manager pops the back, he gets in a really tight spin move. We spin so that we gain ground on the spin move. We want to spin the ball away from the defender. We want to spin, gain ground, and get up the field. The reason we work on the spin move is this. There are times in a ball game when you have a breakdown up front. You get the ball, and the defense is right in your face. You do not have a chance to do anything else but spin and turn to try to get upfield.

The next day, we do three bag drills. This time we are going to do the stutter drill. This time we go over the bags and stutter our feet in between the bags as we cross the bags.

This drill teaches body control. When they first start this drill, they have problems. As they stutter the feet, the rest of their body is moving forward. That is the way most backs are. They get the ball and want to score. This helps control their body as they go over the bags.

The next time, we will stay sideways and step over the bag with both feet. On the next bag, we step over with one foot and then twist over the other bags.

The third time, we shuffle over the bags and then accelerate as we come off the bags. We do some bag work every day except the day before the game. These drills take only a couple of minutes.

The next thing we do is to go through what we call our three-step cuts. The reason we do this drill is because I want our backs to be upfield runners. I want them to think about making the quick, hard, sharp cut. I do not want a lot of stutter stepping. I want them to make the quick, hard move up the field. We set cones about four steps apart. We start off running three steps and then plant, three steps and plant, up and down the field. We want hard, quick, slashing moves.
