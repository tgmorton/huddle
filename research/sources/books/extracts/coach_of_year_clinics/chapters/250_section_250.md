toward the man inside. The big trouble we have with our tackle is getting in too wide a stance. When he takes the lead step, he has to bring his back foot underneath him to get balance. It is just enough time to give the defense a chance to react. We want to shorten up the stance and step directly at the defender. We will get some help from the center in case the man slants back inside. The tackle can aim a little higher because he knows he has help coming from his center. The onside guard pulls and traps the first thing outside of our tackle. If we have an eagle look, we are going to trap the 7 technique lined up on our tight end. On the option, if we get a 7 technique on our end, we will have the end block him. When we run the trap, we are going to trap him with our guard.

TRAP VS. SPLIT 6 (4-4)

I know that it looks like an easy block with the tackle on the inside man, but that man can do a lot of things that make it difficult to block him. That is why we have our center help the tackle.

If the tight end has a 9 technique, he will release underneath. If he has a 7 technique on him, he goes to the outside. When the tight end has to go outside, the pulling guard hugs the line a little closer. He breaks off the block of the tight end. Again, at times the play will break, and we do not even have to touch the linebacker because he is running outside to play the option.

Against the 4-3 front, the play is very similar to the 44 front. We pin block with the tackle. We pull the center to help on the down defender. The onside guard kicks out on the end.

TRAP VS. 4-3 FRONT

If we want to bring the flanker back in motion and have him crack back on the linebacker, the tight end comes down inside. The flanker is also involved in the passing game and runs several routes from this motion.

TRAP WITH MOTION VS. 4-3 FRONT

That is how we would run our fullback trap off tackle. What happens at times on the play, especially on the 4-3 front, is that the defensive end will slant down inside, with our tight end releasing inside. What we do then is to have the tight end jump the end on his slant. Then we just bring the guard around for the first linebacker. If the defensive end lines up inside our tight end, we will release around him. We do not have our end block him on the trap if he lines up inside.
