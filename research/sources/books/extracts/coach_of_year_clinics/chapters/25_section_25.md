The next area is what we list as playing time and our JV system. We guarantee our freshmen, sophomores, and juniors that they will start somewhere on the JV team. We keep the players and parents happy that way. Also, we are building up the team for next year. This increases enthusiasm and helps the players develop a good attitude about the game. We are a Class A school, but we play Class AA and AAA teams on the JV level. We do not guarantee the seniors anything.

On the varsity level we use all of our one-way starters and our best JVs on our special teams. Now, this ties more players to the varsity level. As far as counting quarters, the kicking game does not count, so we can get kids in the game who are not starters.

Let me talk about the seniors. Next year we will have about 18 seniors. We do not have captains. All of our seniors are captains. Each year I have the seniors over to my house for steaks. We talk about leadership, tradition, and our expectations. We do everything we can to play seniors. We cannot guarantee that they will start. Our seniors expect their best year next year because we had a good year this past year.

The next area relates to penalties, turnovers, execution, and fundamentals. We teach the rules. You would be surprised to find out what your players do not know about the rules, especially in the kicking game.

We really stress turnovers just as you do. We stress taking care of the football on offense and creating opportunities on defense. This past year we were plus28 in turnovers. We teach fundamentals and stress them all of the time. One way we do this is with the perfect play drill. Instead of running sprints, one day we will tell the team they must run five perfect plays before they can go in. As the coach, you can decide how perfect the plays are. It depends on how hard you want to work them at the end of practice.

This next area may be something that a lot of you do not believe in, but we do not hit much in practice. Once the season starts, we hit for only five minutes for the week, and that is it. We play most of our games on Saturday. I think we have two games on Friday night. We have very few injuries. We may go down on the goal line, put our best 22 kids against each other, and go live for 10 plays.

We have most of our JV games on Monday. Our varsity will watch film and go out and stretch. We may not even go out on Monday. We practice Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Some days we do not practice on Friday because we go to scout other teams. Some of the teams we play are four hours away, so we go scout them and do not practice on Friday before a Saturday game.

Let me list some results of not hitting so much after the season starts. (1) We have very few injuries. We want our best players playing on Friday night or Saturday. (2) It keeps the moms happy. (3) It keeps the players fresh. They are mentally and physically fresh. (4) The game becomes special to the players. It is more than just someone new to hit and another chance to wear the game uniform. On Wednesday or Thursday after the JVs have played on Monday, we may take them at the end of practice and hit for 15 to 20 minutes. (5) It allows us to gear up for 13 games and a longer season.

There is one drawback to this hitting rule. We do not block or tackle well early in the year. We know this going into the year.

We do not let our freshman kids go live against the varsity players. We want to protect the freshmen at all times. We do not want to run off any players. You do not know the type of player a freshman will make. We want to keep as many players as we can, not run them off.

We use an off-season scouting report. We use last year's films. First, we scout ourselves. We look at our personnel. We look to see what we did right and what we need to improve on. We take a look at the plays to see whether we need to change or add or drop plays for the next year.

We scout our opponents. We look at their personnel and their offense, defense, and kicking game. We do
