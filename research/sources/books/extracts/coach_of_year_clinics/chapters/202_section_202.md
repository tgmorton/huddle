ball and finish. If your player is doing this the correct way, there will be times when he falls right on his butt. His power will take him through the kick. The punter presents the ball as if he were going to kick it. As he presents the ball, the coach or manager takes the ball, but the punter continues his motion as if he were going to kick the ball. When the plant foot is put down, there should be about a 30-degree bend in the knee. The power leg or punting leg will actually be almost touching his butt as he fires up through the ball. As the leg comes from almost touching his butt to the explosion, contact will be made around the knees. This lets the punter experience the full extension of the leg. This is like swinging a weighted bat. He is really going after the ball, but all of a sudden there is no ball there, so he finishes pretty high.

Next, let's look at the placement of the ball on the foot. When the punter's foot is locked and straight, there is only about four inches of the ball that actually makes contact with the foot. That is because the ball is not flat. The ball is dropped on the laces of the shoe. Because it is dropped slightly down and inside, there is more surface to hit.

I am not concerned about the spiral of the ball. I want the ball 40 yards downfield every time it is punted. I don't care if the ball doesn't shoot out like a gun. We would like to have that, but if it doesn't, that is okay. As long as the punter's mechanics are all right, the ball will go downfield 40 yards. If you want the ball to turn over, the punter has to drop the nose of the ball more. By dropping the nose of the ball, the fit on the foot is better, and the angle is better. If the ball is kicked high, the punter is overstriding and has his weight back.

If the ball is kicked to the right, that means the ball is dropped on the outside of the foot. If the ball goes left, the ball was dropped on the inside of his foot. When I watch punters from the front, I can tell you by the way the ball comes off the foot whether it went left or right.

Let me go over some steps for you. Punters are generally a 2-, 2.5-, 3-, or 3.5-step punter. You don't want to be a 3- or 3.5-step punter. If I am a true 2-step punter, I am going right, left, and punt. If I am a 2.5-step punter, I have a jab step to get going. I punt with a right, left, and left step pattern.

[Question] The question was about a bad snap? The first thing that we tell the punter is to get the ball. If the ball is left, he moves his whole body behind the ball. Don't just reach. If we are going to kick the ball downfield, we have to get straight behind the ball. If he doesn't move behind the ball, his momentum will be carried the way the ball is snapped.

Here is a drill to teach a punter how to punt. Get two

punters facing each other about 5 yards apart. Have them play pepper with each other. When I talk about pepper, it is the game you play in baseball. In punting, all you are doing is teaching your punter how to control the ball. Don't worry about the spiral. All I want to do is control the ball. Work on presenting the ball and dropping it. I'm watching the ball. If it goes left, it came off the inside of my foot. If it goes right, it is the outside. It is one step and drop. After we develop some skill with the 5-yard distance, we start to increase the distance apart up to 20 yards.

To make a point, I make the punter close his eyes. With his eyes closed, I make him kick the ball. If he can't do it, his drop is not consistent. He can do it if he steps down the line, has a consistent drop, and swings his leg down the line.

During the seat drill, the punter gets so good that he can stop the ball as it is being snapped to him and not have to make any adjustments to it before he kicks. He has to focus and concentrate on the ball, but his hand-eye coordination will let him do it.

We watch the punter's head. We draw a straight line from his head. As he receives the ball, seats it, and steps forward, his head should not go up and down. It should remain level throughout the approach. As he presents the ball, he does not pull it up or down. If the head goes up on the first step, it means his heel is out. I stand to the right of the punter. As he receives the ball and presents it, if he raises the ball up, I'll slap it out of his hands. The ball is not raised or lowered throughout the kick. They work on the level presentation during the pepper drill also.
