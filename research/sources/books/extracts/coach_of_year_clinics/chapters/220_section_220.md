Developing a Philosophy and a System

Clemson University

The first thing I want to talk about is what we have done at Clemson. We have found over the years that, regardless of what you do, you had better have a plan. You had better stick to your plan. We have developed some things at Clemson that we stick to. We have an overall philosophy, we have a football philosophy, and then we have a system. Our philosophies are set in stone. They do not change. We will always keep those philosophies. Our system will change.

When we first started at Clemson, our staff started talking about philosophy. We said that we were going to build upon a philosophy that will win. That is the bottom line: We wanted results. We decided to break down the philosophy into two areas. We have an overall philosophy and a football philosophy. We all know what wins. Generally, about 90 percent of the time, the teams with the best players win. We have an advantage over you in that we can recruit. However, at times, that may not be an advantage. We all know the best players win. What if you do not have the best players? You cannot just throw in the towel and say that you do not have players as good as the opponents. In our overall development, we have developed our philosophy so that talent does not have anything to do with winning.

The second part of our philosophy is that we feel we must sell our program to the players. Our players must believe in the overall and football philosophies. We started from day one three years ago selling our philosophy of how we were going to win games and eventually win our conference.

The third part was to be committed to the philosophy. I feel this point is critical. You and your staff have to be totally committed to the way you are going to win. That may sound good, but we really are committed. It does not matter whether you are the head coach, assistant coach, trainer, or manager, you have to be totally committed and understand what our philosophies are. "This is how we are going to do things, and this is how we are going to win football games." People in our program know our philosophy, are totally committed, and believe that we will win. Our team believes they will win.

In our overall philosophy, we said our first goal is toughness. That is number one in our overall philosophy. I will tell you why it is that way. I truly believe that this game has never changed. The game that we have been a part of all of our lives and the game that we love has never changed. It has never changed. People have changed, players have changed, coaches have changed, but our game has never changed. It is still a game of blocking, tackling, and fundamentals. There is no way around toughness in football. There may be in some other sports. We are in the only sport where contact is not a penalty. In our sport when two players knock the heck out of each other, the fans stand and cheer. In any other sport, it is a foul or penalty. There is no way around toughness in our game. We preach to our team that we are going to outhit our opponents for four quarters. That is a big point for us. This does not guarantee that we are going to win the game. This is only going to guarantee us a chance to win. That is the mental part of the game. We talk about mental toughness and physical toughness. We preach this every day. That is how we are going to win. Toughness is a key part of our game and is what we believe in.

I believe toughness is a part of consistency. If your kids are tough and they believe that they are tough, they will practice that way. I think that breeds consistency. You do not have games where you are up high for one game and down low for the next game. If you are tough and your kids believe it, I think it breeds consistency. Toughness is number one in our program.

The second point in our overall philosophy is conditioning. We are totally committed to conditioning as a staff and as a team. Our team believes in conditioning. They did not believe in it at first, I can
