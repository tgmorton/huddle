sixth 130, we have players racing. It takes them about six to get back into it. You have to leave the nervous system with a feeling of speed and a feeling of being explosive. If you don't, the nervous system will be very strong and very slow, or it will be very strong and nonexplosive. It is the total key to everything you do.

What does the nervous system have to do with it? You have to train one body part by taking two days off and training the body part. Yes and no. Yes, if you max out. You would not want to come back the next day and go max squats or heavy cleans. No, that will not work. You would hurt someone.

Let's look at the key to nervous system training. How can women come to college, after five years weigh the same, but lift 100 pounds more in a squat? How can that happen? With guys, don't you have to get the muscle bigger to get stronger? No, it is the nervous system.

We used to get ready for a football season. Around the 4th of July we started getting ready. That is what we used to do. Now, in college, you go to year-round school. In June, you are in summer school. Why? You must have a good graduation rate. You better have players in condition. You better not get players hurt because you have only 85 scholarships. How do you do this? You put them in summer school in June and July. You have eight or nine weeks of lifting and running. You can get them in good shape. Say you go to a camp. They have eight or nine weeks in the summer. Then you have fall, which is 16 weeks long. Then in college, we have bowl preparation, which is another month. Now we are up to 28 to 29 weeks of the 52. Then you get two weeks off. Then they come back, and you are into the off-season program for nine weeks. Now we are at 37 weeks. Then we have spring practice that last four weeks. Now we are at 41 weeks. Then comes May. The older players work out in May for three weeks. Now you are at 44 weeks out of the 52 that players are training. It is year-round training now. In college it is, and it is in a lot of high schools. You have to train year round. Do you think Michael Johnson takes six months n the off-season? He takes about six days off. He starts doing things, not necessarily track work, but he starts working. You have to train year round, but when we come up to play Michigan in the fall, it still comes down to who has the best players. I think we are still working on that part of it.

Now we will get into some practical things. Let's review the work for the week. On Monday we do footwork, we do core work, and we do what we call pre-hab, which we get from the trainers and the physical therapist. Now, if we can do certain exercises before they get hurt, perhaps they will not get hurt, or if they do get hurt, the injury will not be as bad and they will recover from the injury more quickly. We finish our warm-up with loosening. I will cover all of this really quickly. Everyone knows what the speed-agility ladder is. We do that at least once a week. We do all kinds of drills. The players even make up drills. We make it fun for them, but we make it fast. We finish with that type of activity. Then they are jazzed up and ready to go.

Another thing we do is called line hops. We take tape and put it on the floor, or we will take a stripe on the floor or on the field, and we do little hops. It is basic plyometrics, but it is also knee and ankle rehab. We take a spot, and we hop to it. We hop forward, and we hop backward. We hop staying on the stripe. We go zigzag forward and then backward, staying off the stripe. We go laterally. We just keep going back and forth. We do hammer: "Don't touch the stripe moving forward." When they get good, we have them move the hands inside,just as a sprinter does. We are always coaching sprint technique.

When they get bored with that, we go a third of the way down the stripe and put a dot, line, or mark. We go another third of the stripe and put a dot, line, or mark. It is the same drills, but now we have them pause at the dots and stick it or touch it. Why is that important? If I am not a knee bender, I cannot play football. If I am not a knee bender, I can't stop. If I am not a knee bender, that is how I blow out my anterior cruciate ligament. We use this especially with our big guys who have big quads. Really quick, you have heard the statement about the old lineman. He can't play because he can't bend at the waist. We stress posture
