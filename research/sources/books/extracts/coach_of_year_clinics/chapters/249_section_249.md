The Trap and Trap-Option Package

University of Nebraska

It is my pleasure to share with you our trapping game and the option off those traps. Last Wednesday, when I left Nebraska, it was snowing. Coming over, I kept thinking how good my nine iron was going to be. It is a great experience coming to Hawaii. The coaches here understand football and make a great effort to learn.

I know that some of you do not run the option. I am sure that most of you run some type of trap. If you don't do it, you can at least learn what we are doing at Nebraska, and hopefully that will help you. We have had a lot of success in the last four years. We won the national championship in 1995. For those last four years, we have a 47-2 record.

I would like to comment on the job Earl Browning has done getting this clinic started. Also, Tom Cheaney and Ed Roach have helped put the Hawaii clinic together. Rick Sakata has done a lot of work behind the scenes. I know it takes a lot to get these programs started. Getting everything organized takes a lot of effort. I want them to know we appreciate the effort.

I want to go over three of our traps and two of the options that come off the traps. The first trap is the one we run off tackle. We trap the first offensive defender outside of our offensive tackle. The fullback aims at the butt of the offensive tackle and reads the tight end. The fullback gets the ball, although we do run the play from a one-back set. We give it to our I back and run the same blocking scheme. Against the 50 front, we are going to have our onside tackle step with his right foot and chip the defensive tackle. Then he comes off on the linebacker plugging, back to the noseguard running, to the backside linebacker. We have the tight end come down and aim high because he is getting help with his offensive tackle. Then the end works upfield.

Against the 50 front, the onside guard is going to pull. He is really going to climb the hole. He is going to try to get the rush end kicked out. What happens is this. As the tight end squeezes down, the defensive end closes down with the end. We really have to climb the hole to get it kicked out. If we face the even front, we pull our guard a little flatter. If it is an odd front, we really climb the end to get him kicked out.

Again, the fullback is going to come off the butt of the tight end who is off his down block. The quarterback will reverse out with a three-quarters turn. We are going to run option action with the tailback and quarterback. We hope to get underneath the onside linebacker if we run the option play enough. Hopefully, he will widen, looking for the option. We set the play up by running the option play a number of times. On the 50 front, we have to fool the frontside linebacker and get underneath him. On the back side, we pull our guard around and try to get our center to cut off to the back side.

If the frontside tackle has a defender on his inside, we have him communicate this to the tight end. The tackle will down-block, and the tight end will block the tackle. We will have the wide receiver go in motion and block down on the first linebacker. He has a double read. He can block on the first linebacker to show or the strong safety coming up.

TRAP VS. 50 FRONT

Against the even look, say, a 6-2 or 4-4 front, we come down with our tackle. He steps down with his lead foot
