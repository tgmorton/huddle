it again. One point I learned from Bo Schembechler at Michigan is this: You better believe in everything that you do, and you had better be ready to sell it to everyone involved. If you can't do that, you will never be successful. When I first became the defensive coordinator in my first two years at Mt. Carmel High School, we were a Rip-and-Liz, power-I football team. People told me that I would be fired in two years if I tried to run an option offense in our conference. We can knock on wood, because we have had good kids and they have been able to overcome my coaching. We are still at Mt. Carmel after 13 years.

It is important to maintain good line splits on the goal line. How many of you here today tell your players on offense to close their splits down when the defense gets in the gaps? We do not tell our kids to cut their splits down because the defense is in the gaps. We want good line splits because gap defenses give us good angles. That does not mean that you have to run every play in your offense down on the goal line. Run the plays that are going to be conducive to success on the goal line. Don't run plays that you are going to have a hard time being successful on.

Eliminate mistakes on the goal line. This includes fumbles and penalties. Missed assignments mean stops. Everyone in this room knows this, but do we coach our kids in that manner? Do we teach the kids these things? Stop the stoppers. We do not want things that are going to stop us on the goal line. We want to eliminate them in practice.

We want to control the line of scrimmage. If the defense does penetrate, we want to use it to our advantage. Our number one play on the goal line is our outside veer. If the defense tries to pinch the tackle and end down inside to stop the outside veer, we look at the next phase of plays that we want to go to in order to be successful. If the defense takes away A, are we good enough to go to B? If they can take away A and B, do we have C available? We want to sustain our blocks and block lower on the goal line. We want to get the shoulders into the end zone. We want movement at the point of attack. We tell our linemen to finish the play with their shoulders over the end zone. This is particularly true from the 5-yard line on in. Think about it, coach. If I coach the line to finish the play with their shoulders in the end zone, where will the back probably be? Right behind the linemen in the end zone. We tell our linemen that they are successful if they finish the play with their shoulders in the end zone.

We will use all four backs, so we can run our plays to either side with equal speed, deception, finesse, and power. I will show you this in our tape. We run the same plays but block them a little differently. We insist that our backs run low and harder through the end zone. Here are a couple of coaching points. How many times have you seen the backs run into the line at the 5-yard line with their heads down? If your eyes are down and you get hit, your body is going down. The first thing we teach our kids is to get their eyes up and to look for the back of the end zone. It does not matter if you are running 8 yards or 80 yards, our kids are going to run through the back of the end zone. The back has a better chance of staying up if he has his eyes up, looking for the back of the end zone. Most people tell their backs to tuck the ball away and to get the front hand over the ball. We tell our backs to get the ball in front of them on the goal line. We want the pads down, eyes up, and the ball in front on the chest with one or two hands on the ball.

We want to throw the play-action pass off our most effective runs. We use crossing patterns versus man coverage. Because we are an option team, we like to use dump and curl routes. These things fit our scheme. You have to decide what will fit in with your scheme. Throw the play-action pass off your most effective runs. That is a big key.

We want to keep pressure on the defense. Our tempo must be at its best. When we get inside your 20, we want them excited. We want a sense of urgency. We are trying to get the plays in as fast as we can. We want to create a sense of urgency, and we do not want to give the defense a chance to rest. Our kids are going to hustle up to the line and get down, and they are going to go. We are going to get after them as quickly as we possibly can. Again, what we want to do is to keep the pressure on the defense.
