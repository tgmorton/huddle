We have a stopwatch on the quarterback because we do not want him to hold the ball too long. We want the ball gone in less than 2.8 seconds.

Next, we work on a combo route. We have two receivers going against two defenders: a safety and a corner. The defense will play what we call a two-read coverage, or they will be playing quarters. It gives our receivers a chance to see what the defense is doing with their coverage. Myself, I like to get the linebackers involved in the defense. We add them to the drill later on.

The next drill is with our tight end, tailback, and fullback against three linebackers. We call this the Dallas drill. The defense can play their different coverages as we run our different routes against them.

Then we go to our skeleton drill. This is where we bring our skilled people on offense to go against the entire defensive secondary. This is our team passing drill. This is our best drill. We never want our quarterback to get hit in this drill. He must stand in the pocket and throw the football. Then we go to an 11-on-11 drill. This is where we let it all out, and the quarterback must make the play.

We keep an accuracy percentage on our quarterbacks. Also, we keep a completion percentage on them. If the pass is dropped by a receiver, it is counted as a completion for us in this chart.

If the ball is batted-and we see this in the film-I give them the benefit of the doubt and count it as a completion. If the quarterback throws the ball away to prevent a sack, we do not count it as anything. It is not counted as a catch or an attempt. Every day in practice we have a goal for the type of passes we throw.

Last year, our quarterback had a passing accuracy of 77 percent. He did a good job of getting rid of the ball, although we had several passes dropped.

Next, I want to get into the drills for our quarterbacks. We are going to do four drills every day before practice. A lot of you have been to our camp and know these four drills. I do not want my quarterbacks to warm up unless I am out there with them. I do not want them to get into any bad habits. I want to be with them when they are warming up.

1. Toes-on drillWe want the quarterback to put his toes on the line about shoulders' width apart. The quarterbacks are going to be 10 yards apart. We want the quarterback to rotate his shoulders and use his upper body. His feet should never leave the ground. We want him to set the ball, turn the hips, and work on the shoulder rotation. He must come over the top with the ball. He rotates his shoulders from one sideline to the other sideline. This drill helps them to get loose. We really stress setting the ball. We want the ball up high on the drill.

2. Weight-shift drillThe quarterbacks are still 10 yards apart. They take their back foot and put it on the line. We do not want them to rock all the way back, but we do want them to shift their weight. We talk to them about finishing the throw just as they would if they were a baseball pitcher. We want them to transfer the weight, take a six- to eight-inch stride, and set the foot. Again, we stress the follow-through.

3. Step-n-strideAgain, the quarterbacks are going to put their foot on the back line, take a short stride toward the target, and throw. They are working on a short stride, and they are standing tall. Again, we concentrate on the follow-through. They are just like a baseball pitcher. We want them to come over the top.

4. Crossover plantWe simulate being at the top of our drop. Now we are going to cross over and plant the foot and throw the football. We stress balance and the weight transfer with the shoulders level. The most important step in the drop for the quarterback is the fourth step. He has
