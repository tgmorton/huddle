it play selection? Was it because of poor mechanics on the part of the quarterback? Was it because of fundamentals of throwing, catching, or pass protection?

Penalties will stop you from scoring on the goal line. Concentration mistakes can't be tolerated. Your starting count must not be too complicated. You cannot have too much in the cadence.

You should evaluate your first-down calls. Make sure you self-scout. Know what you like to do on offense. Review your play-selection philosophy. Do not just grab plays that you like. Decide whether you are going to attack alignment or personnel. You need to use the press box for help. Are we getting the expected look? Are we seeing the defense we worked against in practice? We have gotten very good in our goal-line offense over the last several years, so that teams are now playing us with their regular defense inside the 10-yard line. They are using their base defense to try to stop the things that we do best on the goal line.

You need to be aware of the clock when you are on the goal line. Do you have a no-huddle stop-the-clock play? Do you have a two-play sequence that you can run from the line of scrimmage? It could be run-run, run-pass, pass-run, or pass-pass. We give our two-play sequence a name. We call it 
caravan. 
You can call it whatever you want. You must prepare for a situation when you do not have time to call two plays.

Next, I want to get to our goal-line offense. Later we will talk about practice time. Our 36 and 37 outside veer is the best short-yardage and goal-line play we have. This is our version of a power off-tackle play. We are a split-back-veer team, but we usually get a double team at the point of attack if we have a tight end in the home position. Our quarterback has one read and one reaction. We are going to read the end on the line of scrimmage, and we react to the defensive back or linebacker, whoever is the next man to show up. We have one read and one reaction. If you are going to run option football and tell the quarterback that he has two reads, you are whistling in the wind. That is not going to happen. It is too much to ask of a quarterback. We ask him to make one read and one reaction. If we run the play correctly, the outside veer will result in a three-on-two advantage. You do not have to be a great option team to run that play. We are going to combo or double-team at the point of attack. Again, it is our power off-tackle play.

I want to make sure we talk about practice time. Our weekly goal-line package is a limited version of our base offense. This allows us to minimize our goal-line practice, concentrate on potential problem situations, and perfect our execution.

Here is exactly what we do during the week. We play most of our home games Saturday night. When I was a student at Mt. Carmel, our league played all of our games on Sunday afternoon. When the Chicago Catholic High School started playing football in the 1920s, there was no NFL to compete with. Now our kids always have Sunday off, unless we are playing. Monday is a light day for us. We go out in helmets and shorts. Tuesday is our first weekday in pads. We work 10 minutes on our goal-line offense against any unusual defensive fronts you may show us on the goal line in our next game or against what we think you may show us based on your package. On Wednesday we spend 10 minutes on your base goal-line defense. Once we get into the season, we do very little full contact. We do go live on the goal line. We get after it. It is ones versus our ones. There is less chance in getting someone hurt on the goal line.

When we teach tackling in the preseason, we have one rule. You can never tackle anyone on your own team below the waist. That does two things for us. First, it saves on ankle and knee injuries. Second, it makes our defensive players better tacklers. They have to run to be in position to make tackles. They can't just be diving at people. We never allow anyone to tackle below the waist in practice.

On Thursday our goal-line offense works against any defensive stunts and combinations of fronts you may show. We go over all the possible blitz situations. If we play on Saturday, we will go out in light gear on Friday. We have our helmets and thigh boards on. I do
