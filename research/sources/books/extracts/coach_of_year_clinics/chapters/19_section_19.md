Next, we go to our "blitz pick-up with backs" drill. This is not a high-intensity period. Again, it is scripted; it is geared to what we want that day. I am standing behind the line calling the plays: "Rapid-right 72." We do not have any quarterbacks or receivers in the drill. We get the defense lined up and work against the blitz we expect that week. You may make your guard and center interchangeable. This is the time to work with them. This is not a "get them tired" type drill. It is blitz pickup working on assignments. Again, we are in the no-huddle set. It is a 10-minute scripted drill.

Pass-protection fundamentals are the toughest thing to teach offensive linemen. We work on that 10 to 15 minutes per day. We have the bags, we do the steps, and we do the whole shooting match. We do that 10 to 15 minutes per day.

Then we do our half-line pass protection. Now we go back-to-back. The reason we go half line is because we do not want the big piles at the quarterback. We do not want anyone to get hurt. At the same time we want the quarterback to feel pressure and be able to react.

Last, we do team work for 30 minutes. We do two huddles at once. We go two huddles, and we run the same play. The second group gets to see the play against the defense. That is basically our practice schedule.

We are an I-formation football team. We run the option. If it were not for the option, we would not be where we are today. We have been ranked in the top 10 in our division for the last several years. We believe in hard-nosed football. A hard-nosed offense makes for a hard-nosed defense. There is no question, you win championships with defense. We believe that, and I am an offensive coach and have been for years. How do you get good defense? You do that by recruiting good players and by being hard-nosed on offense.

We run the toss sweep. We run it strong and weak. We believe in the toss sweep. We have good backs that can run, and we have fullbacks that can block. We do a little scheming, but not very much. We run the isolation series. We will run the ball right dead at you. It is hard-nosed "iso" downhill. We come off the ball and hit them in the mouth.

We have gone to a one-back zone play. It has been good for us. We run the wide, tight, and cutback. We call them wide, tight, and cutback. We do not get real fancy with it.

We have been fortunate to have had good fullbacks. We run four plays with the fullback. We run the belly, trap, dive, and cutback. We fake-sweep and give it to the fullback on the cutback.

We do run the option. We believe in the option. I have heard a lot of coaches say they did not want to run the option because they did not want to get the quarterback hit. We believe in the option, so we run it. We run the option with the fullback and quarterback, and we pitch the football.

We believe in the triple option. We work on the triple option every day during the two-a-days for 10 minutes. We go half line for 10 minutes. We have two quarterbacks running the drills. The most important thing is coaching the scout team. During the season we work twice a week on the option, going half line. On Tuesday and Wednesday we have the pads on, so we go 10 minutes per day on half-line option drills. We work very little on the double and speed options.

We run the belly option. Basically, it is a quarterback sweep play. We pull the guard and log or hook the end. We can run the play to the strong or weak side. The fullback is on the linebacker. The quarterback reverses out and hauls ass. He wants to get wide and run. The quarterback option is big against the blitz. We believe that this play keeps the blitz down in the two-back set. We can get some big plays off the belly option.

We run the misdirection game. We run the counter gap and pull the guard and tackle on the back side. That is basically our running game.

In our passing game we have basic protections. The toughest one is the drop-back pass. That is the one we spend most of our time on.
