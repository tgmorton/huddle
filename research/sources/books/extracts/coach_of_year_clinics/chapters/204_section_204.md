Running Back Drills and Techniques

University of Nebraska

If you listened to my introduction, you may have noticed that I played fullback at Nebraska. How would you like to be an I back and have me blocking for you? It would be a tough go. I will do everything I can to let you know basically what we are doing drill-wise with our running backs. I will cover the techniques we are teaching and what we are trying to get accomplished with them. Also, I will talk to you about some general things that I think are extremely important in terms of football and winning games.

I have been very fortunate as a coach at Nebraska. I went to Nebraska in 1962. That happened to be the same year that Bob Devaney went there. We started winning when he got there, and we have had a winning season every year since. In our worst two years, we were 6-4, both years.

After I graduated from Nebraska, I got a chance to be the head coach at Holy Name High School in Omaha. I took the job, and without ever coaching a down, I thought I was the best coach that there ever was in the state. I had come through a CYO program in Cleveland, Ohio, where I grew up. Our CYO program there was very successful. Our high school team won the city championship.

I thought I knew everything there was to know about football when I left Nebraska for Holy Name High School. I was very confident when I went into my first game as a coach against what happened to be our arch-rival, Cathedral High School. I gave the team a great pep talk before the game, and I knew we could not lose. We came out on the field and got beat 48-3. It did not take me long to realize that I was not the mastermind of football that I thought I was. I realized that I had a lot of things to learn and a long way to go.

Fortunately, I was around some great people, and I learned a lesson there. If you surround yourself with good people, you are going to have a chance, no matter what you are doing, regardless of whether you are a coach or not. If you surround yourself with good people, as a coach, you will have a chance. If you are a player and you surround yourself with good people and you hang out with good people, you will have more than a good chance.

I was never so dejected in my life as I was after that first loss. I was walking across the field to shake hands with the opposing coach. I had my head down and was asking myself if I was in the right profession. I was wondering how things were going to go for me in the future. About that time, I bumped into a little old lady leaving the game. I said, "Excuse me, ma'am, no offense." She said, "That is right, coach, and you did not have any defense either." That is about the way it was at Holy Name High School. We did not have an offense, and we did not have a defense. We did have a kicking game. We scored 3 points in the kicking game.

At the University of Nebraska, I have been very fortunate to coach in a program where, generally speaking, we have had a good offense, a good defense, and a good kicking game. Can you win the conference championship without all three of those elements? You can, but it is tough to do. Can you win the national championship without all three of those units? You can, but it is very, very tough. We gave it a shot in 1983 against Miami. At that time, our defense was ranked 78th in the country. However, we had a tremendous offense and a tremendous kicking game. We lost to Miami by one point in the national championship game. Other teams may have won the national championship without all three phases of the game. Generally, if you have all three phases, it gives you your best chance. However, having all three phases does not make it automatic.

I want to talk about some things that are very important for all coaches. I feel it would be worthwhile for you to go through a process here that is going to
