It really helped our attack this year to spend some extra time on this play. Let me show you the play, and then I will show you the play on video.

We bring the slot man outside to block the corner. The inside linemen release on the inside linebackers to the safety. Our rule on the option is this: We go block the linebacker or safety. If the linebacker is knocked down, go knock the safety down. If the safety is not there, escort the runner for a touchdown. It is simple for our linemen, and they do a really good job on it.

We have the line block for one half of a second. That is not long. They show pass, and then they go. The quarterback is on his own. He is an athlete. When the defense is coming in, the quarterback must find a way to get the ball to the wide receiver. We want the wide receiver to run straight at the quarterback. We find that we get a better angle that way. He takes one step up and turns and comes back toward the quarterback who is dropping back.

We have run this play out of a three-step drop and the five-step drop. The right tackle must release faster than the other linemen. He only sets for about one fourth of a second. He releases more quickly.

This play is a good way to get the ball to a shifty back and let him do his thing. You can put a real good running back out there and throw him the ball. Let me show the video.
