we can drag those letters out and have the board read them.

(2) We want to communicate to our players at all times. (a) They should know what is expected of them on and off the field. (b) They should know their status. (c) They should know they fit into the program.

(3) Our team should be fundamentally sound and well disciplined. The highest compliment I have gotten is when another coach told me our team was fundamentally sound and well disciplined.

(4) We should improve daily and weekly. We want to learn from the best. You can learn from anyone, but learn from the best. I followed Lloyd Gasket. He won 10 state championships. I do not know how many second places he finished. One thing he taught me was this. He said, "Chris, don't try to change everything." He said, "Bite off a little at a time. Get it done, and then go to the next thing you want to change." Lloyd gave me a lot of ideas.

I was in a coffee club that met at 7:30. Bob Smith was a principal, and he was a three-sports star in high school and college. I think he had 12 letters in college. He was a catcher for the New York Yankee organization. He was at the AAA level. The Yankee catcher hurt his leg, and so Bob was to move up, but he broke his leg. The next guy to move up was Elston Howard.

Don Kimble was our band director. This man never took worse than first in the state. How many of you can say that? That was for 31 years.

Another person I learned from was Warren Mitchell. He won more state championships than anyone else. He won the state in several sports, including football, basketball, and track. We would sit around and talk. I would ask him questions. It is amazing how much you can learn from these people. What I am trying to get across to you is this. You have to find those guys. You can always find someone to talk with.

Another way to learn is by reading. Here is a book on Bear Bryant. It came out in 1974. I still read this book each year before we start football. I think I know it by heart, but I read it anyhow. I am not an Alabama fan, but I am a Bear Bryant fan after reading his book.

You can learn a lot at these clinics. If you ever buy anything, it is this manual. I'm talking about the 
Coach of the Year Clinics Football Manual. 
Here is the first one I got, and it was in 1980. Woody Hayes is on the front cover. If you want to know about history and war, he was the man that knew about it. But he also knew something about football.

I went to see Ohio State when they played Michigan State. Woody was out there in his short-sleeved shirt and black hat. He is the one who started soccer-style kicking. Woody would throw his hat down, and he would kick the sideline markers. Then things would go flying out on the field. I think that is where the soccer-style kicking got started. You can watch games and learn what colleges and other teams are doing. You can scout other teams and learn from them.

Someone asked me what is tradition. We all have tradition. Every school and every coach that has been coaching a while has tradition. To me tradition is how others view your program. It is also how your players, parents, community, and related others view your program. For better or worse, we all have tradition. It does not matter whether you have a winning or a losing program.

The next question is how to get a tradition going. How do you establish your own team tradition? I will give you a few ideas on what we do to establish some of our traditions. One of the things we do is to wear a shirt and tie to games. This includes the coaches as well as the players. We coach in shirts and ties, both home and away games.

Another thing we do is this. The moms make us treats every day during the play-offs. The kids love this. Our kids are like zoo animals. You feed them, and they expect it all of the time.

Another tradition we have relates to the dropkick. Two years ago they were going to take the dropkick out of the rule books and eliminate it from football. I wrote a
