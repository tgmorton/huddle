You can see the areas where we did well and the areas where we did not do well. We use these goals to set up our defense for the season. We stress to our defense that we must get to the football. We ask them this question. What must we do to win? This is what we came up with.

How we will win on defense? Do not allow a long pass completion for a touchdown. Do not allow a long run for a touchdown. Intercept passes and return them for yardage and touchdowns. Force the opponent to fumble.

We stress the fact we must play great goal-line defense. We feel that if we can do that, we have a chance to win. We stress fundamentals on defense. This is what we stress with our players: Shoulders square; proper arm free; pads over our toes; keep a base; don't run around blocker; do not give them anything but pads, bones, and elbows; stay on your feet.

We start with our general techniques. We start every thing from a base. This is what we stress: stance, alignment, key ball to man, responsibility.

This past year we played three different defensive fronts. The first defense we teach is what we call our load 53 defense. We have a tackle call to the tightend side. The tackle and end to the tight end are going to line up in a 3 technique and a 7 technique. On the split-end side we have a tackle in a shade technique and the end in a 5 technique. Our Sam linebacker goes to the tight-end side. The Mike linebacker is on the outside shoulder of the center. The Will linebacker is stacked inside the offensive tackle and behind our 5technique end. As you can see, we are based out of the 4-3 alignment. That is our base defense. We do a lot of other things out of this defense.

LOAD 53

The next defense we look at is the over 53 look. Our call-side end is in a 9 technique, and the backside end is in a 5 technique.

OVER 53

Between the load and over calls, only two players changed their techniques. The only two people to change are the call-side end and the Sam linebacker. The end steps out to a 9 technique, and the Sam linebacker steps inside. If we call 
load, 
the call-side end knows he is in the 7 technique. If we call 
over, 
the end is in a 9 technique.

We are a one-gap defense up front. The tackles are going to work together. The tackles know that if we are in load, the offside tackle is responsible for the B gap and the backside tackle is responsible for the A
