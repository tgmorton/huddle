Let's go on to the zone play. The next big read he is going to get is the counter off tackle. This was a big read for us this year. The tight end would step up and get our end into a drive block. He would punch to the inside. As he was doing that, the offensive tackle was taking a zone step to get outside of our end so he could reach him. That is a tough block for the tackle, especially if the end is a player. We want our end to explode and make a straight line up the field. We want to attack the end as he releases. We do not want him to release to get to our Sam linebacker. We try to hold him up from going inside. If we can do that, it will take the tackle and end to block our end. Our Sam linebacker can make the play on a scrape to the outside. Also, our Mike linebacker is scraping to that side. The zone play may go five yards outside. If we can make the play go back inside, we are happy. If the play stretches outside, the C gap also stretches. The same is true for the B and A gaps as they stretch. Everyone has to get into their gaps and stretch the play. As the play cuts back, the pursuit will make the play.

7 TECHNIQUE VS. OUTSIDE ZONE

The next thing I want to talk about is playing the draw and screen plays. Every day we talk to our ends about these plays. If that offensive tackle gives our end a high hat and the tackle tries to punch him upfield and opens his hips, he knows something is wrong. We need to learn how to play the draw. As the end comes off the ball, most tackles are going to hunch back and try to knock the end upfield. I tell the end that he has to stop in his tracks. If he sees the tackle and sees the draw, he has to retrace his steps and come back down inside and make the play. If our end does get upfield and then he sees the draw, we want him to retrace his steps straight back down the field. If he can do that, he probably will make the tackle at the line of scrimmage, or the play may bounce outside. Next, I want to talk about what I call all of the unusual plays that the defensive end is going to see from a 7 technique. This is something you have to put into your practices and work on. We work on the screen with our 5 and 7 technique. If the tackle tries to chop us as we get upfield and the quarterback continues to give ground, then something is going on. The end has to develop some instincts. If he feels that the screen is developing, he must get downfield. We want to plant and move our eyes to the outside. We are looking for a receiver coming back down inside. He may be able to break the play up if he can get there in time, or he may be able to make the tackle as soon as the receiver catches the ball.

We work on the draw and screen every day. We take a football and have them in their positions. We simulate the quarterback on a drop. If the quarterback drops the ball down, we have them step and plant the inside foot and open back to the inside. He retraces his steps, looking back inside. We want him in position to make the play. If the quarterback drops deeper, the defender should know it is a screen. One of the first plays we are going to check for is the screen. If the outside screen is not there, we look for the middle screen. We work this drill every day. In the course of the game, when they run the screens, you have to be able to react to them. Because we have covered what to do, we feel we have a chance to be successful.

Next, I want to talk about the pass rush. The thing we want to do is to key the football and movement. We are in a three-point stance. When we are in the pass rush mode, we want to close our base stance. We use more of a sprinter's stance. We tell him to get into the most comfortable stance. We want him to be able to rush upfield. We want him to be able to rush the quarterback. We want our rush people to know the down and distance on each play. We want them to attack half the man as they get upfield. We always want to have a game play. I tell our players that we have a first move and then we have a countermove. I am going to go over three types of pass rush. I want to cover the rip, swim, and spin techniques.

The first technique I will cover is the speed rush. It is 3rd and 10, and we have to get to the quarterback. I
