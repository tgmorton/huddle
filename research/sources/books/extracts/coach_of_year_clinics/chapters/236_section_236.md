THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTSTRONG

The other thing you must understand is that the offense will attack you two ways. They will attack you horizontally or, as Al Davis says, vertically. When you are thinking about zone coverages, those are the only two words you should think about. When you watch your opponent, you ask this question: Are they attacking us horizontally or vertically? In the old days, when Al Davis was coaching the Raiders, he did not have a horizontal pattern in his play book. He was verticalboom! If you watch the West Coast offense, it is all horizontal. Three deep and four short is a good defense for the vertical patterns. However, it is tough when they attack you horizontally.

Next is our three deep, four short-weak. Now we are going to take the zone, and we are going to roll it to the weak side. We are going to put that corner in that weak flat. We bring the free safety over to play the outside one third. The strong safety comes over to the middle, and the strong corner drops back to play the outside one third. We drop the strong backer and the two inside linebackers.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTWEAK

You can disguise these looks. That is a whole can of worms in itself. They have three down linemen, they have four linebackers, and they are in three-deep coverage. That is one hell of a defense from an eightman front. That defense came into being with Monte Kiffin and the eagle defense when he was at Nebraska and Arkansas. What they did was to slide the line. Now, the strong safety who played the strong flat before is going to come back and take the deep middle. The corner who played the outside one third is going to play the flat area.

THREE DEEP, FOUR SHORTWEAK

You can see that the free safety will play the outside one third on the weak side, and the corner to the field is going to play that outside one third. That is a weak zone.

In the strong zone, before, we had no way to harass the wide receiver. Now, with this coverage we are going to harass the wideout. We could not do that in the strong coverage. Now we are going to dictate what pattern they are going to run. Before, they have been hurting us by dragging their tight end, hooking or curling the X end, or putting the back out into the flat, when we were in our conventional strong three-deep. That would be a horizontal pattern. At the time, they do not have a pattern. The minute we harass the split end and cover the flat, we have three over two.

That is the other thing you must understand about pass defense. It is either three over two or two over
