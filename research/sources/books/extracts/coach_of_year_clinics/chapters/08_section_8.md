cleared him for spring practice the day before we started. I really wanted to see whether he was going to play as if he had a broken arm or whether he would play like a football player. He played as if he wanted to be a football player. He was the most productive man I had in the secondary this season. I called him the "Trash Man." He scored three or four times on interception, fumbles, and blocked kicks. He was always there to pick the ball up and get in the end zone. He had tremendous vision. I remember visiting with the Dolphins' line coach when he was giving a lecture at Clemson. I asked him what he thought was the most important thing about a defensive player. He said 
vision. 
A lot of people talk about a linebacker having a nose for the ball. He doesn't have a nose for the ballhe has great vision. I got to thinking about it. I had never been around a great defensive player who didn't have good vision. An intangible that a player may have can allow him to be productive if he is strong enough at being dependable. We tell our guys that there is no place for excuses. George Washington Carver made the statement that 99 percent of the failures come from people who have learned the habit of making excuses. That is a strong statement, but it is true. We don't want excuses. We want results.

Attitude is 
a thing that can make a difference. Attitude controls how far you go. It controls you performance, preparation, and success. You have to have 
discipline. 
The problem we have is that the kids we get don't have a whole lot of self-discipline. They have to lean on us as coaches. We have to discipline them until they can do it for themselves. That is a difficult thing for most people. The last quality we look for is 
persistence. 
If you are lucky enough to get those three qualities in a person, he is going to be hard to beat, regardless of his speed or size. If you have enough people with those qualities, you are going to be hard to be beat. We are going to try to continue to do things in the off-season to coach those things. Any day we don't scrimmage, we end up on the goal line. Every one of those things comes out on the goal line. We tell our guys, "People don't score on you unless you let them." Every time we scrimmage in situations, we go 3rd and 3 and 4th and 1. Every time someone gets in our end zone, our defense runs a gasser after practice. It is not punishment, because all of them can do that without any effort. It is a matter of 
pride. 
That is the goal-line attitude you are trying to develop.

We have some defensive goals. We want to be the best defense there is in the state, conference, and nation. We have our objectives posted in our locker room, and each player gets a copy of them. This year we ranked number one in rushing, passing, and scoring defense in the state of Florida. In the conference we ranked number one in rushing, but we were number two in the other categories. In the nation we were number one in rushing defense. We were number six in passing defense. We gave up 229 total yards and 11 points a game. This is important for us and our kids to see.

We spend every penny we can to get better as coaches. We travel to other college programs and pro camps to study defenses and schemes. But that doesn't mean we are going to be better coaches next year. Maybe it can prevent us from going out there and doing some things that could prevent our kids from being the best they can be. Every time we recruit a defensive back, I ask him how good he wants to be. If he tells me he wants to be great, I'll try my best to make sure he gets there. Deion told me after his sophomore year that he wanted to be an All American and the best defensive back in America. I told him, all right, I was going to start coaching him like that. I didn't want him to start bitching and moaning at me when I was down his throat and pushing him. If you are a star, you will not be coached gently. When you tell them that and they tell you to do whatever it takes, an agreement has been reached. If they mean what they tell you, they will take the toughest coaching you can give them.

Our base defense is a 4-3. Ours is a little different from most 4-3 defenses. We play our defensive end about a yard wider than most defensive ends. We put them in a three-point stance and cock them in toward the inside. We tell them to get into the backfield as quickly as they can. We had one kid that ran 4.7 in the 40 but played like he ran 4.5. The other kid ran 4.5 and played like a 4.5. They weren't quite as big as most defensive ends. One was very athletic and skilled. The other was a hard-nosed country boy. One of them was a doctor's son, and the other was the son of a blue-collar worker.
