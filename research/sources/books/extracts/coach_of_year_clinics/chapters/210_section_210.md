practice. We try to simulate game situations with what we are doing in these drills. The first 10 minutes of practice is just that; it is warm-up. When they come to me for drill work, they have to be ready to go. Some backs are notorious for wanting to stretch through half of practice. Some of them want to go through group work at half speed. Then when it comes time for team work, all of a sudden they are ready for practice. Our backs know when we go to drills, we are thinking of playing football. We are not thinking of it as continuing to warm up for team work. That may be an attitude problem that you may want to work on with your running backs.

Next we run a drill that we call react and cut. We get the same bags and stand them up. We have a manager holding those bags. We have a line of players behind the dummies with a ball. I will put a cone at the side of the bag and one down the field about 10 yards. We have the players come smoothly to the bag. They press that point of attack. Then the manager leans one bag one way or the other. The player shuffles away from the bag and accelerates through the hole. We do not want him to shuffle too wide.

This drill is working a little on our inside zone running play. On that play, we tell the back this: Smooth to the hole, press the point of attack. If he has an onside crease that he knows he can get to and make a big play, then he is to accelerate through the onside crease. If there is no onside crease, then he must think about taking the ball to the back side. It is imperative on the inside zone play that the back comes to the hole smoothly. They cannot be coming so fast that they cannot cut the play back to the back side. They must operate in a smooth fashion coming to the hole. What we are doing in the drill is forcing the back to find the backside crease. He has to find the hole, and then he has to accelerate through the hole. This drill ties in very well with our inside running game. We do not want them to come to the line of scrimmage and stutter-step. He finds the hole and works on acceleration.

We have one other drill that we do. We do not do this drill every day, but we make sure that we work on it a couple of times a week. We line up four cones in a straight line less than a yard apart. The back takes the ball in his right hand and starts toward the dummy. He shuffles through the first three cones. Then he sprints to the next cone and spins around the next cone. He puts the ball in the other hand. Then he accelerates to the next cone. We have a manager there with a hand dummy. He slams the back with the hand dummy. What we are doing is trying to make sure that we get every inch we can along that sideline.

Nothing bothers me more than to see a running back drift out of bounds when contact is made. We want to make sure that we get every inch we can on each play. We are working on the shuffle step, we are working on putting the hand down, we are working on switching the ball and accelerating, and we are working on getting every inch we can on the sideline. If you will notice, we are trying to combine two or more techniques into the drill.
