reason we went to that particular spot was because that is where Herman Moore was catching all of his passes. He would line up at different spots, but he would still end up at that spot. That is where we had to get in order to stop the pass.

The next zone is what everyone is using now. It is our two deep, five short-hard. We are going to play the two corners hard. The word after the underneath coverage tells the corners how to play. Hard means they are going to play hard on the run, play collision on the wide receiver, and play that area. If we are in a 50 defense, this is how it looks.

TWO DEEP, FIVE SHORTHARD

We keep the two safeties deep, and they set in the middle of the field, with each man responsible for one half of the field. It is a two-deep with five short, and we are playing hard. Why are we getting tricky? Because we have the horizontal game shut off. We have five short defenders underneath. They should not be able to complete anything in the 10- to 12-yard areas. We are going to collision the two wideouts. This will make them alter their pattern. Now the dilemma comes. What is open? What is open? The vertical game. Now they are going to attack the area between the two safeties. Also, they will attack the areas to the deep outside. I call the area to the outside the side pocket. Have you ever played pool? That is where they want to put the pass. How are they going to get it there? They are going to get it there two ways. They can have the wide receivers release inside and then come back on a corner route. The other way is to come straight out, make the corner miss on the collision, and then get down to the pocket for the fade route. Those are about the only two ways they can get deep against you.

What are we going to do in the secondary when we are in this defense? We have to work the heck out of defending those patterns. We have to work hard to get a good collision on the two wideouts. We have to be able to collision and still get back on the corner. The safeties have to be ready to break on the ball.

The other route we face is the tight end coming down the middle. The linebacker has to get a piece of that tight end as he comes downfield. That is easy to do if it is a drop-back pass. If it is play action, it is a problem for the linebacker. We can change it up as far as who and how we drop our linebackers. This is the way the offense is going to attack the two-deep, five-short, hard defense. They are going to try to get three-deep receivers on your two-deep defenders. On the back side, we have three defenders on their one receiver. On the front side, we have four on their two receivers. I know that there are a lot of one-back sets today. I do not have time to go over that, but this is the basic way we play that zone.

On the 4-3 look, we have three linebackers in the game. Now we have two deep, five shortsoft.

TWO DEEP, FIVE SHORTSOFT
