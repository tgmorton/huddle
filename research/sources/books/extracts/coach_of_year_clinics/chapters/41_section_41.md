and players, but the fans. But the program really wasn't. My chief concern was how to keep the momentum going. That was the theme I brought to the coaching staff. If you are trying to turn a losing program around, your real problems come the second year, after having some success the first year.

That first year when you take over as a coach, everyone really buys into what you are preaching. You sell the team and that the team is the most important thing. In the second year, I believe that human nature takes over, and the team starts to get more individualistic. Some guys began to think that ''the team is winning, but I'm not playing." Those selfish attitudes can crop up and start to wear on a team. Going into the 1996 season, I studied a lot of second-year programs. I got a lot of media guides of all the major colleges through the years. I looked at the coaching changes. I looked at the first year where they had some success, but the second year was worse than the first. I was really concerned about that.

I think that there is a psychology about being involved in a second-year program. I want to share some of my staff agenda with you. I'm not going to cover all of it, but there are some highlights. I think these things are critical to our program. The first thing on the agenda is a senior barbecue. I'll come back to this a little later, because I think there is so much to be said about senior leadership, how you lead them, and how you teach them to lead. The first year that I was head coach at LSU, I found myself constantly talking about leadership. While you are traveling, you have a lot of time to think. I wondered how much these kids knew about leadership. I assumed that someone had taught them how to be a leader. You can't do that.

I have a player council. I started this when I was at Vanderbilt. I have two players from each class. I have the classes vote for them privately; I'm not there when they vote. I meet with the council periodically. Sometimes I take them to breakfast, and sometimes we meet in my office. They have a voice, but they don't have authority. They don't tell me who to play, what to run, or how to run the team. They are going to tell me things that the head coach would have no way of knowing. I have no idea what it is like being a student at LSU. I have no way of knowing what is served at the bars or how many drugs are around. I make a decision to learn about it or not to learn about it.

Every other week we meet as a council. I always go with an agenda. There are certain things I want to know about, so I ask them. They tell me. After that I turn the floor over to them. They have come up with some good things. If you let them talk, they will make your program better. I always ask our strength coach who the five best and five worst players are in the weight room. I like to go into camp knowing who has had a good summer and who has had a bad one. As it worked out, the five best in August in weights had outstanding years for us. Of the five worst, one left the team before camp, one didn't finish the season, one I threw off the team, and two didn't play at all. I was alerted before the season started that these guys weren't going to come into camp and all of a sudden have great work ethics.

After we go through personnel as a staff, we go to organization. I think it is tremendously important that you go through organization with your coaches. I think you have an obligation to them to discuss it. I'm going into my seventh year as a head coach. I've got five guys on my staff who have been with me for those seven years. There are certain things that shouldn't take the amount of time that it took seven years ago. I come from the Michigan school, because I was with Coach Bill McCartney for nine years. If you didn't get there at 4:30 in the morning and leave at midnight, you were a lousy coach. There is something to seeing how you are using your time. It is something for a new staff member, his wife, and his family not to be surprised by how much he is going to work or how little he is going to work. I think you owe that to your staff. I've always reviewed with them our work week and our work format.

I schedule situation scrimmages, such as goal line, short yardage, our pass protection, and other problems we are having. I took the things that hurt us the most during the season in 1995 as the guidelines for the situation scrimmages. We were very average in short yardage, goal line, throwing the ball when we had pressure on us, and the two-minute drill. Rather than get into a big philosophical discussion with the
