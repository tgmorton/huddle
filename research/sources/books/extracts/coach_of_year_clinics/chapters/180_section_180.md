Let me show you our cover one. I'll draw this up as an eight-man front. The corners in our defense would be in bump-and-run man on the two wide receivers. The strong safety and three linebackers are responsible for the backs and tight end. The free safety plays over the top in this coverage. The Will linebacker has the split-end side break, and the strong safety has the tight-end side break. Break means "if the formation splits someone else out." If the tailback aligns in the slot to the split-end side, the Will linebacker is responsible for him. That is only for the backs. The corners have the wide receivers all the time.

If the offense brings both wide receivers to the same side, we bring both of our corners over to that side. You may do it differently, but whoever starts out on the tight end has tight-end side breaks, and the Will linebacker always has split-end side breaks. That means we will never have a Will linebacker cover a wide receiver. These two formations are the only ones they can make with normal personnel in the game.

If one of the backs goes in motion to the split end, the Will linebacker covers him. If one of them goes in motion to the tight-end side, the strong safety has him.

Let me get into the techniques of coverage. The divider for the corner is 1 yard on top of the numbers, or 10 yards from the sideline. If I teach a corner to play bump and run, the first thing I want to do is make sure he understands the divider principle. If the receiver is inside the divider, the corner is aligned outside and on his low shoulder. If the receiver is outside the divider, the corner aligns inside and plays high-shoulder position. The receiver wants to get on top because he can go anywhere he wants from that position. We take that away from him. We get on top and cut him off. If the receiver is inside the divider, the corner will be outside and on the low shoulder. If the receiver runs a flag route outside the divider, the corner can easily get to the high shoulder and cut him off.

In the bump and run, the corner should off-hand jam the receiver. If the receiver aligns right on the divider, the corner aligns outside and low. The corner watches the hips of the receiver. As long as the hips are square, the corner is square. As soon as he starts to turn his hips one way or the other, the corners off-hand jams him. If the break is to the inside, the corner jams with his outside hand. If the break is outside, the corner jams with his inside hand. We try to hit between the receiver's shoulder tips and near tip.

Bump and run is the best coverage you can play against anybody, even with marginal athletes. You have a better chance playing guys up on receivers than you do off. The hardest thing to do in man coverage is to play off a receiver and cover him. It is the hardest thing to teach. The corner has to have great feet, be able to redirect, and have a great burst to the ball. Plus, the receiver knows whether he is going, and you don't. When you get up and bump, you are in position to cover the guy, as long as you stay in position and get your hands on the receiver.

Most guys make the mistake of widening their feet and setting back when the receiver breaks. As soon as a defensive back gets in that position, he is beat. To get out of that position, the defensive back has to step back inside his frame to be able to go anywhere. What the back wants to do is keep his feet together, so that when the receiver starts his move, the back can slide
