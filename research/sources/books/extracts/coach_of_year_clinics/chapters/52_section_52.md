The quarterback reads the strong side first. He reads the defender over number 2. We run the slant or seam routes. What happens is that everyone will show you cover three and then rotate to cover two. You have four men going vertical, and the defense is stacked back there against you. This route was put in to use against teams that like to play cover two against four vertical. The second routes were routes that we like to run against teams that rushed the passer. That is where we like to run the double-in routes.

This route is used because we can't run four vertical because the defense is going to cover two. We are going to run the two men on the outside and make it look like they are going vertical. What did I say a minute ago about teams that play cover two now as compared to in past years? That is right. They are sinking back. If they are sinking back, we want to throw the ball in front of them. We are going to make them think we are running four vertical. It is OK if the two inside get in collisions. If the man on him collides with him, it will open up the throwing lane outside.

This is how our quarterback looks at the play. He gets his pre-snap read. It looks like the defense is going to be in cover two. He wants to see which defender has the best chance on the inside jam. We would prefer that we not get the collision on the inside men. We would like to stick the ball in deep if the safety is backing up. If the inside is covered, we look at the defender's shoulders. We look at the defender's shoulders and read him. If he jams the inside receiver, we throw the ball to the outside man on the 2 route. If he does not jam the man, we stick the ball to him. It is a 7- to 8-yard route. Sometimes they run for days on this route. This is one of the best evolutions of the three-step passing game. The reason is this: Before, we only had two or three routes we could run from the three-step drop passing game. Before, we could run the quick out, hitch, and slant routes. That was about it. Now we have two more plays that we can run here. The 292 pass is a great route for us. We can run the 166 play as well.

I am going to coach you up. See if you are with me. We are in a three-deep situation. We may try to go four vertical or throw the hitch to the outside. If the defense is in a two-deep, we are going to run some type of double-in or the 292 seam. The whole point is that we have all three of these routes that we can run at the quarterback's command.

I am going to coach you up on the next situation. We call, "Flex right, check draw, slant or quick pass." The quarterback comes up to the line, and it has a three-deep look. It is a balanced front. We are going to go 181. If we come up and the defense has everyone walked off and has a balanced front, we are going to run the stretch play to the tight end side. If they have everyone walked off, an unbalanced front, and the linebacker walked outside, we run the draw play strong. This is not hard. It is not a matter of me having the chalk. Those are three things we could do to run or pass the ball.

Now we come up, and the corners are playing off the wide receivers, and they are playing cover two. We do not want to run a desperate route; we will just run 292. It sounds good, doesn't it? It would sound a lot better if you could win some games with it. Do you understand? We have been used to doing this. We just have to get it across to our players. We got a lot better at moving the ball. The point is that you have to have a system in place.

In the early 1970s, I was coaching at the University of North Carolina. Part of my learning process as a coach was to go watch Dean Smith practice basketball. Ijust sat in the stands and watched him coach. Everyone in the building was 100 percent behind the system. It did not matter if it was Michael Jordan, a sub on the team, a manager, or whateverthey were 100 percent behind the system. There was not any doubt about it. They believed in it. To be a player or an assistant coach involved in part of the change of command, you have to believe in your leader and make sure you back him up to the hilt. When Dean Smith blew the whistle, everything stopped. When players were supposed to be some place, they were there. Sure Dean Smith recruits, but he coaches their butts off, men. He even coaches them when they get out of school. In all of the time he has been there, he has only had two players who did not graduate from college. 
Two
