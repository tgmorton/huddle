The first person we tell the end to look for is the pulling lineman coming down the line. If the offensive lineman is off the line, it will probably be some kind of bootleg or waggle play. If he sees that, he heads upfield to try to contain the quarterback. If the man is pulling down the line, we want our end to occupy the hole and squeeze the play down. We want to attack the inside shoulder of the blocker and push him back upfield. This will allow our Will linebacker to scrape over the top and make the stop. If our defensive end does not get under the pulling guard, we have trouble.

DOWN BLOCK/KICK-OUT/COUNTER

That allows the tackle to get down on the Mike linebacker. They have a chance to get the play away. Will is going to scrape off outside. The Mike linebacker is filling inside and plays the football.

The next play that the 5 technique looks for is the bootleg reverse. If the fullback does not have the ball, he looks for the reverse. We ask our end to keep his shoulders square to the goalpost. We want him to make a straight line and get up the field. We do not want him to try to get outside. We want him to go straight upfield. We want to make the football bounce wide. We want to make the football bounce deeper and wider. Hopefully, we will have some help, and they will make the play. We want to make the ball bounce deep and wide and let our pursuit catch the ball. If we can do that, we will be in good shape.

Those are the reads we do every day in practice for the 5 technique. This is the bread and butter of playing defensive end. We do not switch our ends. We keep them on the same side. We play the techniques the same.

5 TECHNIQUEBOOTLEG REVERSE

The next thing I want to talk about is our 7 technique. I feel that we play the 7 technique pretty well. Again, the inside hand is down, and the outside foot is back. He lines up on the inside neck of the tight end. Everything we talk about starts with that first step. The tight end comes off to drive-block the 7 technique. We do the same things that we did against the offensive tackle when we were in the 5 technique. We want to step up and use our hands to get inside the V of his neck and drive him back up the field. We do key inside. Some teams key the offensive tackle. We feel that the tight end will tell us what is going on. There are only three or four things he can do. He can reach inside to try to cut us off, he can drive-block us, he can release outside on a pass route, and he can sit back and block for some type of play like the draw. If our end can understand the progression and know what is coming off, he will be in good shape.

Again, it is the same as the 5 technique against the tackle on the drive block. We want to step up, punch, get our hands inside, and lock the tight end out. We want to find out what is going on with the ball. If the football is inside, we want to close off the C gap. He is a C-gap player.
