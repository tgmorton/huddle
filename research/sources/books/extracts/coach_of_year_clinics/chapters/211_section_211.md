Another drill we call the jump drill. Most great backs have quick feet. They are not plodders. You do not hear them coming. They put the foot down, and they are gone. We put four bags down. We lay the bags in a Z-like design. The runner faces the first bag. He jumps over the first bag with both feet together. He keeps his shoulders parallel to the line of scrimmage. He jumps over the next bag sideways. We want him to go over the bags with light feet if possible. Then he jumps the next bag, again keeping the shoulders square. He jumps over the last bag and then accelerates through the cones.

At the end of the drill, we have two players with pushback dummies at the cones. The back comes off the last dummy, accelerates, and tries to split the two players with the dummies. They jam the runner to give him some resistance. He will lower his shoulder, split those two dummies, and then accelerate. We always finish the drill off with some kind of acceleration.

I want to show you the drills on tape. [Video]

In the off-season, we do a lot of jumping rope. We do a lot of rope skipping where we are moving. We do not do a lot of static rope jumping. We are working on getting our feet up and down as quickly as possible. We do not want the feet coming up high. We want really quick feet. We jump with two feet and then jump back across the line with one foot. We work on quick feet movement. Then we jump or skip sideways. First, we do one foot, then we do two feet sideways. Then we do both feet backwards.

Next I want to get to what we are doing in terms of contact drills and blocking drills. Our philosophy is no different from most others. If our back can make the defense miss him and he can run for a touchdown each time, that is great. But you and I know that is not the way football is. If you can make them miss and you can put it in the end zone, then do it. If you get pinned in with one man, we want to use the lift drill. If we are pinned on the sideline and we do not have the opportunity to cut back, we know that we are going to make contact with the defender, and we are going to look him up.

When we see that contact is obvious, we are going to look him up. We are going to turn back into the man. We are going to go look him up. We drop our arm and our fist as if we were going to plant it into the ground. We want to get our shoulder pad under the defensive man's shoulder pads. As we come into contact, we want to turn our hips in to the man. As contact is made, we want to come up with our elbow in tight and a really hard punching action with our upper body. We try to lift through the man and try to get yards after contact.

We keep a chart called "after-contact yards." We score them with a plus or a double plus. If our back makes contact with the defender and he gets 4 1/2 yards, we give him a plus YAC. The YAC is yards after contact. If he gets 7 or more yards, we give him a double-plus YAC. If he only gets 1 or 2 YAC, that is only average. We expect more. If he gets no yardage, he gets a minus. Our backs set a goal going into each game of how many YACs and how many double YACs they want to get in a game. They are thinking about breaking tackles. They are thinking about yards after contact.

To simulate the drill, we will put another running back down on all fours. The back with the ball will be 3 to 4 yards from him. On the sound of "hut," the defender comes up to simulate a tackler. The back turns and gets into the tackler. He makes slight contact and brings the fist up into punching action. He wants to work through the lift. I do not want to get underneath the man and punch up, I want to punch through. Punching through and at the right angle is where you are going to get the YAC. In the spring we do this drill every day. In the season we do it through Wednesday, making sure that they get at least one lift with each arm. The key is to get into the middle of the defender
