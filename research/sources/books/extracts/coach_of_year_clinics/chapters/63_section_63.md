practice causing turnovers every single, solitary day. For the last three years we have been fourth, seventh, and third in turnover ratio in the nation. That gives you a chance to play football and be successful. The number one objective of the offensive team is, "Do not turn the ball over." If that is the number one objective on offense, then the number one objective on defense should be, "Make them turn the ball over." That is what we are going to try to do. We had a board with 31 defensive objectives on it. We had things like "Stop teams 20 percent of the time inside the 20-yard line." You had to figure what yard line it was and use a calculator, and by that time they were snapping the ball. We couldn't keep up with all our objectives.

I told the coaches, "No more objectives." My assistants said, "We have to have defensive objectives." I said, "Okay, we're going to have five." Here they are. (1) Execute the defense called in the huddle. That took the place of four of the previous objectives on that board. (2) Be physical. The defense doesn't have to worry about assignments, so be physical. (3) Sell out every play. That means give 110 percent on every play. I shouldn't say this and don't take this wrong. We've got players, and then we've got eaters and crappers. We put 60 guys on an airplane to go play. You have about 40 that play their butts off. You have 20 guys standing around giggling and farting. They eat like hell; they eat everything. You just have a lot of eaters and crappers around. You need to get rid of them and get some players. We are going to have a bunch of guys play for us. But you can bet that if they don't bust their butts when the ball is snapped, they're not going to play for us. (4) No gifts. Make the offense earn everything they get. It is hard to take the ball and move it for a long period of time. (5) Tackle. That is what defense is all about.

We have some guys who are not very smart around our place. It starts with me. I'm probably the dumbest guy, but I can remember those five objectives. We quiz our players on these all the time. They better know them.

The thing we want to do is match up well. If you have a great back, we are going to make you throw the football. If we play a team that has a great receiver, we will do everything in our power to take him out of the game. We want to make the offense do something out of the ordinary to beat us. We don't let you do what you have always done. This is how we set up our defense. I hope this is not boring you to tears; at the same time, I hope it is not too elementary. This is the best I have ever seen.

We are going to base our defense off the numbers defense. There are eight gaps, and we have gap responsibility. We have gap control and will have a guy in each one of those gaps. We tell our tackles that we are going to call 1, 2, or 3. That tells them where to line up. We have a strong and weak side to the defense. The first number is the strong-side tackle or tight-end side, and the second number is the weak-side tackle or split-end side. A 31 defensive alignment puts the strong-side tackle in a 3 technique, and he has B gap responsibility. The backside tackle, in a 1 technique, has A gap responsibility. The Mike linebacker plays to the strong side and has the strong-side A or B gap. The Will linebacker plays to the weak side and has A or B gap. In the 31 defense, since the strong tackle has the B gap, the Mike linebacker has A gap. On the weak side the weak tackle has A gap, so the Will linebacker has the B gap. That is how we start the defense and where the tackles and inside linebackers line up.

On the outside we do four things. We play regular, solid, hammer, and wide. If we play a regular alignment, the defensive end lines up in a 7 technique. If we call a "33," that is a regular defense for us.
