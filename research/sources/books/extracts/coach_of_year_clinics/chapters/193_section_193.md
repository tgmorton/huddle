and catches the ball before he runs with it. This gives the read and blocks a chance to develop. We can run this from two tight ends and be in a situation where we can run it both ways. The 6-2 defense will be a leverage-type defense. The defense is aligned in 1, 5, and 9 techniques to both sides of the ball. One of the toughest things about running this play in short-yardage situations is that the defense can get more people to the ball than you can block. This is a play where you can give the ball to a great back and give him a chance. There is a leverage player in the 5 and 9 technique. Defenses like to pinch in short yardage. This is a great play against that stunt. The closer you get to the goal line, the tighter the defense gets. This play is a great play on the 1-yard line. Especially if you can run a little inside zone play to the fullback or the quarterback sneak.

The play that helped our short-yardage offense is the quarterback sneak. When you can run that play, the defense has to tighten up inside. That lets you run the sweep on the goal line. The guard's rule doesn't change. He pulls for the support. If they play bump and run on the goal line, we tell the wide receivers to outside-release and run to the back of the end line.

If they play a zone, the wide receiver has to block the corner. The center hard-scoops the strong A gap. The fullback aims at the inside leg of the tackle. He lets the guard clear and tracks the inside linebacker. The backside is in a full scoop. That includes the second tight end. The tailback has the same read as he did on the previous defense. He reads the 9 technique.

We are blessed with outstanding athletes at Florida State. We take our plays and break down their averages. We know what they average in short yardage as well as the open field. The toss sweep averaged between 6.5 and 8 yards a carry. That is a play you can hang your hat on. This is a play that we will establish.

The next play is the sprint draw. This play averages between 6.5 and 8 yards a carry. Let's start with the eight-man front. The tight end's rule is to release on the outside support when the tackle is uncovered, unless he gets a 4-3 call. The tight tackle blocks the defensive end. The tight guard blocks the 3, 2, or 1 technique. The techniques they are going to use will look like the sprint-draw pass. They are going to show their pads. They try to lift the defensive men out of their shoes and short-step them off the ball. That is the same technique we use in our sprint-draw protection.

The center and split guard combination block the defensive tackle and backside linebacker. The center squares his hips, knocks the tackle over to the guard, and gets off on the inside linebacker.

We want the defensive linemen to think 
pass. 
The split tackle pass-sets, engages the defensive 5 technique, and tries to run him upfield. If we can get them rushing upfield, this is a great play. The split end releases for the rover. If the rover is on the line, he goes up on the free safety. We can establish the sprint-draw pass, and it makes this play really go.

Let's draw it up against the leverage defense. The defense is in a 9, 5, and 1 technique to the tight side. They are 3 and 5 technique to the split side. The tight end and tackle have the same blocking technique. He shows his pads to the defensive end, engages him, and runs him up the field. If the defensive end sets on the line, the tight end short-steps out, engages him, and drives him off the ball. The tight tackle shows his pads, engages the defensive tackle, and works him upfield.
