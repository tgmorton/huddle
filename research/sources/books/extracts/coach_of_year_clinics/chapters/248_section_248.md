around them. We make them chase one another in the warm-up drills. We use these circles and incorporate them into our sack-and-strip drill.

We have dummies with Velcro arms on them. We normally put a ball in them. As the linebackers are speed-rushing, they take the inside, upfield shoulder and wrap up the tackle. The downfield arm is stripping the ball. If they get the ball stripped out, they are scooping and scoring with the ball. If. the numbers of our players to theirs are even, we want to scoop and score. If the numbers are in their favor, get on the ball and recover it. We are working on a half-moon speed rush: knocking the ball out, scooping, and scoring. We try to pick the ball up and get it in the center of our body. We don't want them to try to pick the ball up outside the frame of the body. They straddle the ball when they pick it up. Then we have a race to the end zone. Make sure you spike it at the end. That is simple stuff, but they have to work on it too.

To teach the linebacker how to play over a tight end, I put him in a fit position. I put him in a position where his hands are on the inside and the tight end's hands are outside. I start with their arms collapsed. That is to simulate the tight end firing off and engulfing the linebacker. The linebacker's eyes are at the tight end's throat. His hands are inside, and his thumbs are up. He wants his feet in a good power base. From this point right here, I have to teach them to separate and shed. We call the drill "fit, separate, and shed." From this point, I work on extending his arms, getting his hips back, and getting his head to the outside. If the tight end starts to walk on the linebacker, the linebacker keeps a firm arm in the direction he is going. He takes three steps with the tight end and violently sheds him. From there, he gets in position to tackle.

The next thing we do is to put the tight end's hands down and let him come off. The linebacker has to fight for the inside hand position, get his hips and body away, and power-clean the tight end. Then he repeats the first drill.

I have added to the drill because we got a new tight-end coach who is working as hard as I am with his tight ends. I had to develop another part to this drill to work on beating the tight end's hands. I put two guys on a line. They are going for a three-second count. One guy starts with his hands inside. When I say go, the other guy tries to get his hands inside. They are pushing against each other and regaining inside control. We work on base, short steps, and control. If one guy loses his base, the other tries to throw him off the line.

We work on shedding a guy down. If a tight end is walking on us and has good body lean, we have trouble shedding him with the rip or throwing him to the side. The only way to get off a tight end who has stood up the linebacker and is walking on him is to give ground and shed him down. We also incorporate that in the fit-and-shed drill.

When we talk about pass rush, it takes a lot of off-season work. We work with a karate expert. It helps keep the hands of the offensive linemen off us. If a guy is trying to get his hands on the linebacker, we want the linebacker to strike and clean the offense's hands, elbow to wrist. Long-armed tackles are what we face. We make the contact on them elbow to wrist. You have to learn how to practice against each other. We don't want to hurt our guys. We try not to have any bull rushes. We put them 3 yards away from each other as a running back on a linebacker. We work edges and finish with rips and swims.

If we reach the level of the quarterback, we want to be a contain rusher. At the same time, if we can beat the guy inside to the quarterback, we do. The first time we blitz, I want the linebacker to bull-rush over the back.

"Time is up!"

Fellows, this always happens to me, whether it is Coach Fisher cutting my individual period or the moderator telling me to stop. It's been great being here.
