It is an inside counterdive, and it may be run from a split-backs or I formation. The log is made by the backside guard. He pulls around the block of the frontside guard. We do run the reverse-out dive option. We fake the dive option and hand back to the tailback. We can run it on the goal line. The offside guard comes off on the linebacker. It is a good play. I think it is a better play against the 4-3 defense. The center blocks back on the tackle, and we put the guard off the center's tails, straight up the field.

The play we like down on the goal line is our G block. We get a double-team block with the tackle and tight end. It is a great short yardage or goal-line play. The lead back and running back read the guard's block on the defensive end. We have a double team at the point of attack. We pull the onside guard and trap the end. If the end comes down, we log-block him. If he goes outside, we trap him out.

46 G VS. 50 DEFENSE

As I said, I liked what Terry Bowden did with the toss sweep. This is how we started blocking it, and it has been a good play for us. Now, we lead the fullback through on the linebacker and pull the guard. It is our power sweep to the tight end. Again, the fullback blocks the linebacker to the side of the play. The guard pulls and blocks the force man. The tailback steps at the line of scrimmage on his first step. He may run the play anywhere inside or outside, depending on what the end does. We are scooping really hard on the back side.

48 POWER SWEEP VS. 50 DEFENSE

As I said, we do throw the football. We run our combo pass protection for our one-step and three-step passing games. We do not release our running backs on this play. We pack it inside. We want to protect the quarterback. Teams are using the blitz more today. We do lock on man, or big on big. The backs block the first man to show outside of our tackle's block. If we get against a team that runs a slant-and-loop tackle, then we will have to keep our tight end in and let him block the second man outside. Our running back can't block both of them. That is our quick-step passing game.

COMBO PROTECTION

We were a sprint-out team this year because we had an outstanding quarterback who could run, and he could throw on the run. We changed our sprint protection this year. We decided that we would have our linemen take a short step inside and block the area. We used to turn inside, but we were getting too much penetration. We decided to step inside and keep our shoulders square.

We never take a man. We can't take care of the blitzes if we take a man. The backs take the first and second men outside of the play-side tackle.
