that we are dealing with young and, most of the time, inexperienced players. I create the package with blocking schemes on it. I take the plays in the huddle. We try to put as much info on the sheets as we possibly can. Again, we are dealing with young players.

Our defensive coordinator creates his index cards to match these plays included in the package. We have them numbered so they correspond. We have the play number, description of the play, the defense we will use, and special notes on who to watch. He has the list prepared and gives it to me. I start down through the list, running the plays. Occasionally, our defense will not do well on, say, play number 6. He will come back to me and say, "In two plays, run play 6 again." We want to make sure that the defense knows what they are doing.

We play a 50 defense. It is very easy to put in the blocking schemes for the scout team. Our goal is to put as much information on these as possible. I have discovered in dealing with the Rudys that I get a better job if I put the blocking schemes on my play sheets. We want to be as effective as possible. We want to accomplish four things. (1) We do not want to waste time in the huddle. (2) We do not want the first team waiting on the Rudys. (3) We do not break the huddle until the first team is ready. (4) If we wait at the line of scrimmage for longer than 10 seconds, we huddle again. We want to communicate as quickly as possible.

We do some things on the scout-team plays to help communicate with the players. If we pull a man, we draw the path for the pulling man in red. Now there is no excuse for the guard not to know he is pulling. For the ball carrier, we indicate with a heavy black circle and a heavy black line the path he is to run. We try to give our quarterback some key information on the fake or action he will employ. For us, a blue line indicates a pass or pitch. Now, remember, this is not ours; it is our opponent's offense.

We line up the backs to indicate their alignment. I do not have to say anything in the huddle. I just hold up the sheet and then ask if there are any questions. If no questions, we can run the play. We make sure to give the direction that the quarterback comes out. We give the location of the slots and flankers. We make note of any fakes. Also, we indicate where the quarterback would call the snap count on motion plays. If we draw a receiver with a straight line and nothing at the end of the line, he is to run the corner or defender off. If the line has a line forming a T, he blocks. If a pass play is called and the man is covered, we still want the quarterback to throw the ball. Remember, the practice is for the defense, not for the offense. We have to explain that to the quarterbacks.

If we want to run an audible, we can. If we find that the defense is loading up on us, we can call the audible and run the dump pass to the tight end. We would call our live color, call "red 33" on the line, and run the pass play.

We have found that most teams run 60 percent of the same plays each year. We do not have to draw these plays up each year. We just use the same plays the next year.

We try to duplicate everything you do. We try to duplicate the huddle you use. If you are in two lines facing the line of scrimmage or if you huddle in a circle, we do that. The more I ask of the Rudys, the better they perform. They do not execute at 100 percent all of the time, but they try hard.

If you walk or run to the line of scrimmage, we try to duplicate that. We duplicate your line splits. If the linemen come up to the line of scrimmage and get down, we do the same. If they wait for the quarterback to call "down," we will give the same look. We can't always do it, but we try to duplicate the quarterback's cadence. If you like to run an audible in certain situations, we try to do it too. The big thing that this does is to allow us to be able to call a snap count on something other than one. Again, we are trying to make it as realistic as possible. You must remember that the attention span of the Rudys is not too long.

When the scout team goes to defense, our offensive guards make a call on every play. There are four calls for the guards. They are covered, uncovered, inside gap,
