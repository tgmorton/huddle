days are Tuesday and Wednesday, and we go seven on nine during those days. We spend 16 minutes with seven on offense against nine defensive players. We bring our safeties into the drill. We go best on best, full speed. Everything is full speed, except you don't tackle the ball carrier. You butt the hell out of him, but you don't put him on the ground. That makes us a physical team. We are going to stop the run and run the football.

Our defensive back and wide receiver work against each other every day. We work best on best in a manto-man scheme. We work that way for at least two periods every day. That makes us better offensively and defensively. We had Shawn Springs on one side and Ty Howard on the other. They played man to man, which allowed the safeties to crowd the line of scrimmage and run the alleys. We played a nine-man front almost all year long.

There are some things you need in your offense. You have to have power inside and speed on the perimeter. You also have to have some finesse, because there are some teams on your schedule that you are not going to be able to just run north and south on. You need some draws, counters, and screens. I'm also going to add an option next year. We are going to run more option because of the styles of defense we are facing. We are facing a lot of man coverage, with the safeties running the alley. They are playing five under and two deep. We are going to mix more option in our offense to control what the defense is doing.

When we are on offense, we are in charge. We know the snap count. We are going to get out of the huddle, sprint to the line, and go. But we are also going to have a freeze call to draw the defense offside. We want to control the tempo of the game. We will give you a lot of different sets. We want the defense to have to think. If the defense is thinking, they are less aggressive and will make mistakes. We run basic plays from a lot of different sets and formations.

We use three types of blocking schemes. We use a man, gap, and zone scheme. The man scheme is exactly W`hat it says. The gap is a double-down and kick-out type of scheme. And the zone scheme is exactly what it says. We work on the board with our best on best, just like the seven on nine. We want to take advantage of our best players. We have had some great offensive linemen at Ohio State. The best one we've ever had was Orlando Pace. He is 6' 7", weighs 330 pounds, runs a 4.9 forty, benches 500 pounds, and goes bear hunting with a switch. He is a 
footballplayer. 
The first day he walked on campus, he was our starting left tackle. We played 13 true freshmen last year and started two. Our middle linebacker was a freshman. He will probably be the next great linebacker to come out of Ohio State. We had a freshman wide receiver who caught 13 passes against Indiana and two touchdown passes in the Rose Bowl game. We are not afraid to play freshmen. We don't guarantee freshmen that they will play. We tell them the best players play. If a freshman comes in and is better than an upperclassman, he plays. In your game plan you should take advantage of your best players, attack the defense with personnel and alignment, and make them defend the entire field.

Our backs read the defense pre-snap. They know whether they are going to cut back or stay straight ahead. We try to predetermine before the ball is snapped whether to cut it back or bounce out. When we are using our gap scheme, which is our doubledown and kick-out scheme, we want to run downhill toward the line of scrimmage. We do an awful lot of "check with me" calls at the line of scrimmage. We call a run or pass depending on what the defense is doing. We count the people in the box. If you have six in the box, we run the ball. If you have seven in the box, we throw the ball. We can run the play both ways with the "check with me" call. In the huddle we call "24-25 check with me.'' When we come to the line of scrimmage, the quarterback decides which side to run. We use our quick-passing game in the "check with me" scheme.

We use movement to try to create mismatches with personnel. We want to be flexible. We run from a lot of different personnel groupings. We are going to run in all situations. Going in, coming out, long yardage, and short yardage are situations where we are going to run the ball. That sets up our play-action passes. We think we are a great play-action-passing team. In the Rose Bowl, we lined up in two tight ends and one flanker.
