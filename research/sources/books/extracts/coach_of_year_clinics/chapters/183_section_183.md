The hardest pattern to cover is the double cross by the tight end and slot back. The first thing you do when you get cut off from the receiver who you are covering is to look through the guy who cut you to see whether anything is coming. If there is, it is an automatic cut to the other guy back. That is the first thing. Guys won't do that sometimes. As soon as they get cut off their man, they want to fade back into the hole. What this ends up looking like is a soft zone about 5 to 7 yards deep. When the linebacker gets the cut call, he looks through the guy who cut him and picks up the pattern coming the other way. That way, they don't have to change directions but once.

This coverage will play well in nickel coverage. It plays an eight-man front in the nickel. It will play against four wideouts. It will play against three wideouts and a tight end. In every situation, it makes a front with one more man than the offense has. If you play against four wideouts, you have six in the box and can play the coverage. If they have a tight end, three wideouts, and one back in the game, you have seven guys in the box, and the offense has six to block you. All you need is two guys to play corner. That is why the corners in the NFL always make more money than safeties.

We teach all our coverages the same way. If we play zone, we play cover three and six. When we teach three-deep zone, we teach relationships. We have a flat player who relates to number 1. We have a hook player who relates to number 2 weak. We have a hook player strong who relates to number 3. We have a flat player strong who relates to number 2. We have a corner-corner-free safety in the three-deep coverage. Our weak-side rotation is cover six. Our strong-side rotation is cover three. We teach the drops to everyone.

The progression in zone for us is to drop, reroute a receiver, match the pattern after the pattern distribution, and break on the ball. Matching the pattern after the pattern distribution is another talk. We number the receivers from the outside in on both sides. The flanker strong would be 1, tight end 2, and the back to that side would be 3. The split end weak would be 1, and the running back to that side would be 2. The flanker does a curl, the tight end hooks, and the strong back runs a flat. After the pattern distribution, the back is 1, flanker 2, and tight end 3. This coverage is like man to man, except you don't have a man. If a receiver comes into your zone, he is your man. That is pattern matching. This is good because you don't get picked off.

Fellows I really enjoyed being here. Come to see us any time you get the chance. You guys really do a great job of coaching. Keep it up. Thanks.
