Off this play we had the fullback belly, which was a power play straight at the defense. Then we put the option play in off the belly play. We felt that we could get into formations and have an advantage blocking. We would not have to block the 5 technique. Then we do it one step beyond by adding a reverse play off the option as a misdirection play. It is a simple game that we feel gave us an advantage with leverage blocking.

That is how we attack the defense. We are going to have a power play that comes at you. We are going to have an option play off the power play. Then we have the play-action pass off the option play. It is a very simple scheme. This is especially true for our offensive line, where we want to keep it as simple as we can. We were able to run a power, option, reverse, and play action; get in the shotgun formation; and do the same thing. But the thing our offensive coaches did was to create leverage both inside and outside for our linemen. That is a big advantage, as anyone knows.

I appreciate the opportunity to be here. Come to see us practice. Again, thank you.
