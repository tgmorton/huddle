certain that what you are asking for you are getting. That is your responsibility to your program, school, and the players. You are dealing with a collective group, but you are dealing with them one at a time.

Locker room, training rooms, and offices are areas where there should be a certain decorum. There is a certain demeanor that the players should assume. We do not want the training room to be a place where players just hang out. Coaches need to pass through the training room to see how things are going. "How is that ingrown hair on your butt doing, Mortimer? Is it getting better? Hey, you can't afford to miss any more practice, pal. You need to get out there and go to work."

When players come to your office, they need to feel that the door is open to them. It needs to be a place that is warm and receptive, but it comes time when you must take care of business. "What can I do for you?" Get the problem out on the table, and then get him out of there. It should not be a place where they lounge around.

Locker room settings can be interesting places. They can become sociological pockets. One thing that we did when I was at San Francisco with Coach Walsh was to go through the locker rooms, both pre- and postpractice, to see how things were going. Every once in a while, you have this little pocket of players that may be planning a coup d'état with your squad. You need to walk right in the middle of that and spoil t. There can't be any sanctuary for the players. They need to know that you are every place. They need to know that you are interested in how they are doing. "Is everything going OK up on campus?" They need to see you as someone other than a policeman of their rights and wrongs on the football field. I think it is important for the coach to pass through the locker room, not only to police the area, but to take a look to see what is going on. Some of you may be surprised at what goes on in some locker rooms. There may be a cure for AIDS in some of these lockers. If you do not get by and take a look at them once in a while, the players will think you do not care and will not make an effort to keep the place neat. Now, do not misunderstand-we do not have standby inspections. But players notice if you come around or if you care how things look. We need to take a look to see how things are going. If you don't, they start to think you do not care. That will start to reflect on the attitude of your team that you do not want to have. How they behave in the training room, how they treat the training-room people and equipment people, how they treat one another, and how they treat the facilities you have are important. Ours need improving, and I am sure most of yours do too. But what you have is what you have. Until it gets improved, it is the best that you have, and their attitude is reflected in how the players take care of it.

It is important for the coach to be present in all areas of the program. They need to understand that there is a modus operandi in the locker room, training room, meeting room, offices, and on the field. This is all part of capturing that concentration. It is all part of building the finish to the football team.

There is always danger in rumors and innuendos. You can defuse a lot of that by being present. You can learn a lot by taking 15 minutes to walk through the locker room after practice. "How did it go today, Mortimer? Are the towels soft enough? How is the soap?" When you get around in the locker room and visit with them, they know you care.

Football is a family affair. A lot of things that go on with a football team are confidential. We have guys, and they have them in pro football, that will call home with a problem. "He called me an SOB in practice." Now, we do not want to do that, and it may happen, but you would like to keep some things as confidential as possible. You do that by talking to them in this manner. "This is a manly sport, and we interchange on a manly level. We want to keep things within the family setting." Meetings are very important, and that is why we have them. We do not want to call meetings just to be meeting. We want to keep them short, concise, and to the point. We do not want to waste their time, and we do not want them to waste our time. If we have a meeting, we have something to tell them. When we are through with the meeting, we want to break. We always want to finish the meeting with a special flare. You may think this is corny; we think it is important.
