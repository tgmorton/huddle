Linebacker Drills And Techniques

Houston Oilers

I appreciate the opportunity to get a chance to visit with you. I want to make this as informative as I can. I want to make this as fun as I can. I understand that it is a poor meeting when I'm doing all the talking. I feel that same way when I am involved with the players. A meeting has to be an extension of the field. I don't play anymore. They do. They play the games on Sunday, Saturday afternoons, and Friday nights. They have to know as much about what you do so that they are better able to play the game.

One of the most complimentary things that can be said about me is, "You still think like a high school coach." That is still said about me when I get into the personnel meetings on whether a guy can play or not. Right now we are going through all that with the college draft.

If the kid makes plays at the high school level, he'll make plays at the college level, if given a chance to play. If the guy is a play maker at the college level, he will make plays at our level, too. It will happen that way because play makers are play makers. Some of the best football coaches I have every coached with to this day were the high school coaches that I played for, the high school coaches on my staff, and the coaches that are still there in Kansas City.

It was easier for me to get on with the Houston Oilers than it was for me to become a head football coach in the state of Texas. I do think that there are some great high school football coaches in Texas. Some of the worst coaches I've been associated with are at the pro level. There are some weak coaches in pro ball. There are some baby-sitters here. They think the guys can go ahead, line up, and play. All they have to do is keep them out of trouble and make sure his car gets washed. It doesn't happen that way. These guys still have to be coached. They crave to be coached. We are going to coach them from when they get out of the Lexus until they get back into to it at the end of the day. That s the kind of staff Jeff Fisher has put together. Before I get long and drawn out with a lot of things dealing with linebacker play, I'm going to hit this really quick. I'm going to talk about philosophy. I would much rather be sitting where you are than doing this. That is what I have missed for the last 10 years since I've been at this level. I miss the clinics, fellowship, and the interchange of ideas. Understand, at the pro level we don't tell anybody crap. We don't tell each other anything, because that is taking food out of my kid's mouth. The guys that will get me fired are the guys at the Chargers, Lions, and Cowboys. We are not telling anybody anything. When I sat out there, I used to hate all that philosophical bullcrap. I will be brief with this.

I do believe this. If you are a young football coach, the most important thing in coaching is your philosophy, not your scheme. It is more about changing the behavior of that young man than it is about that scheme. I do believe it is important. That is why I'm going to talk a little about this to start with. After that, I'll get into some drills. I've got a film at the end that I'll show. After you watch that film, you're going to say, "He ain't any better than me." I am you. I have coached junior high, high school, college, and pro football. The reason I'm still at this level is because I'm going to coach the players every single day as hard as I can coach them.

I had a guy say to me, "You need to understand: I'm an individual. You need to treat me as an individual." He needed to understand to do it our way. We had to give him more than one way to be successful. But if he thought about being an individual, he needed to go to an individual sport. This is a team sport.

Let's talk really quickly about linebackers. I've done this at every level I've been at. As soon as the game is over, I come in and turn the film on. I ask myself two questions. The first question is, "Am I coaching that specific technique?" I ask that question especially if there was a bad play or something negative that
