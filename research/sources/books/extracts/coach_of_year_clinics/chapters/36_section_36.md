Step five is this. As you throw the football, you bring the ball up to the top of the circle, bring the opposite arm down to break the plane of the back, and transfer the weight. As you bring the off arm down, your index finger is the last finger off the football. That should put your palm out of the way. If I throw the football, my palm should rotate inside and point away from my body. If the palm is turning over to the side where you can see the palm, you are sidearming the ball. That means you are turning your wrist. I promise you, if the index finger is the last finger off the ball, you will not break your wrist. As you come over the top of that circle, it is a perfect overhand throw.

We need to talk about a couple of side points here. Let me review the five major points of throwing a football: trigger position, top of the circle, transferring the weight, elbow breaking the plane of the back, palm turned away with the index finger off the ball.

Now consider a couple of other points. We emphasize this to our quarterbacks: ''We do not want you to patty-cake the football." A lot of quarterbacks pattycake the ball as they are holding it. I see them on TV. They patty-cake from the throwing hand to the offside hand-back and forth. Do you know what you are telling the defense when you patty-cake the football? Here it comes! If you do that against a good defensive secondary, they will pick you to death. You do not pat the football! If I see my quarterback pat the ball, he has to run a 40-yard sprint.

When you are standing up and have the football in the trigger position, it is a short release. Have you ever heard a coach talk about shortening the release of a quarterback? If the football is in the trigger position and you come to the top of the circle, you are shortening the release. One thing I take pride in with our quarterbacks is that they have a short release. They are not going to separate and have a big windup. One of the best releases in football is by Dan Marino.

I videotape all of our quarterbacks on their release. I tape other quarterbacks in college and the NFL as well. I am fascinated with the release of the football. I have the kids sit down and look at their release. I show the quarterbacks on the video in slow motion. Some of my players think they are movie stars. I go over the release with each of them, and then I tell them what they need to work on.

Question: What drills do you use to help with the release? We have a couple of drills that we use that I want to discuss with you. We have a drill that we call the rope drill. [Demo] We have the player bring the ball to the top of his circle and have him stop at that point. We take a rope and tie it over his wrist and have another player hold the rope. We make the quarterback throw the ball over the top of the rope. We want them to pretend the rope is not there. Some kids get obsessed with that rope. We tell them not to worry about it. We want them to throw through the rope. It is not going to hurt anyone. We have taken care of sidearm quarterbacks with this drill. We get some kids who want to come under the rope on their release. The rope drill will help them get the ball to the top of the circle. I have seen other coaches who use a volleyball net to force the quarterback to release the ball over. Some coaches use a goal post for the drill. I use the rope because you get 100 feet of rope for two or three bucks. You can have them work on it in the offseason. This is especially good for your young kids. I love working with those young kids. They will listen to you. They are all eyes. If you can get them going in peewee football, you can teach them good habits.

We put the players in a circle and have them throw the ball over the rope to each other. [Demo] This is a coaching clinic, so we are going to correct the demonstrators. We want the throwing motion to be natural. What we do at our quarterback camp is to tape every kid when he first comes in. I see all kinds of techniques. Then I show them at the end of the camp, so they can see the progress they have made.

Next drill-we need two quarterbacks here and two over on the other side. Now we do the kneel-down drill. We start with one knee up. Everything is going to be the same. The ball is between the earlobe and the armpit. We still stress all of the points in the release. He still has the circle, he still releases, he brings the left or nonthrowing arm down, and he comes off with the index finger last. They play pitch and catch with each other. Next we go to two knees. It is the same
