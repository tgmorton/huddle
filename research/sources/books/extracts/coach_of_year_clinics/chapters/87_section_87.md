The next drill I use is a repetition drill, working on schemes. I line up the guys across the field with offense on one side and defense on the other. I stand behind the defense and give them commands. I tell them they have their left arm free. They take two steps, getting the pad under pad. I check each of them as they go. It is rapid fire. In the course of five minutes I can get through base, reach, and cutoff blocks.

After that I work on low blocks. I work on everything that might happen to them in a game. Then we go to stunts. I tell them they have their left arm free, slant right. I coach the offense to do certain things to the defense. I tell them to scoop on their steps and watch the reaction of the defense. Then I line them up and we pass-rush. So in 5 to 10 minutes, I can get in all the situations that they see in a game.

This drill goes along with the bend drill. I put them on the line. They have to sprint upfield, bend around the cone, and dive on the dummy. I time this to see how fast they can get it done. There is nothing wrong with diving. They come around the horn and dive in on the dummy. That forces them to angle in.

When we play the low block, I want the eyes of the defensive linemen down on the blocker. What they want to do is hit them on the back. That is being lazy and not wanting to bend their knees. I want the hands in front of them, keeping him away from their feet. If the defensive guy is focused on the ball carrier, he'll get cut. If the blocker goes down, the defender goes down with him.

We don't see the double-team block much any more. The block we are seeing is the chip off to the linebacker. If the defender drops to the ground on a chip block, that is what the offense wants him to do. We stay on our feet until we feel pressure coming.

We don't break down when we tackle. If we break down on a good back, it won't make any difference. We probably aren't going to make the tackle anyway. I tell them to go get them. If we miss, make them readjust their movement. We are going to attack everyone. The only thing different is that the second guy in strips the ball. Our approach is to attack and go make it happen.

Let me show you the three fronts we run. This first one is the reduced front weak side. We shade the noseguard to the weak side. The ends are in a 5 and a 7 technique. The tackle plays a 3 technique to the tight-end side. We play with the Will linebacker to the weak side, the Mike linebacker in the middle, and the Buck linebacker to the tight-end side.

Our best run defense was what we called ''tight.'' We played the nose in a strong shade to the tight end. The tackle played a 2 technique to the split-end side. Our strong-side defensive end was in a 4 technique, and the weak-side was in a 5 technique. The Will linebacker played on the tight end. The Mike linebacker played a 3 technique strong. The Buck linebacker played a 2 stack to the weak side. The tackle slanted
