linebackers make the proper drops. If the quarterback is running a 5-step drop, the defensive linemen can run a delayed stunt. Teach down and distance and pass drops in your philosophy.

If the offensive goes to two tight ends versus the 4-3 defense, most coverages are some kind of quarter coverage. Generally, we are in quarters all the way across. The corner has the wide receiver mostly in man coverage in the zone. If the receiver runs past 10 yards, the corner has him man to man. If the receiver climbs to 14 yards, he still is man. After that he is going to trade him to the safety. If he takes off, he lets him go. He is then reading flow and could be support on a run.

In the 4-3 defense versus a two-tight-end set, we will declare to the side we think you are going to run. That means we will play a 36 technique to the strong side and a 27 to the weak side. We declare our strong-side tackle to a 3 technique, which is outside eye of the guard, and the end in a 6 technique, which is head-up the tight end.

To the other side we play the tackle in a 2 technique, which is head-up the guard, and a 7 technique, which is inside eye of the other tight end. In the 4-3 defense there are a lot of holes or bubbles in the alignment. The inside tackles have to be studs. They have to be able to draw the double team. If the offense can handle your tackle with one guy, your defense is going to be weak. The tackles have to make the belly play bounce flat to the line and outside. For this type of offense to be successful, there have to be tight ends who like to block. In the 4-3 defense the safeties have to stay on top of the number-two receiver, who is the tight end.

The two-tight-end formation is a good formation to run against a 4-3 defense, if you have two good tight ends. The offense can make all kinds of adjustments with their personnel and cause the defense some problems with alignment. I like the 4-3 defense because it allows you at all times to run "run blitzes." That gives you the chance to get minus yards in pass situations or definite run situations. The 2nd and 2 is a waste down for the offense. The 3rd and 2 play is a run situation for the first down. These are situations where we like a "run blitz."

A lot of defensive coordinators would like to find one key that will put them in the right front. I'm going to give you some ideas about how to find those keys. When you scout a football team, find out from each formation what play they like to run. We like to run the "tight 5." That puts us in an overshift defense to the tight end. This gives us a 1 and a 5 technique to the split-end side. We are in a 3 and a 9 technique to the tight-end side. We move and jump or stem into those sets. The offense likes to come to the line and call their play. You want to get into a defense and then stem to the "tight 5."

If the offense comes out with a back strong, we can take the Sam linebacker, walk him up on the line outside the defensive end, and bring him. The defensive end takes an inside charge and covers the Sam linebacker's gap and the Sam linebacker takes the defensive end's responsibility. If the offense sets a back weak, the Will linebacker and 5-technique end can do the same thing.
