Now I am going to talk about offensive line play. We had a big team last year. Our starting left tackle was 6' 4'', 260; the left guard was 6' 2", 290; the center was 6' 2", 255; the right guard was 6' 2", 255; the right tackle was 6' 0", 300; and the tight end was 6' 1", 215. Our backup tackles were 6' 0", 285, and 6' 4", 325. The thing I was proud of was the fact that we had kids with good grades. We are not a school where the teachers just give you grades. You have to work hard at our school. We had some bright kids, and that helped a lot.

I am going to talk about our offensive line. We use the four-point stance on offense for our guards and tackles. We get our rear end up in the air, and we bow our necks, so we can see the defender in front of us or at least see his hands. We have our weight forward. We do not teach backup blocking, and we do not trap a lot. We stress four points in our stance. It is balanced and squared, toe-and-heel stagger, hands under the shoulders, hips higher than the head, eyes up. We want our weight forward. Explode with the lead step (no crossover), short first step, let your weight go, roll the hips. Tackles: inside foot back, head in the hole. Our center's stance is the same stance as the other linemen. He is down in a squat. Extend the ball out, free hand on the ground; explode as you snap; lift ball (snatch); charge over ball; roll off the balls of the feet; lead step, short first step.

Now I am going to get to some X's and O's. When I was here two years ago and listened to Terry Bowden lecture, I liked what he did on the sweep play. It became a good play for us. I want to tell you what we do and why we do it. We play against Cincinnati Princeton High School. They are the best team in our league. Pat Mancuso just retired at Princeton. They were very predictable in their defense. They ran a 50 slant defense. We know that if we get them on the hash mark, they are going to slant a certain way. We run our 33 or 32 dive with fold blocking. It is a hard dive at the covered lineman. Here it is with the nose on the center.

33 DIVE VS. 50
