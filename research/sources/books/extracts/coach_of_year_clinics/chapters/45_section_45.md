game captain in Tiger Stadium. I recognized that was another motivating tool, so I went along with that idea.

Always evaluate senior leadership on specific criteria. I started to develop a small questionnaire to evaluate leadership. Is the kid a starter? Is he well liked? Does he practice well? How did he report to camp? Did he pass the conditioning test? I think he should have a personal record on his conditioning test. Why wouldn't a senior in his last year with a chance to play for his last SEC championship have a personal record? The 1997 season will be a challenge if most of our seniors who are coming back and going to play come back in worse condition than when they were juniors. I have a problem if that happens. I better address that right away.

Let me cover these thoughts quickly before I run out of time: (1) Always play someone if you promised to. At Colorado, one of our coaches promised a kid that he would play in the game regardless of what the score was. We said he was going to play, and we didn't play him. (2) Always be yourself. (3) Always teach team. (4) Try to be the most physical team. (5) Work on blocking and tackling. (6) Be able to run the football. (7) Practice situations. (8) Always videotape practices and games.

The last thing I have is "always script practice." Thursday was the toughest day for me as offensive coordinator when I was at Colorado. That was the short practice. I couldn't practice every situation. I made up a form that has every possible situation. It has 100 plays on it. It has everything that could possibly happen to you during the course of a gameor for a season, for that matter. Most of the plays didn't have to be rehearsed on Thursday. All it did was to organize my thinking. That is so that if I need a certain situation to go over on Thursday, I have it. The other type of script was the game rehearsal we had before the first game. It had a kickoff after a safety and overtime games. We used that every preseason, right before the opening game.

I believe that when we play flat, that is my fault. I take that responsibility. I hold the offensive coordinator responsible for the offense and the defensive coordinator responsible for the defense. I hold myself responsible for the emotion and motivation of our team.

On Sunday I meet with the team and review their play in the game. I meet with each unit and tell them what they did badly first and what they did well second. I meet with the offense, defense, and kicking team. I know everything that is going on. I just met with their coaches, and they told me what was going on. Having the presence of the head coach and the knowledge gives them confidence.

Monday is an off day for us. Tuesday is our scouting-report day. We try to be as honest as we can. We don't run guys down who our people will be playing against. We don't overrate the team. This is a motivating atmosphere. We are trying to get our people ready to play.

On Wednesday I meet with them as a team. We come together after practice, and I'll say something to them. On Thursday I have a prepractice meeting to go over the practice plan. There is no screwing around on Thursday. We are not a loosey-goosey outfit. We want no one who is not going to play grab-assing around. You can have as much fun as you want on Tuesday or Wednesday, but Thursday is a very serious day. After practice I meet with the team without any assistants there. It is strictly motivation about the game. On Friday we are very unemotional and technical. I want every coach to go through the game plan. I want it to be really focused, with absolutely no screwing around. I didn't let two kids play this year because they were a minute late. We won both games. Saturday is game day. We generally play at night. I get my last chance at the team in the cafeteria before we eat the pregame meal.

Gentlemen, I got about half way through, but I have to catch a flight. I enjoyed saying hello to some of you guys who came by. I wish I could stick around. It was great being here, and I hope everyone has a great season. Thanks.
