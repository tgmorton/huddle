Let me show you the weak-side sprint draw. It is a combination hardball play and a pass set. The number situation against the eight-man front doesn't look good, but we've had a lot of success with this play. We get a "rover call." That identifies the defense for us. The rover call puts the fullback on the rover. The center knows that on a rover call he works with the split guard to push the 2 technique up into the playside linebacker.

The tight guard and tackle do not scoop. The tight tackle tries to get his hip square on the 3 technique. The tight guard chips up on the backside linebacker. The tight end cuts off the 7 technique. The unblocked man is the strong safety. The tailback is looking to run on the outside leg of the split guard. It has the potential on a heavy 5 technique to break outside. On the back side, we are trying to get square, not cut off. We want to have the ability to cut back to these blocks. The tight end takes an inside zone step and squares his pads on the 7 technique. He tries to push that man upfield because the ball could break back to him.

Against the leverage defense to the strong side, this is an outstanding play. The tight end and tackle short-step, square their hips, and work the defensive tackle and end back downfield. The tight guard and center combination-block the 1 technique back into the Sam linebacker. The split guard and tackle short-step and work their men back. The fullback runs through the A or B gap to block the Mike linebacker. The tailback has a different look from the eight-man front. There is a natural alley outside the 5 technique. He wants to get out there if he can. If the 5 technique plays too heavily on the tackle, the tailback takes the outside alley. I've seen the play break back in to a little home-run alley created by the overplay of the Sam linebacker. If we get the noseguard blocked, that is a great alley.

Quickly, let me put up the 4-3 defense. It is blocked like the strong-side play. We hardball with the split guard and center into the Mike linebacker. The tight guard and tackle do the same thing with the defensive tackle into the Sam linebacker. The fullback leads up on the Will linebacker. The tailback takes the play to the daylight. He has the natural alley outside the 5 technique on this defense also. The tight end shows his pads and runs the defensive end past the ball.

The next personnel grouping we work into is the three-wide receiver group. It is a strong passing formation. We take a 250-pound tight end out of the game and replace him with another fast receiver. Now, you can really penetrate the field with three great speed guys. You can get vertical and run curl-flats and flood routes. It also gives you the ability to run the football on the defense. The defense has to make a decision. The defense has to take one of their linebackers from the inside and walk him out to try to disrupt one of those wide receivers. If you get a six-on-six in the box, you are in good shape. We try to run the isolation to both sides.

Our third wide receiver blocks the walked-off linebacker. The tight tackle short-steps his defensive tackle. The tight guard and the center work a hardball combination on the noseguard to the backside linebacker. The split guard and tackle short-set the 3 and 5 techniques. The fullback isolates the first inside
