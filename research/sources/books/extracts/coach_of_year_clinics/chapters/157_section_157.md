push. Finally, they will get it. Here we go. Feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, jump. Boom! Now you can snatch. It takes about that long to teach them. If we ever get messed up, we go back to our clues.

After three or four weeks of hang-cleaning and hang-snatching, we tell them to go off the floor. We never snatch off the floor. We just clean off the floor. That is how we teach clean and snatch.

Here is an example of a work week. Our warm-up is footwork, core work, pre-hab, and loosening up. Then we go to our workout.

On Monday it is a speed day. We are going to do plyometrics and jumps, but not a lot. We are not going to jump off anything high. We usually set some hurdles up and jump over them. We have a jump floor built in the middle of the weight room. We got this from a flooring company back in Baltimore. We just jump over hurdles that are to one side on the jump floor. We set some cones up and jump with one leg over to the other side. All this is special strength. That is all it is. We are just jumping over some little things.

As they get more confident, we play games. Last week, we had five hurdles set up that they had to jump over. After the last hurdle, we had a box that they had to jump up on or jump over. We had a 350-pound offensive tackle who was not able to jump up on the box. We started teasing him, telling him it was the "box of death" and that he could not do it. He got mad and proved that he could do it. As he got more confidence, he proved that he could do it. It was a fun thing. It was at the end of training. It was jump hurdles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and jump on the box. That was at the end of our training.

Back to Monday: plyometrics, wave squats. What are wave squats? We take a load of about 25 percent of what we can squat, and we are going to put it on our shoulders. We are going to do 2 plus 4 plus 2 with it. It may be 1 plus 5 plus 1. It may be 3 plus 6 plus 3. It is something along that pattern. We are going to put the bar on our shoulders, and we are going to squat. The bar is on our shoulders and we are going to squat, 1,2. Next we are going to do four quarter squats with power. The coaching point is this. I want to see a violent change from one direction to the other. It is from down to up. We are not doing squat jumps. I have 30 players in the weight room. I can't watch 30 guys doing squat jumps. If I were coaching one long-jumper, yes, but not 30 football players in the weight room. We are going to do our quarter squats: bam, bam, bam bam. We want an explosive change of direction, down to up. What is the key when you are doing the vertical jump? It is being able to get from the down position to the up position and get up in the air. What is the key when you are changing direction on the field? How quickly you can get from one point to the other. You want to create separation on offense and close separation on defense.

We are doing 2 plus 4 plus 2. It is with a light load. We use 20 to 30 percent. We use the hang in the 20 to 25 percent region. When they first start, they will have trouble with their balance. You have to teach them to sit up, just as you do in a jerk.

On Monday we go out and do our speed skill drills. We will work up to where we are doing some fast sprints. They are 20- to 50-yard sprints. Also, we do bench presses; that lasts about one-half hour. All of the coaches want everyone to bench-press 400 pounds. If a kicker can't bench 400 pounds, he can't kick a field goal! Everyone has to bench-press 400 pounds before they leave. This is not going to do them any good unless they get knocked down and they have to get up really quickly. You do not have to bench 400 pounds to be a good football player, because that is not how the game is played. I have worked with a number of players who have gone on to the NFL who could not bench-press 400 pounds. Most of them were just average on the bench press. Now, they all could clean well over 300 pounds, squat 500 to 600 pounds, and move and change directions. The key to the game is butt, back, hip, and legs. That is our Monday workout.

Tuesday is a power day. We warm up, and then we do some cleans. We are going to do either hang or power cleans. We are going to do some jerks. What are jerks? It is the same movement as the quarter squat. Every
