If we get caught running a trap against the doubleeagle front, we have to block back with our center and guard and trap with the other guard. We do not like to run the play against this defense, but if we do have to run it, this is how we do it. If they shift into the defense and we get caught, we have to run the play.

VS. DOUBLE-EAGLE FRONT

When we run our trap, it is primarily a fullback play, but we do not always run it as a fullback play. We will run it as a one-back play. Say we are in the spread formation or shotgun formation. We can run it from the I back, the no-backs set, or motion no-backs.

I BACK IN A ONE-BACK SET

Next, I want to talk about our trap option. We run our trap option differently than most people. We have tried to incorporate our trap option into our outside zone package. Our outside zone package is this. If I am a tackle and I am covered and the guard is uncovered, I want to cross over and escape to the linebacker. The uncovered linemen will pull down and overtake. That is our basic scheme. If you are covered, you are going to stretch, cross over, and go upfield to the linebacker. If you are uncovered, you are going to pull and overtake. We try to incorporate our trap option with some outside zone concepts.

Our play starts out looking like a trap play. We option the end man on the line of scrimmage. This option generally gets the ball in the I back's hands. That is what we want because they are the best runners we have. Our quarterbacks are the next best runners. When we go to the open side, our option will get the ball in the quarterback's hands. However, this is the option to the tight-end side, where we are going to get the ball to the I back most of the time. Our tight end will try to get the outside linebacker on his side. The trap action will hold the linebackers, so the tight end has a good chance of getting the outside linebacker.

If we are running the option play to our right, the left tackle and left guard have to base the men on them. Oftentimes the left guard is uncovered, so he can work with the center. If the center is getting help from our left guard, then the center will rip-reach and escape, and the left guard will pull or overtake. The right guard knows that if the center is not working with him, he has to rip-reach on the man on him. If the defender is a wide 3 technique, the guard will usually cut the man on him. The right tackle will check for the outside linebacker plugging and then go to the middle linebacker. The tight end has the outside linebacker.

Against a 4-4 front, we see the linebacker more on the line. The backside guard and tackle base up. The fullback comes off the fake and tries to find the backside linebacker. The quarterback shows trap action and comes outside.
