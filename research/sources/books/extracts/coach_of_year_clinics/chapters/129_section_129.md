We use sequence football when possible. You only need four or five runs and three or four passes. When we are down inside the 15- to 10-yard line, we do not need a lot of offense. How many patterns do we need? We need something that will work against man coverage and something that will work against zone coverage. I am not saying that you cannot use dropback passing on the goal line, but we find that we have better success with play-action passes.

Effort and execution equal success! Our kids hear our coaches yelling out all of the time: "Think and execute; think and execute. Effort and execution; effort and execution." Those are vital concepts to our kids, and they understand the concept. They live with it, and they believe it. Our weekly goal-line package is simply a limited version of our base package. It allows for consistency. We are not going from one formation to another once we get on the goal line.

Let me talk about some advantages of our goal-line offense. Again, see if these advantages apply to your situation. You should write down what you think the advantages are for you and your goal-line offense. Here are the advantages of the split backs on the goal line. First is continuity. You stay with the same offense that got you there. Next is simplicity. It reduces the teaching time and techniques. When we teach our offense in August, there is very little we have to do after that. We do have to polish it up from time to time. The key is that we want our kids to be great technicians. In the last 11 years, we have continued to play until the last week of the season nine times. We have gone down the road as far as you could go in nine of those 11 years. Some of the drills we teach in August we are still doing the last week of the season as far as fundamentals are concerned. Be brilliant on the basics. Don't shortchange your kids there.

The third advantage of our offense is that it builds confidence. It can be done, and you can prove it with statistics. Develop your own statistics. If you are a varsity coach, don't have the varsity coaches keep track of the stats. If you do, they will make them say whatever they want them to say. Have a coach on the JV or frosh level take care of the stats. If you are a defensive coach, have a coach on offense keep the defensive stats, and vice versa. By doing it this way, the stats mean more to your team and can be helpful.

Next, I want to talk about some prerequisites for any goal-line offense. First, you can't stop yourself. What are you going to emphasize? What are your goals? The ideal goal is to score 100 percent of the time inside the 10-yard line. I do not know of any team that can do that, but it is the ideal goal. You might say that we want to score 70 percent of the time inside the 10-yard line. Then look to see if you are doing the things that will allow you to be successful.

We want to identify our bread-and-butter back and get him the football. Does that mean every down? No! If you are smart, it does not mean every first down. It may mean that you will fake the ball to that back and throw the play-action pass.

You must evaluate your statistics. Do you always run the ball on first down? The opponents have that figured out if you do. Give yourself an opportunity to be successful. Come up with the play-action pass on first down to throw them off balance. We take a look at our goal-line efficiency. We look at the situation and chart the number of times we are successful and the number of times we fail. If we scored a touchdown, we want to know why we were successful. If we had to settle for a field goal, we want to know why we did not score the touchdown. Did we do a poor job, did we make the right call, or did we get a penalty? We want to know why we were successful or why we failed.

Look at the reasons why you failed to score. Fumble! Was it a contact fumble or an exchange fumble? If it was because of contact, you will need to emphasize proper handling of the ball. You have to emphasize this to the ball carrier and motivate him to hold on to the football. If it was on the exchange, we want to know if it was caused by penetration, poor technique, or a missed assignment.

Another reason why we fail to score on the goal line is because of interceptions. Why did you throw? Was
