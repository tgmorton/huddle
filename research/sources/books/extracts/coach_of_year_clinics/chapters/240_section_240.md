quarterback does not know who is dropping to cover deep. When the receivers come out, we have people in the zones that they have not accounted for. That is why sometimes the quarterback will throw the ball right to a tackle. The quarterback sees the linebacker come and thinks that area is open. You can see the dilemma this has brought into play.

A few years ago this is what Penn State ran. They would bring their strong safety up close to the line and blitz him. They called him the hero.

HERO BLITZ

Teams would see the hero up tight, and they would check off and throw the quick route. Penn State would send the linebacker outside and pick off the pass. To me, this was the first zone blitz. It is amazing what you can do with this defense. This is something you can do in high school football. You can play three deep. Some of you may have been using this same type of defense. Remember the 10 commandments: personnelyour personnel! You may not have had the personnel to play man coverage. It does not have to be out of a 50 front. Carolina Panthers just so happened to be running that front. We watch a lot of tape. This is something that can help us. That is our zone blitz.

I am going to put the videotape on. I will point out the 10 commandments on defense. [Video]
