That can be a problem with quick or no-huddle teams. We run BASE and "G" 60 percent of the time. The other 40 percent we run different alignments with our tackles. We run something that will create some confusion.

The first one we go to is called "22 KNIFE." Knife is our slant technique.

It is something where we want to get the inside people moving. The 22 means that the nose and tackle are aligned in 2 techniques. Everyone knows when we go to head-up alignments, we are going to slant. But they don't know which way we are going. That is the confusion we want to create. The nose tackle and tackle are slanting back to the BASE defense. The tackle has the B gap strong, and the noseguard has the A gap weak.

In our knife technique we step laterally and fight to get their head in the crack of the gap. We call it "Hat in the Crack." That generates penetration off the slant. It can be good for you if your tackles have a good quick first step. They fight the inside arm, rip up trying to go low to high, and getting in the crack.

We can run the same stunt to the weak side. We call it "22 KNIFE WEAK." It is the reverse stunt from the strongside stunt. The difference is when the end hears a weak call he slants into the C gap. This is a good change-up for us. We create doubt in the offensive linemen's heads when we get in the head-up position. When the splits start to get tight, we know we are causing problems. We knife the short motion at times. The Mike linebacker calls the stunt on the field and we knife the motion. This is a great defense for teams with big splits in the offensive line.

I get excited talking about this next front because it has been real good for us. We call it "11." It is a wing-T stopper. It is an anti-trap front. The inside tackles have one thing in mind. We want them to get two yards of depth into the backfield. We are not seeing a lot of A gap football plays these days. What A gap plays there are is the quarterback sneak and trap. When we get in this defense they have to trap the 5 technique. The wing-T kicked our tails for two years. This defense stopped it.

The tackle and nose line up on the inside shoulders of the guard. When our linemen are playing inside techniques, they are ripping hard with their outside arm right through the ear hole of the guard. They are thinking penetration. The strong end plays a 7 technique. The Animal is in a 5 technique. The guy who loves this alignment the most is the Mike linebacker. The Sam linebacker is covered by the end so he has a chance to run a bit.

Here's how we played against the wing-T. The Mike linebacker takes care of the fullback. He is the midline player. The Mike linebacker spends the whole day tackling the fullback whether he has the ball or not. The Sam and Will linebackers key across unless they have a halfback in front of them. In this case the Will
