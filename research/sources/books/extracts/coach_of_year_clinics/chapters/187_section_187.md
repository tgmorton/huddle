I want his toes to be straight ahead. I may say, ''Feet!'' That means they are too wide or too narrow. I could say, "Stagger!" That means his stagger is too big or not big enough. If I say, "Tilt," that means their footwork will cause them to get reached.

We do something differently than a lot of people do. I have done this both ways. It doesn't matter what you call techniques, as long as your players know what you are talking about. We letter our gaps. The center-guard gap is the A gap. The guard-tackle gap is the B gap. The tackle-end gap is the C gap. Outside the tight end is the D gap. Head-up the guard would be B. If we want our lineman on the inside eye, that is a B minus. If we want him to straddle the inside leg, that is called tight B. The B plus is the outside eye of the guard. If we get into the B gap, that is called wide B.

We work hard on responsibility. I quiz my players on their assignments. You would be surprised at the number of kids who leave the huddle and don't know the defense or what the snap count is. They don't pay attention in the huddle.

Here is another thing we could talk about anytime. I'm not here to show you alignments, but we'll talk about them. They have to know the alignment, assignment, and reaction. Those things are more important. Never try to tell a kid that the defense will win a game. A scheme is only as good as the players playing it. Execution wins games. The front does not win games.

People ask us about flip-flopping people. We have done both at Penn State. If you don't flip your people, the guy playing on the right gets to play the trap the same way all the time. He uses the same steps and footwork all the time. But if you flip the guy playing the trap, he has to learn both ways, and it adds to the assignments he has to learn. If you flip your people, you have to worry about jumps. If they are flipping, they have to get set in their alignment. If you don't flip, all they have to do is get ready to play. We don't flip our people anymore.

We run a drill about three times a week called "early work." We take our inside people. We work best on best and run traps, reach, scoops, and cutoff blocks. We do this drill before practice. After we work on those things, we put the offense and defense together and work seven on seven.

Let's get into the practice schedule and what we do on the field. Nothing fancy goes on out there. The first thing we do is stretch. I work with the snappers and kickers, but they do their stretching on their own. We work on our flexibility. The guys may be big, but the game is played with bent knees. I think we take too much time from practice to stretch. I tell them to get stretched out. I don't care when they do it, walking across campus on the way to practice or coming out to practice, but I'm not going to take practice time for them to stretch. You hope they don't do this, but it could happen. A guy gets into a fight. He can't say, "Hey, John, wait five 5 minutes; I've got to stretch and get loose." We get loose during our drill work.

The first drill we do is a bag drill. They step over the bags and stretch. At the end of the bags, I have them do some kind of football-related finish. The first time, I may have them recover a fumble. The second time, I may roll the ball, and they have to pick it up and score. The third time, I may throw the ball to them. The fourth time, they have to tip it to someone else. Then I may have someone there to form tackle. There are all kinds of things that you can do during the warm-up period.

There are ways to recover a fumble. If you are not getting done what you want to get done, keep your players after practice and make them do it right. When you are trying to recover a fumble, never get on your back. Grab the ball, lock it down with the arms, and pull up the knees and hips. When they come in on the ball, if they don't bend their knees, they'll kick the ball. We work on this every day.

You can make your players bend their knees and run quickly over the bags. To teach our kids to bend their knees, we do a drill called hand-touch knee bends. The player gets his butt down and face up, bends his knees, and puts his hands on the ground. We run three or four players at a time. We start them out with their feet straight up the field. You can't push off and have good
