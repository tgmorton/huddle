and bending your knee. We want to look as if we are in a racehorse position, or jockey position, ready to kick back and go into our pass set.

We do the drill sideways. Then they get bored with that. Now we do a circle. We have them touch the ground as they go around the circle. We stress space awareness. We have a small receiver who made the best catch I have ever seen because he could make a change from one shoulder to the other shoulder and reach for the ball at the last second to make the catch. That is why we do space awareness. It incorporates those kinds of movements. Those are called tape or line hops.

We do jump-rope drills. In the summer, when we get into line hops and the players get bored, we tell them to get a jump rope. Now we have them do the line hops with the rope. Now it is more difficult. Then they get good, and we tell them to turn the rope backwards. We just keep doing the same things, but we add a twist to make it harder.

Core work is any kind of AB work. We do a ton of AB work. If I am swinging a bat, 50 percent of the power that I generate with my legs will not get to the front of the bat if I am weak in my core. If I am a tackle and I try to reach a defender, this is what happens. How is he going to turn the man and press him if he is not strong in his ABs? Why do we get linemen with back problems? Is it because they squatted too much, too early? It is because they did not do core work. When they try to twist and turn the defender, they get thrown back on their backs. That is why they are getting back problems. It is a combination of a lot of things. We do a lot of core work. We do weighted ABs and nonweighted ABs. We twist and turn and throw medicine balls.

One of the things we do in pre-hab is this. We get on a bench press or a soft-surface bench and take our shoe off. Now the joint is unstable. I have to balance myself on one leg and come down and then come back up. We bend down on the one leg and then come back up. It does not matter if they are 150 pounds or 350 pounds. They have to be able to do this. Why? When they first start doing it, they are weak in the knee area. We have been very fortunate with knee injuries over the last four years. Part of that may be luck, but we feel the exercises help.

We do not sit down and stretch before we work out. We get ready, and we loosen up, but we do not sit down and work out. If it is a 6 A.M. workout, we line up, and the first thing we do is this. We go "break down, set, go." We go through our commands, whatever they are. They will change this year, as we have a new coach. Then the first thing we do is walking lunges. Our guys have to change directions down in a low position. That is why we do walking lunges. We come back with walking shuffles. "Squat, shuffle, step; squat, shuffle, step." They are going to get down low and change directions.

Next we go into our sprint skill drills. If any of you coach track, you know what I mean. It is A's and B's and all of that stuff. We do a couple of things differently. We will do skips. They are not grade-school skips, they are sprinter skips. I want the toe up, and I do not worry about the knee. If I do not have the toe up, I am not getting the correct mechanics. We go toe up, and we skip in that position. I want the arms at 90 degrees. It is what we call check to check.

After skips, we do butt kicks. We will do skip kicks or foreleg reaches. We do not do the hurdler stretch. It is fine if you are a hurdler or a sprinter, but these guys are football players. As soon as they start reaching, that is how they run faster. This is not true. You push when you run. That is all you do. If you reach, you land on your heel, and you are walking. It is just push. It is push, push, push. We do skips and butt kicks. We do slide kicks. We slide our ankle up by our knee. We do not do high knees. When kids do high knees, they want to lean back. You can't lean back when you sprint. If you do the high knees, you are teaching something wrong. We do skips, butt kicks, and slide kicks.

We work on arm action by having them sit down. They use the arms at 90 degrees. We go shoulder's height or cheek to cheek. They bring the elbow up high. We gradually increase the speed. We start out in the first
