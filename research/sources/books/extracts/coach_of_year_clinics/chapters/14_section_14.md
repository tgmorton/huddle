offensive tackle. That is generally the short side of the field. If he gets a weak set by the back, he widens to keep from getting cut off. The 3 technique is lined up ear hole to ear hole on the guard no matter what happens. He does not worry about getting reached. A 2 technique is outside ear hole to inside ear hole of the guard. The 4 technique is the same thing except on the tackle.

We play a 7, 6, and 9 technique on the tight end. On all of these techniques we are playing ear hole to ear hole. We do not ever want to be cut off and turned out. Players like Russell Maryland, Leon Lett, and Charles Haley never get reached. A player who gets reached is late coming off the ball. He is reading and not attacking. When he comes off the ball and attacks the blocker, he is in an attacking and power position. I want to lock up and drive the offensive blocker back off the line of scrimmage. After he starts to drive the offensive blocker back, he starts to maintain his gap responsibility. The mistake a lot of guys make is jumping outside when they see the reach drive block. When they do that, the blocker seats his block and drives the defense outside. The key to this technique is to get off the ball.

A type of attacking technique can get the defensive tackle upfield too far on some occasions. That makes him vulnerable to the draw-and-trap play. We work hard on down and distance to give our people a chance to think about what is coming.

We work on recognizing blocking schemes. Make your people complete football players. Make them think about down and distance so they are ready for the draw and trap. As our defensive linemen come off the line of scrimmage, they recognize the set and hand position of the offensive linemen. When they read the draw set, they start to squeeze to the inside. We don't want them to stop their charge, because if it is a playaction pass, it is hard to restart the charge in the pass rush. If the offensive lineman pops straight up and stutter-steps, it is a run.

Our defensive linemen run games and stunts, and we never tip them off. If defensive linemen look at where they are going, they tip the stunt to the offense. Offensive linemen look for the tip-offs. Teach your defensive fronts not to look where they are going. Teach them not to stagger their feet the way they are going.

One stunt we like to run is called ''ET.'' The E stands for end, and the T for tackle. The end goes first, and the tackle comes around. It is generally a weak-side stunt. The end comes down and works to the backfield. He has to get his feet moving and keep them moving. He keeps going until he is deep into the backfield. If he stops his feet from moving, he can lose his balance and fall. The defensive end has to make the tackle take him. If he stops working his feet, the tackle will read the stunt and come off on the defensive tackle coming around. The tackle comes off on the guard and bull-rushes the guard. He doesn't start his move to the outside until he sees the end come down. Again, this stunt requires the defensive linemen to come off the ball hard.

In the 4-3 defense, never let the 3 technique play in just one spot. Move him around. Put him on the inside pinch, or formation game. Use linebacker and defensive-line stunts to free up their playing area. If the inside tackles don't make things happen on defense, the defense is in trouble. If they don't make plays, your Mike linebacker will not be effective. Move the down 2s and 3s around as much as you can. The easiest block for the offensive tackle is when he knows the defensive end will never come inside of him.

In the pass rush we teach our linemen about the 3-, 5-, and 7-steps drop. We have to know what the offense likes to do. If they are a 3-step-drop passing team, our stunts have to be quick and short so that we can get our hands up in the quarterback's face. This goes back to down and distance. That helps your players to execute the plays you want from them. It lets your
