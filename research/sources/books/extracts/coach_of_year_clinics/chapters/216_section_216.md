We break all meetings just as we break the huddle. When we have finished, we say, "Ready, break." We all break and get out of the room. They should get sucked out of the room just as if there was a vacuum pulling them out of the room. They may visit for a minute, but they should move on to the next venue, which is probably the practice field. The sooner they can get out there, the better off you are. You only have a limited amount of time.

We want to be ahead of time, not on time. What is on time? If time were not important to us, we would not have clocks. We have clocks and calendars. If it is important, they need to be on time and ahead of time.

Next, I want to talk about systems, styles, and standards of play. A premium is placed on explosive movement and finish in football. This is true for offense or defense. It is the same with the kicking game. We need to be explosive, and we need to know how to finish. What is finish? How do you practice finish? You have to build this into your practices. It is as simple as that. People do not naturally finish things. They do not finish things in the classroom or any other venues that we have talked about unless you insist that they finish them.

We play a lot of situational football. So do you. Everyone does in this day and age. That is true for special teams, offense, or defense. In our concept of football, we are going to play a lot of players. Last year we had to. Some of them did not want to stay on the field. "Get your butt back out there! I don't care, we are behind. You stay out there and play." We have a lot of guys to play. We think that is healthy. We think it is healthy for the general mental health of our football team. Situational football gives you an opportunity to use a lot of players. You can build them a role. When you do that, they are less inclined to detach from your program or feel as if they are not making a viable contribution. Everyone wants simplicity and flexibility. Those are by-words in football. The good coaches are the ones who can simplify things and take the complexity out of things. They reduce it to the simplest terms and impart it to their players. Timing is of the essence. Time is of the essence in the game, of the essence in preparation.

We do not compromise on work ethics. We stress intensity and finish. We do not compromise work ethic at all. We can't afford to, even if we were a great team-and we all know that we were not-but if we were a great team, and I have been around some great teams. The difference in two teams' playing is that the great team knows how to maintain concentration throughout and finish what they start. They have to practice those things. They have to understand the importance of those things. These points do not come naturally. It isn't natural to finish. It isn't natural to practice hard and to work hard in the practice setting. That is a dress rehearsal. Practice should be harder than the game. We want machinelike proficiency. We must be concise. Unit play is critically important. The team comes first. There is strength in numbers. The team will always come first. Any player who insists on a guaranteed start is taking the first step in getting put out of our program. There are no start guarantees in our business. You are a better team when you have competition between positional candidates. If someone wants a start guarantee, that is not the spirit of the business.

The team always comes first. It always has and always will. That is the thing that is unique about the game of football. We are the only sport that plays with that many people. You may have between 75 and 110 players on your squad. We have between 105 and 108, counting the walk-ons. We have 85 on scholarship. It is a unique game. That is a lot of people to manage and to get to concentrate and finish collectively. It is a lot of players to get to play together as a team. They must put the team as the number one priority and not themselves. It is important for you to home in on that and for your players to understand that.

When you have a meeting and you feel uncomfortable with one of the players, get that crap straight right away. "What is the problem, Mortimer? You have a funny look on your face. You look like you just had a crap sandwich and did not like the taste. We can't have that. I can't talk to you about line stunts with that look on your face. So, what the hell is the matter?" We will sit down and talk about it. I have to find out what the problem is.
