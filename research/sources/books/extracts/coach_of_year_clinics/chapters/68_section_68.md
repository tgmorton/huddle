The BYU Passing Game

Brigham Young University

Thank you. It is good to be here in Hawaii with you guys. I was a high school coach for eight years. They buried my record so deep that nobody has ever found it. I never had any winning seasons. The only reason I got into college coaching is because I was the only Mormon in the world running the single-wing offense. Hal Mitchell took the job at BYU and wanted to bring back the single-wing to college. He hired me. It obviously didn't work. A year or so later Hal was relieved.

I became the head coach there in 1972. The only reason I mention this is because a lot of you coaches are faced with the problems I had. When I was coaching high school football, for the first five years I didn't have an assistant who had played football, let alone played in college or had any experience. I finally got one who had some experience, and that helped considerably.

When I went to BYU as an assistant, they had averaged about three victories a year for the first 47 years they had played major college football. They never had a winning season or won any type of championship. They were thinking about giving up football. After we got things turned, it has gone on from that to be a very successful program. We have had a great deal of success over the past 20 years.

In this business there are the "haves" and the "have nots." If you are a ''have," no matter what you do, you will be successful. If you are a "have not" at a place like ours, you have to be creative. You have to do some things a little differently. You really have to work at it. BYU is definitely a "have not." We try to create a different approach.

I had never thrown the football. For the 10 years that I was an assistant at BYU, I was a defensive coach. I worked for two coaches over that 10-year period. When I was appointed head coach, it was not a matter of 
if 
was going to get fired, it was 
when. 
That was the history of the way things had been going at BYU. There are about four or five key words that I stress a lot with our team and staff. Particularly with my staff, since I don't do a lot of coaching myself anymore. We have a veteran staff. I try to set the tone for what we want to accomplish.

Attitude is everything. It is an elusive thing, but to create an attitude is so important. One of the greatest stories I've every heard comes from a guy named Bob Blackman. He coached at Dartmouth and Illinois. I heard him speak one time at a clinic. He told this story. This great big tackle got married to this tiny girl. On their wedding night after all the activities were over, they were in the room together alone. He took off his pants, handed them to her, and told her to put them on. She told him that was crazy; they were too big. She said, "I can't wear these pants." He said, "That's right. Let's establish that fact right now; I'm going to wear the pants in this family." She said, "Fine." A little while later in the evening, she took her panties off. She tossed them to him and told him to put them on. He said, "Are you crazy? I can't get in those panties." She said, "That's right. And there is no way you're going to unless you change your attitude.'' She got to the heart of what attitude is all about.

I am not here to convert anyone to do what we do. Hopefully, you can gain an idea that will fit into what you are doing. That is my sole purpose for being here. That is the way it is with motivation. That motivation has to come from within. I don't believe in fear motivation. I don't coach that way. I work our guys hard, but I'm always talking to them about creating that attitude, that intensive desire to be successful.

Our guys believe that when we go into a game, we are going to win. No matter how bad or ugly things are, they believe we can pull out the win. It hasn't always been that way. I don't know all the keys to motivation. All I know is you have to have that attitude.
