Nine Commandments

1. Play your best players on defense. Defense is what wins championships. A good pitcher can shut down a good hitting team.

2. Gamble only for a purpose. This applies to gap control and reading defenses with man or zone coverages.

3. Defend the field. We may force the offense to go back to the short side of the field where we can use the boundary for help. We use man-to-man coverage a great deal of the time. This was especially true this past year because of the great speed we had in the secondary. We had three players who could run a 4.5, so we played a lot of man coverage.

4. Never get beat by our alignment. We try to keep our adjustments as simple as possible. We cover the types of blocks each player will see in the game and how we want them to defend against these blocks.

5. Go to automatic fronts on certain calls. Some offensive sets will predict what front we want to play. If you have better personnel, it will not make a lot of difference, but if you do not have better personnel, you may need to play certain fronts against some offensive sets.

6. Defend the obvious. We believe certain situations have a high probability for special type of plays. We must play the odds against these special plays.

7. Defend dangerous personnel. We like to take away the most dangerous threat while maintaining a general defense. Control is the key word. Never weaken your other areas in an effort to stop an outstanding player.

8. Defend what the offense does best. Tendencies are the key. Focus on what your opponents do best and their best players. By disrupting the offensive game plan, we can enhance our chances for success.

9. Keep the adjustments simple and easy. We must be able to adjust to unexpected formations. We simply call time out. We must be ready for shifts and motion. Big adjustments during a game are a gamble. You must make them for a definite reason. One key for us is to only use what we have had the opportunity to practice on and to perfect during practice.

As you know, you can only play with the players you have. This fact is very important in developing the defensive game plan.

Next, I want to get to our defensive front. I went to Marshall University and got a lot of help from Coach Tim Billings. want to cover the points Coach Billings went over with me.

1. The first thing to stress is position. It is important to stress stance and alignment.

2. You must learn to step to the gap. You need to learn to go from either hand.

3. The toe should be pointed straight ahead. Knees and feet should be straight. The shoulders should be pointed straight upfield and with a toe-to-heel relationship with the feet.

4. Foot back should be the foot to the shade man.

5. Start with two steps: Back foot first, right foot, step into man. Thumbs up, elbow straight, as if you are taking a picture.

6. Make a line six inches away. Don't step over the line. The foot replaces the hand. The hand comes with the foot. Hand above eyes, sit on heels, lift man up and out. Hips down, thumbs up, elbows in. Lead with the eyes and hands. Face into target, look for ball through gap, and feel pressure. Remember to have a comfortable stance, short step pick, a target area; punch press; slide and escape; don't turn your shoulders. Always teach hands first, feet second.

7. Three ways to control the gap are (a) my body, (b) his body (if he reaches me, knock him back), (c) my eyes (locate ball, pursuit drill).
