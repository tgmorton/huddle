Developing the High School Offense

Lima Senior High School, Ohio

Thank you very much, Ken. It certainly is a pleasure for me to be here. We ordered our state championship rings a few weeks ago. I told the rep making the rings that I was going to be speaking at the Louisville clinic and that I wanted a ring that everyone could see. I told him I wanted the best thing he had. I hope everyone can see this ring.

We have had a great experience. We were invited to the State House, and we went on the floor of the senate with all of our kids. That was a neat thing for all of us. We did win our league this year; it was the first time ever. We did win the state championship, which was the first time ever.

When Earl Browning called me to speak at this clinic, I told my wife that I had finally arrived. This really means something special to me.

I played at the University of Kentucky under Charlie Bradshaw. Some of the things that I am going to talk to you about today we did years ago. I learned a lot of football, and I learned how 
not 
to treat players and people. I learned how to treat people, and I learned about hard-nosed football. That is what we play in our league. That is why we were able to win the state championship.

I am going to talk with you about some of our coaches. We use some volunteer coaches in our program. I will talk to you later about the volunteer coach and how important that is to our system. I am sure a lot of you have the same situation. We have an open date next year. It is our 10th date, which is October 31. We are interested in a game for that date. I am also the athletic director at our school, so if you are interested, see me. We are in a bind for this date. There is only one school in Ohio that has that date open, and they will not play us. We would be willing to play anyone. If interested, let me know.

If you are not familiar with Ohio high school football, this next section will not mean a lot to you. Some of you from this area will recognize some of the schools we played last year, especially the Cincinnati schools. To put things into perspective, this is the schedule we played this year:

The point I want to make is this. You can see by our scores that we had a lot of close games. You have to win the close games to have a great year. Again, I am the athletic director, and I am the one who set it up. I
