happened. I'm going to study that play and find out how and why it broke down. If I'm the problem, I have to change it. I have to go back and find a better technique to allow that kid to be successful. If the answer to question number one is no, then I ask question number two. If I'm not coaching that technique, I must be allowing it to happen over and over again because I'm seeing that same stuff week after week. That's it. If you will live by that creed, you will start to see a change in your players.

I talk in clinics across the country. I talk to corporations, businessmen, salesmen, coaches, and players about goal setting and success. I talk about what you have to do in order to improve yourself from poor to average, from average to good, from good to great. To have those good years, you have to be able to effect change in the people around you. You are an average coach if you can't effect change. You are a baby-sitter. You are monitoring those players for two or three hours. There are lots of ways to go about effecting change. Some of these things are positive, and some are negative.

Individual drills are important to linebackers. I want to talk to you about my beliefs. Some of the exhibitors in the back aren't going to like this. It is my philosophy on coaching aids. Jack Pardee taught me this. I came from high school to the college level coaching linebackers. Jack was a Hall-of-Fame pro linebacker, and he was looking over my shoulder at everything I did. My philosophy is this, and he taught it to me: I am not really big on a lot of coaching aids during the season. You have to have certain dummies. You have to have a few cones and sleds. I understand that, but that sled is not going to knock his jock off on Friday night. Jack told me to get all that stuff done during the off-season. He told me I could have one drill with the coaching aid. "Anything past that, and you are out of here." He said he wanted to see them tackling, shedding, striking, covering, and running. He wanted to see them do those things the way they were going to do it on Saturday afternoon. I still use a few things, but not many, and only one a day.

We have a 20-minute, live, get-after-your-butt, special-teams period. That pretty much has our players warmed up before we start the individual periods. Still, there are a few guys each day who are not involved in the special-teams period who need to be warmed up. I'll start the individual period out with some sort of a warm-up. I'm going to emphasize stance and the first step as much as I can at the starting point of that warm-up period. I coach eyes, stance, and first step as they gradually warm up.

From there, I am going to some kind of full-speed, ballistic footwork drill. I want a change-of-direction and quick-movement drill to get all the muscles loosened up before we get into the contact period.

Every day, we are going to do certain things. It may be in a different order, but we do it every day. We do an upper-body strike-and-shed drill. We do a lower-body strike-and-shed drill. They learn how to get in a fit position and how to strike with their upper body and shed. They learn how to play the cut block. They strike and shed that block. They are going to learn how to play football through a few coaching aids and a few other bodies.

If you want to know whether your team was ready to play in a game in which you just got your butt kicked, look at the tackling. The number one indicator of whether your team was prepared and ready to play that night is tackling. If they tackled like crap, they weren't prepared. If you are a defensive football coach, you know that doesn't come naturally. Tackling is not natural. It is something you have to work on every single day. I am at the NFL level, and we tackle every day. I'm 38 years old. I've got guys as old as I am, but we are going to tackle every day. You have to emphasize the same points in tackling over and over.

As a defensive football coach, our number one thing is "don't let them score and get the ball back for the offense." That is it. It is not a hard game. Turnovers don't happen by accident. You have to teach guys how to strip the ball and knock it out. You have to teach them how to intercept the ball. Players in our three major position areas are not allowed to come out of the individual period unless the head coach sees a turnover drill every single day.
