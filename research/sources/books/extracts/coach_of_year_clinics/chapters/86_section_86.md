he is balanced up. We can't let him do that. For the first three series of every game, we are going to bull rush. The first thing I want that offensive lineman to do is to start to lean. If you hit that guy enough under his chin, he starts to lean into you. When he does, your pass-rush techniques are going to work.

When we bull-rush, we have to feel the offensive linemen. I saw this in a 49er camp. They blindfold their pass rushers. The offensive blocker retreats in the bull rush. At some point the offensive lineman has to make a stand to keep from being pushed back into the quarterback. When he locks back and leans into the defense is when we pull him forward and go around him. We don't use the blindfold, but we do close our eyes. It is the feel they have to recognize. The setup is the bull rush, which is designed to get the guy leaning forward.

With our 3 technique and noseguard, we use a head fake. All they do is jab to the outside, club to the inside, and rip underneath. We are trying to move the offensive linemen's weight to one side or the other. In the power rush, we work the offensive linemen to the outside of our pass lane, then rip and come inside. We do these things within the confines of our lanes.

Pass rush is attitude, effort, and toughness. Football is a physical game. We always look for those types of guys.

In the drill is where you have to be creative. This is where football gets boring. I have never had a player who liked individual drills. They want to scrimmage. The first drill that I like to use is a pass-rush drill. This is a toughness drill. Sometimes I have trouble with the head coach over this drill because it gets out of hand at times. I want to find out how tough he is, whether he wants to get to the quarterback, and whether he won't give up. It is also a good conditioning drill.

The drill has two offensive blockers on one pass rusher. The first lineman engages the defensive rusher at the line of scrimmage. The second blocker waits in reserve. If the rusher gets past the first blocker, he has to take on the second blocker. The first man now drops in back to take on the rusher again. The drill continues until the rusher gets to the quarterback or the whistle blows. If the rusher gets there, the offense has to do 20 up-downs. You can tell a lot about your players from this drill.

In this next drill I have an offensive man on a defensive man. I use two dummies and two backs on each. The ball carrier is in the tailback position. All blocks are base blocks. I point to the back who I want to carry the ball. On the snap of the ball, the offensive man tries to block the defensive man's butt off. The back runs through the bags. The defensive man has to use his vital techniques to get to the ball carrier. The first thing he has to do is neutralize the blocker. In the beginning, most of the defenders are trying to see which back is coming. They are not focused on the blocker and end up in my lap.

The first thing you are going to find out is where that defender is looking. I tell the offense that holding is legal, so he grabs the defender. If the offense can hold him, he didn't lock out. The young guy finally gets the lockout completed and goes for the tackle. The offensive man will bury him, because he did disengage. You can see all the mistakes from the results that occur. This drill teaches the progression to the tackle. We don't put the backs on the ground. We form tackle.

I can stand behind the drill and see all the vital techniques. We videotape this drill. The biggest problem they all have is trying to watch the ball carrier. This probably is the best drill we do. It covers everything.

I adjust the depth of the backs and the width of the dummies to the skill of the players. For the younger players, I tighten the dummies and move the ball carrier back. With our older players, I challenge them. I put the dummies wider and the backs closer. I determine that by how happy I am or how much I want them to do well or not so well. With the young guys, the ball carriers are about 8 yards deep. The great defensive linemen that I've had fight pressure naturally. They are instinctive. Wrestlers are good at that. I love to coach wrestlers on the defensive line because they have a knack for fighting pressure.
