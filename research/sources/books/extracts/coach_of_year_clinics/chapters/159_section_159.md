Wednesday is kind of a day off from the weight room. We are still going to do strength work, because we are going to go on the field and do some agilities. We have a long warm-up. We do speed skill drills for 15 minutes. Then we are going to loosen up. Then we do a few agilities. They may get 12 to 16 reps in agilities. Compare that to a morning mat drill program: They get 60 reps in 30 minutes; we get 12 to 16 reps in about 15 minutes. Our intensity is higher, but our tempo or our workout is lower. That is because they get plenty of rest. Once they finish that part of the workout, we do some running, but not hard. Then we lie down and stretch for 10 minutes. It is like track practice. We do 20 minutes of work in one hour. We are trying to recover from the day before. The next day will be a squat day.

We come in on Thursday and do our warm-up. Now we go over, get on a platform, and do light hanging shrugs, hanging cleans, front squats, and press. It is just technique work. It is nice and smooth, but it is going to get them loose to hit that low position. Then we hit something fairly fast, but with a very light load. Now we get under a squat bar. We use all safety squat bars. It is a safety bar with a big yoke that comes down, with handles that you can hold on to. The problem with lower backs is that when you get into too much work or you get into too much sheer force with the back forward, the angle is shearing down through the disk. If you sit up straight and squat and put the load straight down, you have pure compression force that the body is built to handle. So we use the safety squats. Again, our guys are long-waisted and long-legged.

Instead of wearing me and them out trying to get them to do it right, because dynamically and physically they can't do it, we just use the safety squat. We get them in there and go, "Racket, handles, grab hold, deep breath, wide knees, sit, and here we go, baby." We just load the weight on them. I do not have to coach technique. I can coach to get stronger. Weights, weights.

We have three players who squat 900 pounds on a safety squat. If it were a straight bar, I would guess it would be about 750 pounds. These guys can really squat. They do not have to work on bending over or technique. They just get in the weight room, and most of them do not even wear a belt. We squat max one time per year in March. We will power-clean three or four times per year. That is because the athlete is in control. If he gets into trouble, he can get away from it. On squats I have to have three men on the same page helping me out of the box. The squat max scares me to death.

After we finish squatting, we go jump up on boxes. If you are a long-jumper, what kills you? It is not the jump; it is the landing. If you are doing jump training, what is going to kill you? It is the landing. So we go over to a box, and we jump up on the box. Now we walk down the boxes. I have to jump high, but I walk back down. I can always jump up.

If we want to work on reactive strength, like cutting and changing directions, we walk up and jump turned to the side of the box. If we are working on starting strength, we will walk up to the box, pause, and then jump. If we want to work on reactive strength on the platform, we do a hang clean or a hang snatch. It is down-up. Stress reflex up. If we want to work on starting strength, we will work power clean from the floor. What are pulls? Pulls are cleans, but we do not rack it. I pull it and let go. Why do I want to pull and then let go? What kills you in a clean? It is not the pull, but the catch. Now I can go a little heavier, pull it, and then let go. No problem. It is the same reason we jump on boxes. We alternate pulls on Tuesday and Thursday. We can alternate those in and out and end up going heavier.

After we finish the squats and finish box jumping, we go out and run. On Thursday we run 130s. It is over distance with a nice, easy stride. How do you do that? It is from one corner to the opposite corner of the football field. We do six 130s. We have three guys across, and we stride to the corners. Then we walk across. When the group gets to the starting point, they go. Then they walk back across the field. We do not run a lot in any one day, but we run every day.

On Monday we are fast. On Tuesday we have power. I have strength, and I have some speed left. Wednesday
