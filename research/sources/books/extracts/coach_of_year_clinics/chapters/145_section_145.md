We play 1, 5, and 9 technique to the left. To the right, we play the tackle in a 3 and the Leo in a 6 technique. The bubble linebacker is left, and the stack linebacker is right. The corner takes the flanker to the left side. To the back side, the strong safety moves up into a monster position, and the corner plays back on the second tight end in a safety position. We play a read support on the back side. We are in an eight-man front with everyone gapped up. The linebackers are fast-flowing.

If the offense came out with both the tight ends on the same side in a wing set and a split end on the back side, nothing changed. The call was still "left." We left our corner on that side with the wing. We played a read scheme to the wing and a sky call to the split end.

The next look we got predominant in the Big Ten was what we called "snake." That was two tight ends and one back. When we get this set, we make a stud call. What that meant was to study your formations. When they do this, they generally run to one of those tight ends and throw to the other. It might be the same guy, but normally it isn't. Normally, they have a big-ass blocking tight end and a little pass-receiving tight end. We set our linebacker on the running tight end and the safety aligned on the pass-receiving tight end. If the run tight end was left, our linebacker would make a left call.

The Willie linebacker will align on the blocking tight end and make a stud left call. The safeties balance opposite Willie linebacker. We are back into an eight-man front. We take away the tight zone play and plays of that nature.

Let me get into the man principles from this defense. This is something we did this year that was new for us. I went to visit with the 49ers last year. This is something they did that really helped us in our running-game defense. We could call this defense in all downs and distances. It ended up being a man-free defense with a four-man rush. Also, one of the linebackers would end up being a hole or half player. We got good mileage out of this defense against all situations. We called it "tight scarlet key." It has the same principles as the tight zone. Before, we were going to zone, whatever formation the offense would come out in. Now we are going to man all formations.

If the offense comes out in one tight end, two backs, and two wide receivers, the linemen do not change. We could change the linemen's gaps with line calls. But as a base defense, the line stays the same. We let our kids move around in the defense. But they must be smart enough to know that when the ball is snapped, they have to be in position. The Willie linebacker can move outside, inside, wide, or tight, but when the ball is snapped, he attacks the tight end with an outside-in attitude. He is predominant a pass player. He is playing man coverage on the tight end with an outside-in attitude. It is a very easy read for him. There are only two blocking schemes that he has to defend. The first is the tight end attacking him. If that happens, he punches and gets his hat to the outside in the D-gap area. If the tight end blocks down on a low hat release,
