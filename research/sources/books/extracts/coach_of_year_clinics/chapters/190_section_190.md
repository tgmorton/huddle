The FSU Offensive Package

Florida State University

Thank you. I'm going to get started and cover as much of our package as I can. Every year when we start spring training, we start in the I formation. We start in the I formation, run the football, and throw the playaction pass. Once we get that established as well as we can, we go to split backs, with two wide receivers and a tight end. From that we are going to throw and run the ball as well as we can. Then we go to three wide receivers, no tight end, and two backs. From there we progress to four wide receivers, no tight end, no fullback, and one tailback. I'm going to touch briefly on each one of these personnel groups. If I have time, I'll mention something about our goal line and shortyardage package.

We have come to the conclusion that we have to be diversified in college football. We cannot be a onedimensional football team. We have to be able to run and throw the ball. That is what we strive for every spring and fall.

We want to be able to do equally well, whether we are in the I, split-backs, or one-back set. We don't want to give a defense an advantage by personnel group. We don't want the defense to know what we are going to do from a certain set. The same is true of the formation we are in.

Each spring, we start in the I formation, and the first play we try to establish is the toss sweep. We have been blessed with some great tailbacks. The tailback for us has to be a multidimensional player. He has to be a runner first and a pass receiver second. In the I formation, we put him 8 yards deep. One great thing about the I formation is that it gives the I back a chance to see the field. He is 8 yards deep with his shoulders square to the line of scrimmage, and he is in a twopoint stance. He has the chance to use his God-given ability of vision to run where they aren't.

The fullback's feet are at 5 yards. That puts his hands down at approximately 4 yards from the tip of the football. Our splits are two feet between the center, guard, and tackle. We have a three-foot split between the tackle and tight end. If the ball is in the middle of the field, our wide receiver's split will be halfway between the hash mark and the sideline.

I'll draw up an eight-man front to show you this play. More and more people are starting to crowd the line with their safeties. They are getting their safeties involved in run support. That is another reason to be diversified and not run the ball every time. We always put our tight end on the defensive end, no matter what technique he is. The tight end blocks the defensive end in the 6, 7, 9, or wide 9 technique. He takes his steps according to where the defensive end is aligned.

If the tight end has an inside shade, he takes an inside zone step. He squares his hips and tries to knock the defensive end back off the football. We try to establish a new line of scrimmage. The tackle always blocks the defensive tackle. It doesn't matter if he is a 3, 4-eye, 4, or leverage technique. He wants to prevent the tackle from spinning back into the play. He knocks him upfield as much as he can. The tight end and tackle need to get squared up as much as they can so that they can knock their men back toward their goal line as opposed to knocking them down.

The guard pulls and looks for the run support. He tries to cut the outside hip of the strong safety. If the strong safety comes up on the line and blitzes, the tight end gives the guard an alert call. The guard knows the strong safety is blitzing and kicks him out. Also, the tailback can see that.

The center has the strong A gap. He gets a full scoop into that gap. The split-side guard hard-scoops the knees of the 1-technique shade tackle. The split tackle comes hard inside for the backside B gap. We flip-flop our offensive line. We have a tight guard and tackle, and a split guard and tackle.
