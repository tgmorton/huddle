something positive about each player. At Copperas Cove we had 70 to 80 players that we asked about. No one had anything positive to say about Chester Jordan. He had duck feet, and they stuck out to the side when he walked down the hall. He had a big butt and duck feet. Finally, I asked the track coach about Chester. He said, "The best thing I can say about Chester is this. He was my manager for the track team last year. When we would go to track meets away from home, Chester could eat a whole loaf of bread and a jar of mayonnaise in one meal." We took him and started working with him because he was big. The good thing about Chester was the fact that you could not go around him very fast. For sure, you could not go through him.

At the halfback spots, we would have little players who were good athletes. They would try hard for you. On the outside, I would cheat on Coach Majors. I would not put the two wide receivers on the strong side on the board. I would get two basketball players and put them outside. I put them out wide because I knew they were not going to hit anyone. You could not wad them up and throw them on anyone. I would make a little deal with them. All during the football season they did not have to come to a certain part of the practice. They could go in the gym and work on basketball. I would let them go in the gym. Then during basketball season, two days a week they would come with me, and we worked on throwing and catching the football. We did that all year long, and the two got really good at the skills of the game. We only asked them to do a few things.

We would find a man at the wideout that could run the curl. The inside man would need to know how to run a flat and a wheel route. That is the way we set up our attack. We ended up leading the state of Texas in passing. We won some games that the school had not won before. The kids felt good about the program, and I moved on to a college job.

The thing that carried over was in keeping within the philosophy. At the split end, we had a man who could catch the ball over his shoulder. At the halfbacks, we had players who could catch the ball underneath. The left halfback may not always be the best runner, but he would be able to come out of the backfield and catch the ball. He knew how to get open when you played in the street. I always ask the kids this question: "If you were playing street ball, who would be the first man you would pick as your receiver?" It would always be the halfback. We would take that set and put our best athletes on the other side. We would teach them a couple of things. First, we would teach them what was covered and what was uncovered. In high school football, you can look out on the field a lot of times and find the defender covering the split end, who has his feet 10 yards from the line of scrimmage. To me, that is not coverage. We had a signal when we had that coverage. We would have the quarterback take the ball, even in the shotgun, and he would just rise up, throw the ball outside to the split end, and let him be one on one with that defender at 10 yards. We worked on the play and found out that the break point was about 7 yards deep. If the defender was at 7 yards, we had to start looking at the scouting report. If the defender was at 7 yards and really quick, you do not want to throw the ball to the split end. If the defender was on the slow side, we would do it. We got the quarterback and the split end to understand what was covered and what was not covered.

We were going to force teams to bring the corner up. Since that was our fastest man, if the defense brought the corner up too close, we would send the split end right on by him. We just started working on that play. If the defender came up really tight, we would run by him and throw the ball over the top. If the defender got in the 7-yard area and we did not think we could beat him with the quick pass, we would run him deep.
