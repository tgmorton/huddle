Developing High School Quarterbacks

Berwick High School, Pennsylvania

Men, it is good to be back in the state of Kentucky. I was in Kentucky exactly 30 years ago. I was down in Lexington. The weather is a little different this time. Thirty years ago it was hotter than hell in Lexington. It is good to be here, and I want to congratulate those of you who are here for coming out to this clinic. I am an administrator in our high school. There is something about football coaches. I am the assistant superintendent in our school system. I have always made other teachers mad in our system. I tell them this: "If you people would work at your job as hard as the football coaches work at their job, no one would be able to touch us as far as education goes." I am sure they do not want to hear that. Men, I mean that. It is a pleasure to be here. I congratulate those of you who have come here to try to learn one or two things to help you become a better football coach.

My topic today is developing high school quarterbacks. Before I talk about the X's and O's, I want you to know that we are not a big high school, but we do play the big high schools. Some of you may say that we get a lot of talent at our school. That is true. But we handpick our quarterback. We have 350 boys in our school. We played the 4A schools. Our whole schedule was against 4A schools. I am not going to bullcrap with you. I will tell you how we approach quarterbacks and how we teach them, and I will take you through the things we do with our quarterbacks. I have four grad assistants who will assist me with the demonstrations.

I have had 13 Division I quarterbacks since 1971.1 think it all has something to do with the way we approach the quarterback position. It has to do with the way we pick the quarterback and how we work with the quarterback.

There are two things that I feel are important in developing the quarterback. Number one is mechanics. You can coach the hell out of mechanics, which we do. The second phase of it is decision making. We have 210 players in our program from 7th grade to 12th grade. Every kid in Berwick plays football unless you are handicapped or an oddball. We tell them we will teach them the quarterback mechanics, and we also do a segment on decision making. I have had some great quarterbacks. I had Powlus, Kelchner, and Orlando, who is now with the Cincinnati Bengals. Those quarterbacks were decision makers. I do not give a darn how far a kid can throw the football. I do not want to hear that. There are kids that look good in the punt, pass, and kick contest. I want the player who can make decisions. A quarterback is a decision maker under duress. When the pressure is on the quarterback, he must make a quick decision. That is the kind of kid we want. We have a way of training those players.

We start with the mechanics, men. We break the mechanics down into two areas: passing mechanics and running mechanics. First, I want to go over the passing mechanics. I will not be able to get very far in the time I have today. I will go until they run me off the stage.

There are three things you must look at when you are trying to develop a quarterback as far as passing mechanics. First is developing the hands. Next is developing from the waist up. Third is developing from the waist down. We take the body and break it down into three areas. We spend a lot of time on the last two-from the waist up and from the waist down.

Some of you may wonder what I am talking about in regard to the hands. I have been in coaching 30 years, and I can tell you that you do not want a kid in your program who has bad hands. We want a player with good hands to handle the ball on every down. That includes games when the field is wet and muddy. How many of you ever looked at the hands of your quarterbacks when you picked them? Have you ever looked at their hands? I have 21 quarterback
