Multiple Defenses and Stunts

East Bank High School, West Virginia

It is a pleasure to be here with you. I hope we can make a few suggestions that may help you and your program. I have my staff with me today, and I want to introduce them. Neil Hopkins is our defensive coordinator. John Hopkins is our offensive and defensive end coach. Tommy Canterbury is our offensive and defensive backs coach. Jon Carpenter works with offensive ends, and Brian Massey is our quarterback coach.

We have been very fortunate at East Bank High School in that we have won four state AA championships in the last eight years. We are located in the Kanawha Valley, close to Charleston, West Virginia. We have about 450 students in the top three grades. East Bank may be better noted as the home of the famous basketball star Jerry West. Jerry is now general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers.

Before we start on our clinic topic, I would like to let you know that we know that there are other qualities that make you a winner. After our season is over, we sit down and have each player who is returning next year write down our team goals and his personal goals for the next football season. We feel this helps the players to understand their role on the team the next year. When we write down these goals, we always leave the "I" out. You do not find the letter "I" in team goals. When we talk with them as a group, we tell them how important it is to be better than they were last year. "You must be willing to put forth a lot of extra effort, and you must be coachable with discipline to win.'' Discipline is the key word. Discipline is important in our program if we want to have a chance to win. We feel the off-season is the best time to install discipline and create a feeling to treat everyone equally.

We believe in stressing the academics all year at East Bank High School. You cannot win if your players are in the stands and not on the field. I am sure most of you have heard the statement that athletes win games and coaches lose games. Let me tell you, if you are to win, then athletes must make the grade and be on that football field. It is your responsibility to get the players on the field. Our athletes are also recognized for their success in the classroom. We have a special page with the players' pictures in the football program for students who maintain a 3.0 or better GPA. They are also given special recognition at our assemblies. Our ultimate goal is someday to have a complete team picture on that 3.0 GPA page!

We also believe in our weight program. I am not an expert in the weight program, but I do know if you are bigger and stronger, you have a better chance to win. One has to understand that football is played from the chin up. If they have confidence in their strength, they are going to win for you. Athletes must have a good image of themselves and believe in what you are doing in your program. If you have any questions about our weight program, let me know after the lecture, and I will be glad to visit with you. We also weigh and measure our athletes at the start of the weight program. We weigh and compare them two times during the off-season to see if they are getting bigger and stronger. All of the athletes like to see their names on the weight charts, and they like to follow their progress. Again, recognition is a big part.

We have a few signs we like to stress. "UnityWinning is a weekly affair." We feel you must have a group effort. Painted on our locker room wall is this sign: "Bad boys of AA." Another sign we stress is this: "Pain is temporarypride is forever.'' We tell our players that we love them. We let them know that they mean a lot to our coaching staff.

Now, getting into the defensive game plan, we have what we call our nine commandments of defense. Let me cover them for you quickly. These points are based on our philosophy and our perception of the weaknesses and strengths of our personnel, and they are based on our players' ability to learn each week.
