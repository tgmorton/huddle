I will show you the drills, and then I will show you the techniques that Burns taught me. We crowd the starting line and are a fist short of the line. If we have a tall player with long legs, it is going to be a fist and a thumb off the line. It does not matter which foot you put up. Your feet are going to be a fist's width apart, just as if you are in starting blocks. You want to scrunch up your back toe. It has to be turned under tightly. If it is pointed down but not turned under, we do not get the effect we need. Turn the back toe under really tight. If you are short, you need to get the back knee even with the front ankle. If you are long, it will be even with the back of your heel.

Next I want to lay my chest on my thigh. I look like an Olympic sprinter almost. I want to get my weight forward and my butt up. Now I want to get some posture. Here is the key to the whole thing. This is the coaching point. What is the front knee doing? That knee has to be ahead of the toe. When I start, I drive the lead hand shoulder high. I am going to be just like an offensive lineman and get the lead foot on the ground.

How do we teach the drills to do this? It is simple: mountain-climber starts. They get in a push-up position. I want to bring my right foot up even with my left knee, not any higher. As soon as it comes higher, they stumble. We have them come out of the stance in three steps. We say, "1, 2, 3, go." They go three at a time. They are not going full speed.

Next we go to scramble-up and go. They get down in a push-up position. They scramble up and go. We go on sound and movement. This is when I start having fun. This is how we do iton sound: "Ready, go. Next group. Go." Now we tell them that we are going on movement. "Ready, go." About half of them start out before they realize they are going on movement. We teach them to go on movement as well as sound.

The key to strength is the nervous system. This is something I learned from a coach at Washington. He is the assistant strength coach. He is a national or world-class power lifter. It goes back to training the nervous system. We have all done this. You get on a bench and you do 10, 8,6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 8,10. The 10, 8, 6, 4 are on the front side; when you use the same exact weight on the back side, it becomes easier. Why? Because once you get to the heavy set of 2 and you start coming down, your nervous system synthesizes to lifting heavier weight, so the sets of 4 and 6 feel lighter. So we do it on our front side in our workouts on our power lifts, that is, the squat and bench. We use as few sets and reps as we can to get to as heavy a weight as we are going to use that week. Our heaviest set is usually just one set. It does not matter if it is a set of eight at 65 percent or a set of three at 85 percent. It may be a set of two at 91 percent. We use as few sets as possible and conserve as much energy as possible so that we can get to that point. From there, we are going to go to work. Now you can see why Monday takes 30 minutes to bench-press. We will do 10 or 11 sets of bench press.

On Thursday we do 9 or 10 sets of squats, but it follows this pattern. Let's say we are doing a set of three at 85 percent. Next, we come back down and do four sets or five reps at 80 percent. The first two sets feel like nothing. Those third, fourth, and fifth sets are tough.

Now I am going to stay at 80 percent on the bench. Now I am going to double those reps. I do a set of 10 at 80 percent. You can't do that. It is impossible. They will burn out between the seventh and eighth set. That is how I keep track of them as far as getting stronger each week. How many reps did you get on the bench? "Eight, six, eight, ten." He is getting stronger through the month. If it is during the season, I have to adjust his max higher, even though we do not max during the season. But I know he is getting stronger because he did 10 reps. He can't do 10 at 80 percent. That is a max set. It is double what we are working at.

Key To Strength: The Nervous System

Here are the methods to develop strength: (1) max loads, one to three reps very heavy; (2) medium loads, four to six reps as fast as possible, best for high school athletes; (3) burnout set, 7 to 20 reps as quickly as possible with great technique. There is a book by Josef
