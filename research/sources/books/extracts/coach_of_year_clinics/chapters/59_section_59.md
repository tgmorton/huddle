SCISSORS

This is when crossing patterns work best. We do not run the pick with two ends. Once the end gets past the linebacker, he should be able to outrun him. Get him the ball when he clears. Against the zone, the split end underneath is open, unless the free safety comes up, and he never comes up. When we get in trouble, we run this play.

What should we put in our passing attack? What type of option should we run? In the spring we start working with our quarterbacks. We do not interfere with the other sports. We want other sports to be successful at Skyline. We want all sports to be successful at Skyline. If the quarterback is involved in one of the other sports, it is hard to work with him. We have most of our football team in our weight-training class. We have them most of the year. We do start working with the quarterback in the summer. We start working seven-on-seven drills. Some schools go out of state to do the seven-on-seven camps. We will go to one or two tournaments in Utah. By the end of the summer, I usually know how much passing we can do and how much we can't pass. I have an idea who can throw the ball and who can't throw the ball. I know who the good receivers are.

We do not start working on the option until our conditioning drills and our two-a-day practices. We spend most of our time trying to see whether we can do something passing the football. We need to be able to execute and look good on the play. If you win a state championship in Utah, then you get the privilege of coaching the All-Star Game. What a headache that can be. The All-Star Game is just before two-a-days. You do not get a lot of time before you get to the two-a-days, and you do not go in fresh, but the All-Star Game is a lot of fun. You get good players to coach. Energy-wise and time-wise, it kind of puts you behind. We got the all-stars for one week, and we were able to put in all of our offense. We had a simple option attack and a simple passing attack. We have coached three All-Star Games, and we are averaging 40 points for the three games. If you keep it simple and do not confuse the players, it will help. If I can understand it, they can understand it. How much coaching do you have to do with an all-star to run a streak?

The other part of our passing game involves the screen passes. I heard Coach Don Read of the University of Montana talk at a lecture. They were national champs in 1995 and runners-up in 1996 in Division II. He retired after winning the championship. He was a smart coach. Quit while you are on top. He said they worked 20 minutes a day on screen passes. I have never worked that much on screen passes. This past year we worked on it twice a week for 20 minutes each of the two days. It really helped us. The screen can be one heck of a play. Montana throws 11 or 12 screens per game. If you break that down, it comes out to two or three per quarter. They run a lot of different screens.

We threw two or three screens per game. It was a lot of fun, and they really worked. I will cover our wide receiver middle screen that we call "Millie." I like to give names to our pass plays. I give names to a lot of them. Our screen left is called "Sally." Our screen right is "Sara." Our middle screen is ''Millie." If it is coming from the opposite direction, we just call it "Millie Left.'' We do have a fullback screen, but we never used it in a game. It was fun to practice. The fullback had trouble catching the ball. We ran it in practice, but we did not use it in a game.
