not make our players wear knee braces on Friday. We are out for about one hour and 15 minutes. It is basically a mix-it-up day. We do a little of everything. We may be on the goal line 10 minutes or 15 minutes, depending on what we feel we need to work on.

Next, I want to show you a couple of sheets that we keep during the week in practice. It will not mean a lot to you, but they are sheets that you may want to develop. At the top of the sheet is "Mt. Carmel Running Game Tally Sheet." Along the top are all the formations that we use. Along the side are the even-numbered running plays and another list of the odd-numbered running plays. A lot of this is the same play but with different blocking schemes. In August and during the season, we have kids that keep a chart and tally the plays that we run. They tally those up so we know when we get into a game how many times we have run a particular play in practice. If we say that 32 and 33 are going to be big plays for us this week, we better make sure we are running enough of those plays in practice. We do the exact same thing with the passing game. You can develop your own chart or tally sheets. This is something I had my wife put together on the computer. We list all of our formations that we will use. Then we list all of our plays down the list. We have one area where we keep special down-and distance plays. We do not use all of our plays every week, but we have them listed. You can develop your own sheet to meet your need. One sheet is for the running game and one for the passing game.

Men, I am going to be here all night. If you want to sit down and talk about the things we do, I will be glad to visit with you. I am going to go very quickly on some of the things we do. Then I will let you see it on a videotape. I will cover the X's and O's with you later. I want to talk about our 36 and 37 outside-veer play. As you can see, we have one read, and we are going to react to the defensive back on the outside. If the linebacker scrapes, he will react to the linebacker. We teach the quarterback to cut up underneath the linebacker if he scrapes outside.

I would like to have someone come up so I can demonstrate how we run the option. I ask the running back to put his bottom hand across the belt. When we want to hand the ball off, we want to pronate the thumb down so the top of the hand is up. Notice how the elbow comes up when we turn the thumb down. It gives us a better pocket. On the outside veer, the quarterback is going to open at 4 o'clock, cross over and shuffle, shuffle. Now, can I tell you to take one long and two short steps? No! You have to work that out depending on the size of your quarterback. It is an individual technique.

The quarterback wants to get the ball into the pocket of the running back. If we want to give the ball to the running back, we simply pull the back hand, press with the front hand, and continue on. If the quarterback wants to keep the ball, he must read the end.
