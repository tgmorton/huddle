2. We want to outcondition our opponents. We try to beat teams in the second half or fourth quarter. We always want to be in better condition than the other team. It is not only physical condition, it is mental condition. We define mental toughness as the ability to maintain physical toughness for a long period of time. If you are only physical for one quarter, you will not win. If you are physical for four quarters, then you are mentally tough.

3. We want to generate emotion. These are kids. Get them to love each other. Sell them on being a family. We tell them to back their football family.

4. We expect total commitment from everyone associated with the program. We do not want people on the side talking crap about us. If someone has a problem, they need to come and talk to us.

We do not tolerate any excuses from anyone. We tell the kids not to listen to parents, friends, or others that don't know crap about football. We run the team. Listen only to the coaches.

At Campbell High School we develop athletes three ways:

1. Academically. We preach self-discipline, responsibility, self-motivation, and accountability. We tell kids to do the right things. They must go to class, make good grades, etc. However, we are not going to hold their hands to class. We provide guidance and study halls and any help they need, but they have to ask for it. We cannot bail them out for the rest of their life. We do not treat them any differently from the rest of the student body.

2. Socially. We stress being a good person. Be polite and respectful of others. Respect your family and teachers. Don't cheat or lie or do anything to embarrass the school, your family, the coaches, or your teammates. Pride is doing the right thing when nobody is watching.

3. Athletically. We stress being the best you can be. Not everyone has natural talent, but if you work hard and build upon what you have, you will be successful. A strong work ethic will carry over into other areas of life. Go all out, or get the hell out! The three stripes of a Campbell Saber are pride, poise, and courage.

You need money to buy a lot of different things for the football team. There are a lot of hidden costs involved with a football team. Our A.D. buys us jerseys and other equipment, but we still have to raise money. At Campbell we have a booster organization called the Sabers Football Club. The head coach has to be ultimately responsible for everything. The buck stops with you. You can have booster members, including parents, friends, or wives, but you do not turn over the program and let the parents run things. They will turn it into a monster. Make it clear that the are working under the head coach. There are a lot of areas in which booster clubs can help. This is how they help us.

The spring game has been dropped because of the High School Athletic Association. We used to make $2000 just from the spring game. We are thinking about having a passing league spring game. We may just ask them to donate a dollar at the game.

We have the kickoff night just before we start the three-a-day practices. We invite all of the parents, and we feed them. We show the highlight video from the year before. We talk about all of the forms they have to fill out. We try to get them pumped up by talking
