One neglected area of offensive football is 
cadence. I 
don't think any of us change up enough. I have charted it. I have had a GA in charge of it. I think that as offensive coaches we get into a rut. I am willing to bet that 95 percent of the people in this room, myself included, do not use the cadence to our advantage. The thing in college football today is pressure defense. With all the pressure defenses we are seeing, for our offensive football team not to change the cadence is not smart. The problem is when you decide to try to change your cadence. You go out to practice, and your kids are jumping offside every time you try to change. You yell at the kids, get frustrated, and stop trying to do it. You have to make a commitment to it. We try to commit to it every year, get frustrated, and stop. Each year the point keeps getting pushed back further.

Our coaches are visiting other programs this week. We have coaches going to Florida State. We have some in Indianapolis to visit the Colts organization. There are some at North Carolina. All our coaches at LSU are out visiting this weekend. They will all come back with a million ideas. They all will want to put something in. I won't let them put anything in until they take something out. You can't keep adding on to football. It is not fair to the kids. We don't have them all day long. If you follow the rule, you only have 17 hours a week. You have to count three hours for the game. It all has to do with time. If you go to a pro camp, they all have the great big packages. They also have the kids all day long. We don't have that. I give our coaches a free rein. If they want to add something, they have to take something out.

In our staff agenda, which we started in July, one coach is responsible for the opponent's cadence. I assign a coachand it doesn't have to be a defensive coachto come up with our opponent's cadence. We are not allowed to live-scout any more, but I still want to know that cadence. I have a list of our opponents up on the wall. I put the name of one of our assistants next to each team. I don't care how they get it. I know the rules, but come that assistant's week, he better have the cadence, or he better make something up and hope I don't know it. When you play the same teams year in and year out, you make notes on the cadence. That is part of the way to get prepared on defense. The next thing is tackling drills. We practice tackling every day. I remember listening to Bo Schembechler when I was an assistant coach. He told the story about this defensive coordinator who was delivering a lecture on defense. He had the more up-to-date coverages, knew all the buzzwords about defense, and really looked the role. At the end of his presentation, a guy in the back asked a question. He said that he was impressed by the presentation but noticed that his team was last in the conference on defense. His comment was that they just couldn't tackle. Well that is defense. Defense is about tackling. If we don't have time to practice tackling, we have too big a game plan.

Let me cover the kicking game very quickly. Your approach to the kicking game is very important. There is a principle in leadership called 
ownership. 
I think that head coaches are the owners, and assistant coaches are the renters. I remember when I rented an apartment when I couldn't afford a house. If I put a dent in the wall, all I did was pay a $10 damage fee. When I bought my first house, if someone brushed against the wall, I went bananas because I owned the house. Who owns and who cares about the kicking game? High-profile, well-paid assistant coaches put their names on offenses and defenses. But who the hell owns the kicking game? I don't believe you just go out there and coach the kicker. Someone has to own the team. They have to be responsible for that team. It could be a special-teams coach. Ownership brings more accountability.

In the fall I give every assistant a sheet that details his total responsibility to the team. Every guy on the staff knows every responsibility he has. If a coach is responsible for the field equipment, I don't want any surprises come practice time.

I am in charge of squad letters. If you don't write letters to your squad, you're missing a chance to motivate. I write a letter a week to our team, and I write a personal note on the bottom of that letter. I have our coaches write once a week to our kids. I get a copy of that letter before it goes out. When our players get home, they have a letter from me and one from an assistant coach. I give my coaches the right
