The Mike linebacker always has the second back out to a side. If both backs flow strong or weak, the Mike linebacker has the second back. If both backs flow weak, the Will linebacker has the first back. The Mike linebacker has the second back. The Sam linebacker becomes what I call the rat. That comes from a rat in a hole. He is the middle player, waiting to cut anything that comes into the middle. The strong safety has the tight end. If the tight end runs a drag across the field, he runs into the rat, who picks him up. The strong safety becomes the rat. That gives us a free guy in the hole both short and deep. We are playing 4 on 3 with all the receivers leveraged off.

If the offense runs a flow or play-action pass to the strong side, the Sam linebacker has the first back out of the backfield. The Mike linebacker has the second back. The strong safety has the tight end. The Will linebacker is the rat. If the tight end runs the drag, the Will linebacker cuts him. The strong safety becomes the rat and could get under the dig route of the split end.

Whoever the free guy is out of the four becomes the rat and cuts off the receivers. The only time the safety gets cut is when the tight end goes across. If the tight end goes vertical, the safety plays outside and the low shoulder. The safety in the sky-force position never has to cover the tight end on an inside move.

Because you are playing 4 on 3, no one is in a run-pass conflict. Everyone can play their gap responsibility on a run and still play pass responsibility without a problem.

Here is a way to work things into your package. Anytime that the safety takes the tight end and the tight end side-breaks, we call that cover one. We could call 0, which means 5 guys rushing with no rat in the hole.

If we call cover nine, the Will linebacker would have the tight end, and the safety would come down weak. It is all the same principle of coverage. What we don't want to happen is to have a linebacker covering a speedster out of the backfield. The strong safety aligns to the split end and has split-end-side breaks. The free safety is in the middle deep but has tight-endside breaks. That gives us a safety playing that speedster out of the backfield instead of a linebacker. If the free safety takes a tight-end-side break, the strong safety rotates to the middle and becomes the middle-of-the-field safety. The three linebackers play the remaining back and the tight end. That leaves us a rat short in the middle.
