defender. We could go to two tight ends and get the same results. We are going to use motion, alignment, or formation to handle the fourth defender. We are not going to let the defense dictate to us what we have to do. If we didn't do any of that, we would run the other way.

Last year we didn't have the big, blocking fullback we've had in the past. But you don't have to pancake a linebacker to have an effective block. If the fullback can get a stand off, stay on his feet, and keep them moving, we can live with that block. If he can keep his man from making the tackle, that is fine with us.

The other power play we are going to run is the old double-down and kick-out. If you have a defensive end who is thinking about stopping the quarterback by rushing upfield, we will run a lot of this play. If our fullback can block your end, you can bet on seeing this one. We can get in two tight ends and run it both ways. We have two big, physical tight ends at Ohio State. They are 6'6" and 265 and 250 pounds. We are going to make the small linebacker defend the running game. They had better be able to get off a block. We run our gap scheme on this play. We block down with everyone on the play side. The backside guard pulls into the hole, and the tailback runs off tackle. This play is our 4647.

We coach our defensive ends to cross-arm or wrong-shoulder the kick-out block and make the ball bounce. That is the way just about everyone is playing this type of play. We are getting our ends into 6 and sometimes 7 techniques to keep from getting vertical holes in our defense. That is why this play is hard to run. We run it in passing situations, because we think your defensive end may be thinking about getting upfield to sack the quarterback. If you stop the play, we get the punting team on the field, kick the ball, and play great defense.

Too many times we have too many guys coaching the point of attack. I want guys blocking away from the point of attack. To me those are the important blocks. We want to work on those backside blocks so that plays can break for long gainers. We don't want the single or double. We want a home run.

OK, guys, I think that's it. Does anybody have any questions? We have spring practice in April. We don't have any secrets. Our salvation is you, the high school coaches. Any time we can help you in any way, let us know. Come on up and see us any time. Thanks a lot.
