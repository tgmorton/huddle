We want a running lane inside. When the tailback hears the tackle-technique call, he knows he is going inside. He has to feel the blocks of the linemen and run to daylight. We don't want him running the ball outside to the tight side. A tailback can't start downhill with his pads square to the line and beat a leverage player to the outside. The fullback climbs the Sam linebacker. He takes him down the middle, not to the side. We are not thinking inside or outside with his block. We don't want an edge player.

The fullback fires through the hole. When he gets 2 to 3 yards from the linebacker, he widens his base from a staggered run to short steps. He becomes an offensive lineman. He gets his shoulder pads down on his knee, with his cage up. We hit with the face mask and shoulder pads up. He brings his hands up and tries to lift the linebacker out of his shoes. He hits him as hard as he can, accelerates his feet, and drives him off the ball. If the Sam linebacker is sticking his nose in there and making it tough on us, we fake the ball in there and throw the pass behind him.

The center and tight-guard block make the combination block on the noseguard and Mike linebacker. The tight guard blocks down on the noseguard with the center. The center comes off for the Mike linebacker. The split guard and tackle show their pads on the line of scrimmage. Hopefully, they get a pass rush from the 3 and 5 technique. They engage and drive them past the ball.

The split end drives hard on the corner and blocks him. The flanker does the same thing.

Against the 4-3 defense, this is an outstanding play. As Coach Bowden says, you can blind-call the sweep. We want to limit our running game. We are very sophisticated in the passing game. But we are as simple as we can be in the running game. We are going to have a lot of passes. That does not mean we deemphasize the running game. It only means that we have more people involved. We want to simplify the running game to the point where the linemen and backs are doing a few things but doing them well. The tight end shows his pads and tries to force the defensive end wide or downfield.

The tight tackle and guard come hip to hip and roadgrade the 3 or 4-eye technique back into the Mike linebacker. They work a combination for the 3 technique and Mike linebacker. The center and the split guard are doing the same thing with the 1 or 2-eye technique. They combination-block for the tackle and Will linebacker. The split tackle sets and works the 5 technique upfield.

This is where the play changes in the 4-3 defense. The difference is the hardball play by the four inside people. There is no pass set. We set on the outside and drive off on the inside. It is a defensive recognition for us and a technique change for the four inside people. That is something we evolved to. It became a better play when we did it.

The fullback isolates on the Sam linebacker. We tell the fullback to block him on his side of the football. We do not want to block him on our side of the football.

We have eight people making the sprint-draw pass look like the sprint draw. If the defense wants to get their safeties involved with run support, we'll beat them with the sprint-draw pass. If the defense commits safeties to run support, the wide receivers are in man coverage. What else could you want in the passing game?
