not have it. Coach Osborne has a theme for the week. One week it may be character. He will have posted some quotes from famous people that the players will recognize. Every time we have a team meeting that week, he will talk about the theme for the week. He will start the meeting off by talking about that theme. That is what he starts out talking about that week in all of our team meetings. He starts addressing a lot of issues that are going to be important to your players, now and later, after they are out of the university. He stresses the cohesiveness of the team throughout the year. We have been tested. The last couple of years, we have been tested. We have had a few players get into some trouble. Men, let me tell you, if you have any of your football players get into trouble, it goes coast to coast in a flash. So, our unity and togetherness were tested a great deal the last two years. By addressing the issues, talking about them with your players, and telling them how you expect to operate, I think you have a chance to be successful.

Now I want to talk about the drills that we use with our running backs. These drills have been used over the years. We do not change our drills just because our players get bored. I bore my players to death with the drills we use. We have a very select number of drills that we use, but we get a tremendous number of repetitions on them in practice. Basically, we get daily repetitions on them. I think you can see the carryover value in the games by doing the drills daily. On each drill that I cover, I will show it on videotape, and I will show it to you used in a game film. You will see everything we do drill-wise. Also, I will go over our techniques as far as carrying the ball. I will cover the drills that we use in dealing with one man and the drills that we use when we are dealing with more than one man. Hopefully, I will have time to go over our blocking techniques.

I believe drills are designed for a couple of purposes. One, the drill should fit into what you are doing offensively. They should fit the type of plays you are going to run. I will show you a drill that helped us a great deal on the inside zone play. Another reason for drills is to develop some confidence in your backs about going into contact.

A lot of the players who come to us are ready for contact. They will run into anyone without hesitation. There are some who are not really sure, and they are not confident about the contact phase of the game. We do a lot of close-quarters, one-on-one type of drills. We do these drills at a fairly fast pace, and I feel that the repetitions will help build their confidence in going into contact.

If you are the tailback in our system, you are going to get the ball 25 to 30 times out of the 80 snaps we will have on offense. We can't have that back having any doubt about how he is going to operate in a game. We cannot have a timid player out there carrying the football. There has to be an attitude that is formed. There has to be an attitude that is developed within your backs. There are no collisions like the ones running backs have in football. This is where you get the major collisions. The linemen have collisions from two to three yards apart. But the running backs are going to have major collisions with defenders who have angles on them and are running full speed. There are no collisions like the ones they have. They must develop an attitude that they can perform at a high level. They have to be able to do it game after game and, basically, play after play.

We are trying to develop an attitude and a skill in the drills that we perform. We have a warm-up period at the start of practice. All of our players are out there. They go through a series of things in a 10-yard area. The do the high knees, carioca, and some other warmup-type drills. Then they do some partner stretching drills. After that, all of our players break up into group work.

All of the running backs know to come to the corner of the end zone with me. When they come over, they all grab a ball. Let me talk about that first. They all have a ball in their hands. We have them go over bags with a ball in their hands. The reason I do this is that if they are going to play for us, they are going to carry the ball a lot in the game. If the ball hits the ground, our chances of winning are not very good. I want our running backs thinking good ball technique right at the start of practice.
