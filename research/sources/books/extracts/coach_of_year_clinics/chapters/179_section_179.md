rotation or three-deep zone with weak rotation, the principles of every position remain the same. Whether we teach man-free cover one with the safety down strong or man-free cover nine with the safety down weak, the principles stay the same. The whole concept of this coverage depends on the area played by the free safety. We feel that a free safety can cover about 35 yards deep and 5 yards outside either hash mark when it is in the middle of the field. For everybody on the defensive field to use the safety's help, they must reroute, funnel, and play leverage on receivers relative to the middle-of-the-field safety.

This coverage starts with the corners. The college football field is a little different from the high school field. The hash marks are 19 yards from the sideline and 13.5 yards apart. The yard line numbers are 7 yards to the bottom and 9 yards to the top from the sideline.

Ten yards from the sideline with the ball in the middle of the field is what I call a divider for the corner. If the receiver is inside the divider of the corner, the corner plays an outside alignment. That is because the safety is in the middle of the field and is relatively close for the post cut of the receiver. If the receiver aligns outside the corner's divider, the corner aligns inside, because the relative distance to the safety where he helps the corner has increased.

The divider determines whether the corner plays inside or outside the receiver. We tell him to play inside or outside relative to the divider. The divider is a plane that runs all the way down the field. If the receiver lines up inside the divider but stems the corner to a position outside the divider, the corner goes from an outside position on the receiver to an inside one.

We tell our safety that if the ball is thrown 25 yards, he should be able to break that far. We teach a little different theory with zone and man coverage.

In three-deep zone, the free safety has to stay as deep as the deeper receiver. When we play man, we settle the free safety at 25 yards. We feel that the one thing that can hurt us is running the post and the dig. If they throw to the dig receiver, there can be no one there unless the corner plays a perfect coverage. The safety needs to jump everything in the middle of the field.

Here is the second concept I want to show you. In a three-deep zone or a middle-of-the-field safety coverage, there are areas on the field that you don't want people to run in. Those areas are the seams of the zone. For the high school field, the seam is 17 yards from the sideline and 3 yards wide. The seam starts at 14 yards from the sideline and ends at 17 yards from the sideline. If you let receivers run down those seams, the safety can't cover those areas. You have to keep people out of those areas if you are playing middle-ofthe-field coverage.

When we play a three-deep zone, someone always drops to the seam and reroutes the receivers out of the seams at 10 yards. If we reroute the receiver at 5 yards, he can run past the defender and get back into the seam. If we reroute him at 10 yards, it is late in the play, and he doesn't have enough time to get back on the seam before he is too deep.

The same thing is true of cover two. We reroute receivers at 10 yards out or in to the seam. The seam in a cover two is the half-defender divider. That creates a leverage field position for the half-field safety. With the three-deep zone, we want the receivers out of the seams, and with two-deep, we want them in the seams.
