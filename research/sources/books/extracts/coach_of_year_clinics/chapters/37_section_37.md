thing. This time they pick the ball up and follow through. Everything is from the waist up.

Next, we stand up and put the throwing foot forward. If you are right-handed, we want to put the right foot forward. We have them pick the ball up and do the same as before. It is still from the waist up. We do not want them to use their legs yet. We want them to come to the top of the circle and stop. We want them to come over the top.

Let me bring you up to date at this point. There are five points in the release, and I gave you four drills to improve the release. There are other drills you can do. I have a lot of drills to use on this technique. I give our kids only five or six and have them work on those.

Next is 
footwork. 
Now we talk about the quarterback from the waist down. We are assuming your kids will soak all of that in so it becomes a habit with them. They must be able to do the drills naturally. Now footwork. We do what we call 
quarterback agilities. I 
have talked to the best quarterback coaches in the country. When I go to clinics, I look for different ideas. I pick the minds of the people I come in contact with. I want to know everything I can about quarterbacks. I share this with our kids, and I am sure it helps our kids. Paul Hackett will tell you that no matter what, footwork is the most important thing in being a quarterback. If your feet are not in the right position, you are not going to throw the ball properly. He is correct. Some kids have strong arms and throw the ball improperly, but they get away with it on the high school level. When you get up against a good team, they are not going to get away with it. It is just like a boxer. He can throw a good punch if he has a good stance. If you are a quarterback, you can throw a good pass if you are in a good stance and your feet are in the proper position. When quarterbacks are under pressure, they never get in the right throwing position. This is where footwork comes into play.

Here are some of the things we teach our kids. We work hard on this. Let me have our GAs come down here to demonstrate again. The first thing I want our quarterbacks to do is to learn how to run. A lot of kids do not know how to run as quarterbacks. We talk about an armpit-to-armpit motion. We run down the field in about three-quarters speed. As we come down the field, I want the ball to come from one armpit across to the other armpit. We want them to come out nice and easy and transfer the ball back and forth. We want the ball up to the chin. Some players will get a little stiff when they run this drill. We do not want too much sway in the motion. It should just come naturally. It is a natural motion armpit to armpit.

The next thing we teach them is run backward, looking over the nonthrowing shoulder. If they are right handed, they should look over the left shoulder. They are just going to run back, taking a crossover step. As they do this, their eyes are focusing down the field. We want them to run as fast as they can. We do not do the carioca. We do that later. We just want to run backward. Why run that drill? That is a quarterback agility. Some kids cannot turn their head around and move their legs at the same time. It is side vision. This is how I work on the drill. I want the quarterback to see from sideline to sideline. We have them put the chin down so they can see to both sides. Some players cannot put their chin down and run backward. You are coordinating all things together. If you start with the kids in the 7th and 8th grade, you can develop them to do this drill. If you want to develop a quarterback, work on this drill. Don't just tell the kid he is the quarterback and let him go on his own. Work with him. You have to work with them.

After he learns to run backward with his chin down, we have him turn the chin over his shoulder and run backwards. Then we have him turn the chin to the opposite shoulder. Next we work on going back and switching the chin from one side to the other side. As they come backward, I will yell, "switch." They turn from the right side to the left side. They turn the chin and switch. As they are doing this, I want the ball in the trigger position. I want the chin tucked and the head on a swivel. The head stays the same, men. The head stays the same. Now, we do not have a lot of room here, so I will have the GAs switch very fast. [Demo] They must be able to move. They are developing hip flexibility as they switch from one side to the other side. You cannot play football with your butt hole puckered up. You have to be cool and calm.
