early, that gives another one a chance to play. Those young players will play about as well as you expect them to play.

In our league we think that you have to be able to run the football and defensively you have to stop the other team from running the ball against you. There are a lot of good coaches in the Big Ten. If you can only run the ball, everyone will play you in a nine-man front. If all you can do is throw the ball, they will play you in nothing but a nickel package and take away what you can do. I think the game of football is being coached better now than at any other time. Now you have to be multiple. You better be able to run the ball and throw it. You have to do both. At our place we want to be about 60 percent to 40 percent run-to-pass. We have good balance in our offense.

You have to play great defense. Two of my very best defensive coaches are lecturing here later on this afternoon. I would advise you to go listen to them if you want to know what we are doing defensively. Last year we had a great defensive football team. We gave up an average of 10 points a game, and we play a great schedule. You win with defense. To have a good defensive football team, you have to commit good personnel to that side of the ball. You don't suddenly decide that you are going to play good defense. At our place our best players play on the defensive side of the ball.

We recruit linemen who can run. If they can run at all, we are going to give them a chance to play defense. If they can't play defense, we move them over to the offense. We take the good athletes and put them on defense. Shawn Springs could have been a great wide receiver or running back. But he was a great corner. What you are going to see in our league is the corners playing man-to-man and everyone else stopping the run. That is why you must run the ball and throw it. You have to use a lot of different formations and utilize the strengths of your football team.

At our place you have to win. I found that out at the first Buckeye booster meeting I went to. They assured me that they were 100 percent behind me, win or tie. 3ut they said, "Don't tie too many." I went down to buy a house. I talked to the real estate lady. She asked me what I did for a living. I told her I was the new football coach at Ohio State. She said I should rent this first year. We had an awful football team my first year. I made a mistake. I went in and talked about rebuilding and that we do not have any talent. Well, that is the way we played.

I don't brag a lot or lure players on the field. But I spend a lot of time in the locker room and weight room telling our young players how good I think they are going to be next year. We expect to have a hell of a football team next year, although we lost eight defensive players. We lost six offensive starters, but we expect to have a hell of a team. The Buckeyes are going to be good again next year. I tell that to our players all the time. Nobody is going to outwork us. Nobody is going to coach better than we coach. Nobody is going to work harder in the winter program.

We have a sign in our locker room and in our big meeting room. This is what we hang our hats on: 
Nothing keeps us from winning. 
I don't want to hear any reason why in the hell we don't win. I don't want to hear about lack of speed, size, or talent; inexperience; or anything else. I don't want to hear about injuries or the pregame meal. Don't talk about the officials or bad calls. In my opinion all you do when you talk about those things is to give yourself some reason why you got your butt beat. We don't do that. I don't care what it is. I don't want to hear about it. Just get the job done. I heard Joe Paterno one year, and he said he didn't believe in signs, but if he did, it would be, "Don't bitch about your players, because they are the only ones you've got." You can't trade them or draft some more. You better take the players you have coming back and make them into winners. That is the attitude we have.

Quickly let me show you some things that we hang our hat on. These are not original. They are called the 10 commandments. Tennessee uses them now, and Alabama used to use them.

(1) The team that makes the fewest mistakes usually wins the game. We don't make many mistakes. We don't turn the ball over much. We are not going to make a lot of stupid penalties.
