Anyone in this room could coach on the college level if given the opportunity. However, your commitment to high school coaching is a blessing for these kids.

At Oklahoma I had to put together a staff and start to build a program from one that has been down. Oklahoma has great tradition. To build back that tradition, you have to start with staff development. When you put together your staff, you have to have a number of things present within the people you hire. They must be committed to the things you are. They must be loyal to you and the school. They have to be accountable for their work. The players are looking to the coaches for examples. How can we tell a kid not to smoke when we smoke? Those kids are looking at us and mimicking us. What do you want to be remembered for? Do you want to be remembered as someone who influenced the lives of their kids or someone who just won games? I want to be remembered for making a difference in these kids' lives.

Today in college football we have to emphasize academics. Academics will be the number-one priority at Oklahoma. We have an academic support system which sets up study halls, monitors class attendance, and grades. If a kid assigned to that study hall misses, he reports to the stadium at 5:30 in the morning. He has to run. We are going to focus on the direction these kids go.

I put together an outstanding staff with a lot of high morals and values. I got one of John Cooper's coordinators, Bill Young, who had been with him 18 years. He took the same job at Oklahoma. He saw the direction our program was going.

You must have loyalty within your staff. If you don't, it will turn your program inside out. Most programs and jobs are lost because someone from inside the program destroyed it. If you have a situation where one of your assistants has a friend who doesn't like the way you un your program, that is not disloyalty. But if that friend starts to talk about the program and his boss and the assistant won't defend the program, that is disloyalty.

I'm going to talk about the 4-3 defense in just a minute. We'll talk about the alignments, linebacker play, and coverages. That is the type of football you want to hear. Just remember guys, it is not what you run, but who is running it on the field. It is the talent and not the scheme that wins. It is developing the talent with the proper thinking that wins games. Discipline and commitment are tremendously important. Kids have to believe that you care about them and love them. We had a team this year that wasn't that good, but they never gave up. We played 60 minutes of football even when the game was out of reach. That was because our kids knew that we cared about them. These kids were loyal and would fight to get the job done for the coaches. They all know how to line up and play football. That is why you have to reach them to get them to play to the highest level they can. That goes for pros as well as college.

We played a 50 defense at Oklahoma for 12 years. When we went to the Cowboys, we went to the 4-3 defense. At Oklahoma when I was playing, we played the 4-3 in a nickel situation. But for the most part, teams in the Big Eight ran the football. They did not throw the ball all that much. But today the 4-3 defense allows you to balance across the front and secondary. The 4-3 defense is an attacking defense. We teach our guys to attack and react. We get as close to the ball as we can and come off the ball. In our alignment we want the inside hand down. The inside hand is the one closest to the ball. We want our inside leg back. The reason for that is to squeeze the play and not get turned out. That is the hardest technique to play. As the defensive lineman steps with his inside foot, he is creating power in his punch hand where he can squeeze the slip block. The guard is trying to butt up and slip to the backside linebacker. By using that type of charge, the defensive tackle can defeat the reach, squeeze, and slip and maintain control of the B gap.

In a 4-3 defense if you bring a defensive tackle into a 2 technique on the guard, make sure he has A gap responsibility. That way you keep your linebacker clean.

Let's talk about alignment. The end to the 5 technique side is inside ear hole to outside ear hole of the
