young players. The seniors have four years of work capacity from the training program, and they know what to expect. The freshmen have never done the program before.

What we have found in our training is this. The foundation of all of our training is our work capacity and our fitness. This is also what the eastern groups believe. The more fit you are, the more work you can do. The more work you can do, the more quality work you can do. The more quality work you can do, the better you can be. This is true, even if it is only 2 percent per day. If it is 2 percent every day, then you are going to be better than the other guy.

Fitness is the basis of our program. It is the cornerstone of our program. That is what we work on first. You must have great fitness. It does not matter if it is weight fitness, conditioning fitness, running fitness, jumping fitness, speed fitness, or anything else. We are going to approach it from a standpoint of fitness first. After fitness comes strength, power, and then speed. Those are the three parts of our program from a weight-lifting type of program.

In our program, there are three more things involved. They are part of our cornerstone. We are going to train hard. We are going to take care of that in the weight room and with agilities. The coaches will take care of that on the football field.

We must eat right. Most of us are getting older. If you are like me, you have a problem buying clothes. Instead of buying clothes a little longer, we have to buy them wider. There are not enough hours in a day, if you do not eat right, to work it off or to work through it. You must eat right.

We must have rest to recover. That is a problem now. When we used to have athletic dorms, we could control what they ate and when they rested, and you could control the breakfast check as to when they got up. You can't do that anymore. Today, kids think that they can train really hard on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and then go out and go hard on Friday and Saturday nights. That does not work well on your body. The key is train right, eat right, and rest to recover. That is one thing that Michael Johnson does in his program. It makes a difference over the other athletes. When he was in high school, the best he ever finished was third in the state. He got into college 10 years ago, started training, and liked the program. He got into track and really liked what he was doing. Now he will not miss a workout. I bet he has not missed 50 workouts in the last 10 years.

Now, all of this is a nice theory. How do you apply it? Here is how we apply it. When we are training our people, we can do this. When we are lifting light weights, we can lift them very, very fast. It is like a snatch, clean, or jump. It is very fast. It is body weight. Next we go to power. Now there is more resistance, and we have to use more strength and movement. It is like a power clean or a jerk, or it could be a jump and holding a weight of some kind.

Next, we get into strength movements. They are very, very heavy and very slow. You have to train all up and down the continuum. When you first start out training when you are in high school and you start lifting heavy weights, you get better at everything. This includes speed, strength, and power. That is because you are not very strong. But after you have been lifting heavy weights for a few years, you do not learn as fast. You do not jump as fast because you spend too much time training at one end of the continuum.

You can see the speed of movement at the one end is very fast. Also, it is very long. It comes with long movement.

The next movement is more medium, and it is quick. It is like a clean. It is heavier, and the movement is not as long. It is a quicker movement.
