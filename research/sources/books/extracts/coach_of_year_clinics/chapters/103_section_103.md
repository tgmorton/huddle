Defensive End Techniques

University of Louisville

It is a pleasure to be here. I feel fortunate to be at a school such as the University of Louisville. It is an honor to coach for Ron Cooper. Ron is a good coach and a good person. I think he has a tremendous staff and support system. We have a training room that is great. I can't say enough about the job Ray Ganong does with our players in the weight program. I think we had a good season last year, and a lot of credit goes to what they were doing in the weight room with our players. If you get a chance to stop by our weight room, make sure you visit with Ray Ganong and his staff. They really do a good job with our off-season program.

First, I want to go over our defensive staff with you. Our defensive coordinator is Everett Withers, and he coaches the secondary. Rock Roggeman coaches the defensive tackles. Sal Sunseri coaches the linebackers. I coach the defensive ends. Together we have all been able to put our thoughts and ideas into the defense. We all bring something different to the table. I think that has helped us overall as a defense.

I have a few stats on how our defense did this past season. The Cardinal defense has been ranked among the top 25 nationally in scoring defense in each of the past two seasons, including a number seven finish in 1995. In the last 22 games, the defense has allowed an average of 16.8 points per game. This past season, our defense held opponents to an average of 235.8 yards per game, good for fifth among NCAA Division I teams. Actually, after the bowl games we were fourth. First in defense was Florida State, then North Carolina, Virginia, and then Louisville.

We held opponents to 96.7 yards per game in passefficiency defense to finish 13th overall on defense. We do stress stopping the run at Louisville. We talk each day about how to stop the run. We stress this to our kids, and we have been successful in doing that. We allowed opponents an average of 81.1 yards per game on the ground to finish fourth nationally. Senior Sam Madison, our defensive back, received first team All-American honors. He has a great chance to be drafted as a number one pick in the NFL. He had six interceptions in 1996. Another defensive leader for us was linebacker Tyrus McCloud. He had 144 tackles in 1996, and he too has a great shot at the NFL.

Our defense had a school-record 45 sacks in 1996. Senior defensive end Carl Powell had 11. Seven of the sacks came in a two-week period against Memphis and North Carolina. I will talk about some of the defensive techniques he used to get those sacks.

Next I want to share with you our defensive goals for the year. What do you want to do to be successful? We keep the goals on a chart and keep them updated after each game. This is what we wanted to achieve in 1996.
