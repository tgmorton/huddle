Concentration and Finish

University of Hawaii

There is one thing Blaine Gaison failed to mention in the introduction. If we do not get our ass moving in the right direction, we will be looking for a new job soon. I appreciate your supporting the Nike Clinic. It always amazes me that football coaches would be here this late to hear a lecture. It is after 9 P.M., and we still have a good crowd remaining in place to listen to a 210 coach. The coach is up here because he is trying to pay a debt back to Nike for shoes for the team. It amazes me that you would sit in here this late. We have locked the doors, so you can't leave if you wanted to anyway.

Frank Solich of Nebraska just spoke. I listened to his lecture. I have been on the other end of five Cornhuskers games, and I can assure you that they knock your ass down. Frank said they don't run over people, but they do.

One thing that amazes me is that you guys will pay your money to come to a clinic, come from a neighbor island, or drive across the state to come to listen to someone lecture on football just to improve your vocation. That is unique to this business. It makes you unique. You are listening to a 2-10 coach speak at this time of night. I appreciate the opportunity to swap ideas about football with you. I appreciate your participating in this clinic and in a game that is very special to all of us. It is a time in our society where we represent the last bastion of discipline in that society in many respects. If we do not kick them in the rear and straighten them out and give them some direction, I do not know who in the schools are going to in this day and age. Looming litigation keeps the school administrators from doing it, and classroom teachers will not do it, so coaches are the last hope. If you are not setting the example in private and public schools, I do not know who is going to. Young people need more guidance and direction today than they ever needed. The challenges in coaching are greater than they have ever been before. That is because young people today are being reared differently. There are a lot of temptations out there today. There are things other than football for them to do.

Football is a difficult sport to play in that it is not a natural thing. Practicing football is not always pleasant. There is a lot of tedium and monotony in it. It challenges us to stay on top of the game and to give them plenty of guidance and direction.

I am going to talk about the role of concentration and finish. We have to get it right because my contract is running out soon.

This husband and wife went out on the golf course to play a round of golf. He had to hit from the back tee each time, and she would tee off from the ladies tee that was closer. On the fourth hole, he teed his Titlist ball up, and-bang!-he hits his wife right in the head. Mrs. Liebusch goes down, and she does not get up. He calls the EMS, and a doctor came and pronounced her dead right there. He felt horrible about what had happened. They decided that they would have to do an autopsy. They did the autopsy and called Mr. Liebusch up to discuss the autopsy. This is what the doctors said: "Mr. Liebusch, we found out that when the Titlist golf ball struck your wife in the head, she sustained a skull fracture. As a result of it, she died. However, the puzzling part of this whole thing is that we found a Dunlop golf ball in her anus." Mr. Liebusch said, "That is not very puzzling to me. That was my Mulligan."

I want to talk to you about our approach to our philosophy, administration, and organization. Before we can get anything done in football, we feel we must be able to capture our players' concentration and give them a concept of finish. So much of what we do requires that we have total concentration by our players. How do you do that? How do you build a concept of finish? Everyone knows that you have to
