VS. 4-3 WITH TWO 2 TECHNIQUES

We do run the tackle trap to the tight end some of the time. Primarily, we run it to an open side. We still use the same rules. If the man is not on the line, the guard will trap the linebacker. Here it is against the 50 front to the tight-end side.

TRAP OPTION TO TIGHT END VS. 50 FRONT

What I would like to do here now is to show you the video of the plays I just covered. I appreciate your attendance. I will be around the rest of the evening, and I will be glad to visit with you and talk about our program. Thank you.
