to put a man in the middle and a man in each outside zone. That is where they are going to stay. They stay in that area of the field. If we want to play a two-deep zone, we will set those corners outside of the wideouts, and that is where they are going to stay. If we are anticipating short passes on 3rd and 15, we may drop our linebackers back to certain spots on the field. We have a limited rush and five certain people in areas of the field, and we still have three deep.

3. Receivers do not know where the lick is coming from. 

Receivers love man-to-man coverage. When the defender gets up tight on the receiver, that receiver can't wait to run his pattern. Do you know why? Because he knows who is going to hit him. He knows where the lick is coming from. He can take the lick where he wants to take it. When that receiver comes outside and the defense scatters, he does not know who is going to hit him. That is another reason we play the zone.

4. Different zones change receivers' routes. 

The wide receiver comes outside, and all of a sudden there is a man in front of him and one behind that defender. Now he is reading two deep. Whatever was called in the huddle, they are going to convert. Now you get into the communication process between the quarterback and the wideout. The receiver has to change his route because he can't run the hook. He has a defender in that area.

If we are in a two-deep look and all of sudden we switch to a three-deep look, the receiver has to change his route again. By using different zones, we make receivers change their routes. That leads us to the next commandment.

5. Different zones change the pass patterns. 

Is it a five-short zone; is it a three-deep zone? Is it a two-deep zone? Is it a strong zone or a weak zone? The offense will have to change what they are doing, or we will be successful against them.

6. Zone coverages dictate where the ball will be thrown. 

When we line up our defenders in certain areas of the field, we take those areas away by our alignment. It is called an alignment advantage. We take away certain patterns. We want to force the offense in play selection. To be successful, they have to try to get to the flat to get some yardage. They could try to run to the seam and hope that the quarterback can drive the ball into the receiver. We want to dictate where they throw the football. In practice, we work to see whether the offense is throwing the ball where we want them to throw it. If they are not throwing the ball to the weakest part of that zone, then we are not executing the defense the way we should. You cannot let them throw the ball into the teeth of your zone. If you do that, they will beat you to death. We want to make them go the long road. We want to make the offense put the ball where we want it put.

7. Changes in zone coverages confuse the quarterback. 

Defend the pass from the eye of the quarterback or the man throwing the ball. Don't defend the pass by looking at the pass patterns from your office on the screen. Defend it from the eyes of the man throwing the football. That is why there are only five or six great quarterbacks in the NFL. There are only five or six of them who have both the eyes and the arm. Lots of them have the eyes, but they do not have the arm. A lot of them can see where the ball should go but can't get it there. On the other hand, you have some guys who have the arm and can get the ball down the field, but they can also read or determine on their drop where the ball should be placed against that defense. We look at things in college by the kind of throw the man can make. This year, we had to play against two quarterbacks who have it all: the quarterback at Florida and the quarterback at Tennessee. We did not have much success against them. We had some success against some of the other teams because their quarterbacks were not able to see the opening and then do something about it.

8. Blitz and defend with zone coverages. 

Attack the protection scheme. That is what I was telling you about in my conversation with Coach Pitts. He was not comfortable with man coverage. I showed him a couple of simple blitzes that would give the protection he was playing against problems, yet he could still be secure in what he liked, which was the three-deep secondary. I will go over this later. Anyone in the NFL that blitzes and plays zone coverages gets a big raise or a title.
