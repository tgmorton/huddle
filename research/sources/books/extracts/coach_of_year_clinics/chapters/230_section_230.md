I'm coaching linebackers now but my heart is with the defensive line. That is where you win games. We are winning football games with our defensive front-four people. The key to us is the attack front. You need the right people to do it. You can't play with a 290-pound slug in there. We have tried to recruit quicker players.

Stance is key and alignment is crucial. We don't vary from a different stance or alignment. You start where you are aligned. Never get beat by bad alignment. We never have our defensive linemen with their helmet within the framework of the offensive lineman. If the offensive line splits start to get tight, it looks like we are sitting in the gap. It doesn't look like we are shaded on anything or anybody. But that is the way we coach it. We are still lined up on the man we are shaded on.

In our stance we get down in a heel-to-toe relationship. If we want to slant, we base up a little and bring our feet closer together. The inside hand goes on the ground. That is the hand closest to the ball. We put the hand down in front of our nose and even with the back foot. We want our punch hand and first step going in the same line. We don't talk about weight distribution but we want the weight on the hand with their butt a little higher than their shoulders. When kids can't get off the ball, it is generally because they get too flat in their back. That comes from being tired also. Don't get so high that you can't see the man you are shaded on. We want our inside foot on the outside foot of the offense.

Our first step is going to be right where our hand used to be. The step ended up being about a 2-foot step. We punch through the hip of the offensive lineman. We take a thumbs-up half-closed fist and punch out nice and firm. We step down and replace our hand. This is if we are in outside techniques. We do this for pad level. High pads lose battles. If we are going to win we have to keep the pads down. When we punch the hip we literally want that offensive lineman to go home with a bruise on his hip. We use this as a feeler to get the shoulder turned to the play.

If we are playing an inside technique like the 1 and 7 technique, we crowd the ball as tight as possible. Place your outside foot on the inside foot of the lineman you are aligned on. He gets his rip arm ready. As the ball is snapped, all the linemen are thinking about is ripping his outside arm. He is not going to punch down to the tackle. That would be a 5 technique. All he is going to concentrate on is stepping and getting his outside arm through. That keeps us from getting in a "Wash. " This has been huge for us. That is the same for a 1 technique.

If we line up in an "11" defense, our tackles have their inside hand down. On their first and second step they are thinking outside arm and ripping it as hard as they can. They rip right through the ear hole of the offensive lineman. He is coming on all fours. He wants to get to the second key as quick as possible. All we have to teach is outside and inside technique with all four of them.

We only talk about six blocking schemes with these guys. The first one is the base block. He punches the hip and works upfield to get his hat in the crack. Do not get stretched, and they find the second key. It is hard to tell a base block and a zone block. In the zone look, the offensive lineman stretches for an instant.

The next one is a reach block or zone block. We step upfield with the first step and punch the hip. Make a quick second step away from the offensive lineman and explode back upfield. We want to end up 1 yard outside and 1 yard upfield. Next, we want to find the second key.

The next thing is the veer block with a cutoff. We step straight upfield and punch the hip. On the second step, we step down with the down block and rip the backside arm through the cutoff block. Look for any trapper. If we see the trapper, we wrong-arm him or
