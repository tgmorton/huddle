down right in the middle of the set. The tight end takes his inside release. He reads zone. He runs his pattern up to 6 yards and hooks outside between the two linebackers. The tight end is the primary receiver on this play. If they jump the tight end, the fullback will be wide open. This basically is the same play as the H option. We call it F option because the flanker is running the choice route.

This next play is called "62 X, Y cross." This Is What I Want we want to do against man coverage. We narrow the split of the split end to 6 or 7 yards from his tackle. The flanker takes a post move. The tight end takes an inside release and comes across at a depth of 5 to 7 yards. The split end comes underneath at a depth of 3 to 5 yards. We want the mesh or cross of our receiver in the middle of the formation. The quarterback reads the free safety. People know that is the first pattern we run against man coverage. They try to hang the weak safety in the cross area and rob the ball. They are taking a gamble by putting their other corner on an island with the flanker. The weak safety hanging in the middle gives the flanker the entire field to work with man coverage. When the quarterback sees the free safety hang in on the cross, he goes downtown to the flanker. Most of the time we win that battle. That is where we work our option route to the flanker. We can give him a post-corner.

There are a number of different ways to run the same play. One way I like to do it is bring the flanker in motion. The split end runs the post route, and the flanker and tight end run the cross. The read is the same. We can set the halfback in the weak slot and run the flanker on the go route. The split end does the post, and the halfback and tight end run the cross. The keys are the same, and the pattern is the same.

Basically, the guy who comes underneath catches the ball as soon as the cross takes place. The underneath receiver starts to float upfield. He doesn't continue his pattern across the field. We run this pattern with all different kinds of combinations. We can take X, Y, and Z on go routes and bring both back out and cross them in the middle.

One final thing here, and then I'll answer any questions you may have. One of the best plays against a zone defense is "all curls." From that we can get into the "Y choice." That is the option route for the tight end. Our outside receivers run a 12- to 14-yard curl route. This is not a hook pattern. As the receiver starts to make his move, he looks at the quarterback.

If there is someone between him and the quarterback, he takes it further inside. That is why it is important to align wide. A zone team will eat you up if you don't get the stretch. He doesn't come down and stop. He works back to the quarterback. We look at the middle
