Gentlemen, we are going to do everything we can to help you. We have our football camp. If you come down, our coaches will take you into a room, sit down, and give you some football time. I don't mean just lecture. We want to help you become a good football coach.

Again, your main focus has to be your kids. You have to spend time with them and direct them. You can talk X's and O's all you want or draw plays until you are blue in the face, but if you don't have the kids' minds in the right direction, it won't work. Your focus should be spending time with the kids and making sure they are doing what is right. That is what we are about at Oklahoma.

Gentlemen, if you don't have any questions, I'll close. Just remember how important you are to your players. You are a big influence on what they do. Teach them to do the right things, and I'll promise you everything else will take care of itself. I appreciate your inviting me. Thank you.
