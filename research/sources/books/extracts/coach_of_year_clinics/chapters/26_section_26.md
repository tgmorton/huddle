this on every team we play. We do this in the offseason. We get them back out in the summer and update them.

We do an evaluation of the drills we do. The criteria we use for our drills is this: They must adapt to game situations. When I played, we used a drill called the monkey roll. I am sure some of you have done the drill. Do you ever see anyone use the monkey roll in a game? We want the drill to adapt to a game situation.

Now I will talk about our offense. The best advice I can give young coaches is this: ''Be known for something.'' For us, we are known for the option and the play-action pass. We run out of the I formation. I see a lot of teams that change their offense because of the personnel they have coming back. Some years we will have the leading rusher in the state. Some years we will have the leading passer or the leading receiver. Some years we are a ball-control team. Some years we are a big-play team. But, we are always in the I set. We do something different each year, but 85 to 90 percent of our offense is the same every year.

The other thing we do is to limit the number of plays we run. When I first started coaching, we had six running plays and four passing plays, and we won the state championship. When I look back, that told me something. Bobby Bowden said if they add a play, they have to take one out of their offense first. If you are going to add one, take one out.

We really try to balance our run and pass plays. You usually are good at one or the other. If you are really good at one or the other, then you had better work on getting the worst part better. This year we had 30 TDs running and 30 TDs passing. That is balance, but it does not always work out that way.

When you look at your offense, you should evaluate your practice time spent versus how often it is used in a game. We spend a lot of time working on plays, but when we get in the game we never run them. We may run them once or twice. I am talking about your base offense.

It is important to package your plays to get the most out of them. We start out with a base play. Then we have an extension and a misdirection out of the play. Next, we have play-action passes. Finally, we have our special plays.

We work hard on our execution and situations. When I said we go against the bags, it does not mean we are not working. We used to go out and scrimmage in the middle of the field. Not any more. Now we work on situations such as goal line, coming out, 3rd and 10, and two-minute offense.

On defense it is the same thing as offense. Once you know what you are doing, you can adjust. You need to be known for something on defense. This year we saw several different formations. We saw the spread, fullhouse, run-and-shoot, pro, trips, single-wing, shotgun, and wing-T formations. Take your defense, and figure out how to adjust your defense to meet different formations. We are a 6-2 team and could adjust to those sets.

I think there are four things you need to have a great defense. It does not matter what level you are on; these still apply:

(1) Assignments and alignments. Make sure the kids know what they are doing before you play a team.
