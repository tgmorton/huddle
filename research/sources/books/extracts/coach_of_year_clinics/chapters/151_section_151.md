first in the huddle, but the only time they get to play is when we are way ahead or way behind. But he loves the game, and he loves being part of the team. He is a true Rudy. Now we give a coaches' award to this type of kid. We do not give the award every year. The kid has to be a true Rudy. Attitude of senior leadership is critical to their success.

The movie 
Rudy 
illustrates to the senior leaders the value of Rudys much better than I could. This is what we stress to our seniors. For the program to be a success, they must understand the role of Rudys. I refer to the move as a training film. (1) Attitude of senior leadership is critical to their success. (2) They need to understand the purpose and values of Rudys. (3) They should receive recognition by the first team: "Good job, Rudys." (4) Senior leadership takes part of the Rudys for the second team.

I am always positive. If we gain 1 or 2 yards, we are giving them high fives just as if we scored a touchdown. Now, I am telling them "good job" and how much fun we are having.

How do we accomplish all of this? First, we have computerized our scouting information on each team we play. If you are like most schools, you have a four-drawer file, with one or two of those drawers crammed full of scouting information. What we did was to go into those drawers and copy three years of data on a disk on each team. We copy four categories. It is a very unsophisticated system; it is strictly a storage system. We copied only four areas: our defensive game plan, your offensive tendencies, your defensive tendencies, and 10 to 12 of your offensive plays. When you put that on a computer and print it out, you come out with about 20 pages. Last year, when we played a team, we went through these four categories and put them on the computer. That becomes our current scouting report.

We do all of our scouting from videotape. We are so far from our opponents. When we go through the tapes to scout you, we prepare another game plan. We have a defensive game plan, and we identify your offensive tendencies, defensive tendencies, and your best 10 to 12 offensive plays. We compare them to what we just printed out. We put the latest report on the computer and develop a current game plan. Then everything slides down another year.

The goal is to be able to find this information fast. Before, when we went to the filing cabinet, we could never find what we were looking for. Now we know where everything is located. We print out the four categories, and we are ready to go practice.

I have found that most head coaches do not like to throw away anything. Our plan is to keep three years of data. It does not matter how many years of data we keep, we probably will not refer to it unless someone says something like this: "Didn't they run something special three years ago that we need to be aware of?" Then we can go back to the computer and look at the past scouting reports. We may not print it out, because we most likely will just look at the film of this year's team, print out the scouting report from the past year, and then create a package that we can take out on the field.

The package we take out on the field looks like this. I have each play that I want the scout team to run that day on a printout. All assignments are drawn out. That is what I take into the huddle. It takes me about five minutes to print these plays out. It does not matter whether the plays get wet, torn, dirty, or whatever, because I can duplicate them instantly on the computer.

Here is a sample of one of the scout-team plays. These play sheets are numbered and match an index card created by the defensive coordinator. I look at the films and determine some of your blocking schemes. I make sure to draw out each assignment. You must remember
