Again, the coaches are spread out so that they can see what is going on. We go back and forth and try to get as much done as possible. Again, we rotate the line every three plays and the backs every play. The quarterbacks rotate every other play. Again, we film it all.

We work on half-line blocking schemes. These are onside blocks only. We work the backside blocking during fundamentals. We go two groups side by side. I stand in the middle, and we go rapid fire. We work on the particular block we need that day. We do not have backs in the drill. We have a quarterback, and we use our snap count. We go on a quick count. We want a lot of reps here. We work all of the different individuals in the drill. We run to both sides. Then the second group goes. While one group is going, the other one is getting ready. We do not want to waste time. We work on the plays we need to go over for that day. Again, you have to work your center both ways. On one play he goes to the right, and the next play he goes to the left.

We do not flip-flop. We are right side, left side. Most people say flip-flopping is the best thing. The one thing I would be afraid on flip-flopping would be pass protection. That is the reason we do not use the flip-flop.

Next, we go to half-line pass. We want as many reps as we can get. We want to stay away from the big piles. We do not want anyone to get hurt. This is an all-pass drill. Everyone knows it is all-pass. It is a tough situation up front, and it is tough for the quarterback. It is the best drill we do as far as pass protection. We go with the right side at the top. The defense can do what they want, including using the blitz. We do not touch the quarterback on the drill. We tag the quarterback. We script all of the plays we are going to work on.

One group runs the play while the other group is getting their play in the huddle, one yard from the ball. In the game we huddle five yards from the ball. We do not waste time in practice getting from the huddle to the line. We are trying to get as many reps as possible and save as much time as we can. We are not concerned that the defense knows what we are calling. We feel that is overrated. We run the drill from the right hash, right middle, middle, left middle, and left hash. This way the quarterback gets a look at all the reads. We do not do a lot of coaching in this drill. We want reps. Our extra linemen are on a knee off to the side. We have a lot of players working here. Let's see the film.

HALF-LINE PASS DRILL: TWO GROUPS BACK TO BACK
