one man on a sled, then that man is getting the hell coached out of him. We have eight men in a line and one working. Are the men standing in line in a manner that denotes that they are maintaining concentration? Are they allowing themselves to be coached even though they are not physically taking a turn? There needs to be some methodology for how they stand in line. Do you want them in line as the military does? Do you just want to make certain that they are watching the man taking the turn? When he is being coached, they are in turn being coached. The others should learn from any mistake he makes. They should learn from anything positive he does. If you do not pay attention to their concentration and finish and its relationship to the drills, you will have eight players do different things. It is our job to home in on concentration and finish.

As soon as the player concludes with the sled, he does something to finish the drill. He doesn't just slam the sled and work his feet, you blow the whistle and tell him to stop working his feet, then he walks his happy butt back to the end of the line. The others in line are watching that event. He is not getting any finish out of that. If that happens, you have really lost the essence of what you are trying to get accomplished in the drill. In everything they do, we make a big deal that there must be a finish to it. We do not want to glide or walk away from a drill setting. What is a drill? It is a microcosm of the game. You are taking some segment of the game out, and you are working on it. I want to be certain that if I am coaching Mort on the sled, the other guys in line are paying attention to what I said. As I work Mort, I want to look at them to see whether they got the right idea. I do not want to repeat everything I said to Mort to each player.

The same thing happens in a meeting. You need to make certain that you are finishing the meeting the way you want to. Did I capture their concentration? I don't know, because I can't look inside of their heads. But if they are looking at me and it appears that they are listening, then we have a chance. That is all we ever want in this sport anyway. I have a chance to hold that man. Now, when he goes out on the field and puts that into practical application, I will see whether he learned it or not. I want to make certain that if I can only coach one or two at a time, the other guys are homed in on what we are doing. You get the point.

These are points that we can expect from one another. It needs to be clear-cut to the players what they can expect from the coaches and what we expect of them. Put it down. It can be a list of 10 things or 20 things, whatever. We reduce our list to as few as we can and then tell them that this is what we expect of them. "This is what you can expect of us."

What can the players expect from the coaches? We should be consistent. We are going to expect them to meet a certain standard of play, concentrate, and finish strong in everything we are doing. We are not going to relax that standard for a player just because he is a talented player or because we are doing something that may not seem to be important. It is all important, or we would not do it.

They must feel the difference between urgency and whatever you use to caricature your football team. You do not want a player to be a fanatic. That is not a good posture. He needs to be urgent. It means that a thing is sudden, and it is happening right now. "Let's make this thing urgent." It is an urgent proposition. It needs to be done at a certain tempo. We have prescribed the tempo, and it has to go that way. As coaches, we are not paid to be satisfied. If we won a game 75-0, we would still find something to gripe about. We are trying to play to a special standard.

We are going to give them leadership and direction. It is going to be firm, and it is going to be on our terms. It is going to be with the team orientation in mind. We want to create an open dialogue. If you have something stuck in your butt, come in, and let's talk about it. We try to find out what the problem is.

Coaches are accountable. If you pick up the paper, you will find out that we are accountable. They should expect us to have technical command of what we do. We should know what the game is about. We do not have all of the answers, but we do have a lot of them. We have to respect the player for what he is going
