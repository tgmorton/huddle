about 85 percent of the time. We want a good hardnosed fullback. The hard-nosed fullbacks are hard to find today. Some people prefer another wideout instead of the hard-nosed fullback. We like the hardnosed type of players. To me, it is what football is all about. As Buck Nystrom would say, "It is a tough game for tough people." I believe that way myself.

In our offense I would like to think we could complete 50 percent of our passes. I would like to average 4 yards per carry. Those may be lofty figures. In our season this past year, we rushed for 2776 yards, and had 48 touchdowns. We did play 15 games. We were able to pass for 2491 yards. That is good balance, as far as I am concerned. We scored 20 touchdowns passing. Those may not be lofty figures, but if you are playing good defense as we did this year, it isn't bad. Our defense gave up 88 yards per game rushing.

In having a balanced attack, you can protect your defense. By that, I mean that we really work hard on the turnover category. We cover the end of the football with our middle finger. We pull our elbow down on the football. When we are in traffic, we put two hands on the football. We work with our quarterbacks in making good decisions. We will punt most of the time when in doubt about what to do. We try to make our opponents look at 70 to 80 yards every time they touch the football. We are playing a good layer defense, and by that I mean a four-man front, with three or five underneath with a two-deep secondary. We have three layers that you have to make it through before you hit a big play on us. We do not want to give up big plays on defense. We do not play a lot of man-to-man coverage. We just want to belly up and keep everything in front of us. Again, that is the philosophy that I believe in, and I have coached that way ever since day one. We try to make it work in Greeley, and so far it is working. Again, the better the athletes you have, the better it works. That is where we are coming from, philosophically.

I want to talk about the defensive problems that we are seeing now in our league. Teams that we are playing are going to an eight-man front. I think Buddy Ryan used this type defense and made it popular. The defense has their ears laid back, and they are lined up in a two-point stance. You do not know who is coming and who isn't. You have to anticipate an eight-man rush a lot of the time. You will get a lot of eight-man rush. Some of you may call it the full-court press, or max blitz, or whatever.

Last spring, our staff discussed our problems in handling the eight-man front. Our offensive coordinator, Kay Dalton, suggested that we go to the option. He knew we were not handling the eight-man front totally with the passing game. We needed to find a way to slow down the eight-man front.

We went to Lincoln and spent two days with an old friend of mine by the name of Coach Milt Tenopir of Nebraska. I knew Milt when he was a GA at Nebraska. I actually knew Coach Osborne when he was a GA, believe it or not. I spent some time with the Nebraska coaches and came back and put in some option plays in our offense. It is not our bread-and-butter offense. You would not believe how much it helped us this past year. We were not very good at hitting slant or fade routes, getting the ball to our backs out of the backfield, or tight end in pressure situations. If we did hit the back or the tight end, we were not making enough yards to hurt the blitz.

Now when we see the eight-man front or the blitz package, we kind of spit into our hands and say, "Oh goody, here we go." The option helped us win the national championship. We block the play just as we do on our outside zone play. That leaves one man left, and we pitch or keep on the option off that last man. If you have a quarterback who can run the option, it puts a hell of a bind on the defense. The small amount of time that we did run the option, it helped us a lot.

I guess it is true that the more we change, the more we remain the same. When I came into the game, power football was popular. Woody Hayes was at Ohio State; Bob Devaney was at Wyoming and later Nebraska. He was having success with a full-house set, and Duffy Daugherty at Michigan State was having success with the unbalanced line and power football. Then we developed the I formation. To me, the I formation is power football. Then we started seeing the option. Other teams adopted the option
