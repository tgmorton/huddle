We look hard in our game films for guys who do these drills in actual game situations. This drill is one you can find all the time. That is why it is so good. We set up a series of bags and make the linemen step over the bags using the form they worked on in the hands-down drill. They step over the bags going right and left. At the end of the bags to the right and left, we have a tackling lane with a ball carrier. We go through movement, change direction, see the ball carrier, explode up into the lane, and make the tackle.

This next drill is a million-dollar drill that you can get on credit. Go down to the hardware store. Buy some rubber tubing, and make a circle. Even when you pass-rush, you have to maintain good body position. We put two guys across the circle from one another, one in a right-handed stance and one in a left-handed stance. On movement, they run around the circle. They have to keep the hands down on the tubing. They have to lean to stay on the circle. The head is up, and the knees bent. When they get all the way around, they change directions and go the other way. This gives them the idea about coming around the horn in the pass rush. It teaches them to lean in and make the play on the quarterback instead of running past him.
