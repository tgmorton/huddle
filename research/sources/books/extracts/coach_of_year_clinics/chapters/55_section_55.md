A Simple Approach to the Passing Game

Skyline High School, Utah

It is a real privilege for me to speak to you. I have been to Denver several times. I enjoy coming to this clinic.

I will start off with a video of a game with Plano High School, Texas, when they needed four onside kicks at the end of the game to win. They were successful on all four onside kicks. They were down 41-17 in the last minutes of the game, made a great comeback, but lost the game at the end after they went ahead. They made a regular kick on the kickoff, and the other team returned it for a touchdown. [Video]

I could do a lecture just about the things that happened in that film. We show this tape to our kids to convince them to never give up. You always have a chance. I recall going to a clinic at the University of Colorado when Bill Mallory was the head coach. He brought in a high school coach from Cincinnati by the name of Bron Bacevich. Bron was a legend in Ohio. Bron talked about the fact that when you are down by only two touchdowns, you always have a chance to get back in the game. We try to emphasize this with our kids each week. It does not matter; as long as we are only down by two touchdowns, we have a chance to win the game. I really believe in this. It has happened to us several times. Our kids have been prepared and programmed to believe that they can come back and win.

We have some great coaches in the state of Utah. One is LaVell Edwards of BYU. Some of the best coaches in America are right here in Colorado. The Air Force Academy is on the cutting edge of what they do. The University of Colorado and Colorado State do a great job. The new staff at Wyoming will do a great job. You have a national champion in Northern Colorado. You can go to them and get information to help your program. You can attend clinics such as this. You are lucky to be here. I think I am lucky to be a head football coach. I hope you feel the same. A football coach has a big influence in the lives of young men. I have enjoyed this clinic and have gotten some good ideas that I think will help our program. I hope the material that I share with you today will help you in your program. I will tell you what we do at Skyline High School in Salt Lake City. Drop me a note if you are interested in additional materials.

You cannot have a good program without a great coaching staff. It does not matter whether your coaching staff is big or small or whether your school is big or small. I have found that most coaches are good teachers. I found that out at this clinic. You can tell if a coach is a good teacher because you just learn from him. You can pick up good things from good coaches.

People who have influenced me in my career include Coach LaVell Edwards. When I was a senior playing at BYU, it was his first year as an assistant coach at BYU. I did not get to know him that well. He was coaching a position different from what I was playing. I remember after we played at Arizona and got our butts kicked, he came up to me and said, "Roger, you did a good job." I felt bad that we had lost the game, but just that one comment from him stayed with me. I will remember that the rest of my life. I am sure you have remembered the good and the bad that your coaches told you when you were playing. If we can be positive with our players, it will pay off in the end. We are the dream makers for our players. Twenty years after they are away from football, they are not going to look back and say, "Boy, we had a great English teacher." They are going to say, "Do you remember what that dumb coach did that one day?'' They will talk about the coaches and remember the good and the bad things.

When Bill Walsh was speaking, I would try to go to listen to him. I first heard him speak in Reno when he spoke at a clinic just after he took the Stanford job.

Another name that I will mention is Tony Mason. He has passed away, but he was great. He was an
