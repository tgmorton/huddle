We want the ball up high on the drop. If you have the ball down low, you tend to fumble the ball. If the ball is up high, you can tuck it away and run. If you do fumble, you have a chance to recover it.

Next, we go to the carioca drill. Now we cross the front foot over the back foot as we back up. It is front-back, front-back, front-back. This is how we work this drill. We work the drill across the field or along the sidelines. You want the kid to do the drill on a straight line. We want him to come back straight on the line. Do it on the sideline or on a line across the field. We may start out on a walk-through. Then we gradually speed it up. We may go to half speed and then to three-quarters speed. We want it nice and smooth. Your kids will develop agility to do this drill. In a week you would be surprised what the kids can do in this drill. This helps develop the feet.

Next is the backpedal drill. We want them on the front half of their shoes. It is just like a defensive back on the backpedal. Instead of pumping the arms, the quarterback has a football in his arms. We want the weight distributed over the front of the shoes on the toes. We are looking downfield as we backpedal.

We can take a rolled up towel, take the quarterback, and do the side-to-side drill for footwork. We want him to step 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, throw. Next we have the quarterback step forward and then backward. We have him step over the towel and then back over the towel. We have him working his feet over the towel.

I am running short on time, and I want to teach the drop step. We have covered the agilities to improve the quarterback's footwork. We have covered how to improve the upper body. Now we want to go to the drop step. I have not gone into details, and I have not covered the stance and snap. They only gave me one hour to cover this material. Damn, Earl, this is a threeday lecture, and you only gave me one hour. I am going fast because I assume most of you know about the stance and how to take a snap.

Now I want to teach you the proper steps in the drop back. We use a power step and two shuffle steps. We always talk about the power step. When you take the football from the center, the power step is a good drive step. On the first step we want to turn the toes on the lead foot at an angle. We want to turn the toes of the back foot toward the sideline. By pointing the second step toward the sideline, it will help the quarterback stop. I got that from Dave Roberts when he was at Notre Dame. He is now the head coach at Baylor University. The second and third steps should stop the quarterback. The feet are the width of the shoulders. The chin is down so they can see the field. We want to take the power step, then two shuffle steps, and then stop.

I am going to give you two more terms. Once we get back on our drop, we have two kinds of steps. First is the hit, and the second is the hitch. A hit step is one step and throw. When we three- and five-step drop, we want a hit step. That is a 1-2-3 step. That is a hit step. Step and throw. We have the ball up ready to throw. We can move the feet 1, 2, 3, and throw. That is a hit step. If we drop back seven steps, we can use what we call a hitch step. The quarterback can come back, set up, hitch step, step up, and make the throw. Some of the young quarterbacks use the hitch step. Why? Because they are too weak to throw the ball from the deep position. They have to step up to get anything on the ball.

Now, we make all of our quarterbacks lift weights. All of our quarterbacks can bench-press at least 300 pounds. If you are getting hit, you had better have a body that can take it. The stronger the quarterback, the quicker he is. If a kid is quick, he can control his body. You can control your body when you are stronger. You can go one step and two shuffle steps, and that would be the three-step drop. You can go three power steps and two shuffle steps, and that is the five-step drop. The seven-step drop is five power steps and two shuffle steps. We still want to keep in mind trigger position and five major points in the drop.

We run an evasion drill. After we teach them to drop back at five steps, we do what we call a cross drill. They go back five steps and stop, slide to the right, slide all the way back to the left, come back to the middle, then a three-step drop, and throw the ball. [Demo] When do we teach this drill? If the rush comes,
