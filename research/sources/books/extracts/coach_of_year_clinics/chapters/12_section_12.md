The Oklahoma 4-3 Front Defense

University Of Oklahoma

Thank you, gentlemen. I would like to thank you for inviting me here. I know that a lot of time when we go to clinics we talk X's and O's. Football is much more than that. In this game you are dealing with kids. The first thing I'm going to talk to you about is philosophy. I'm going to talk about my philosophy and what I feel it's going to take to bring the University of Oklahoma back.

The fact is that there is no discipline in our schools any more. I give credit for the course of my life to my mom and dad. They instilled values in me. They led me into my beliefs and religion. Jesus Christ is the foundation of my success. The only one I have to please is God. I think we should thank God for being here today and for our opportunities. I am a young coach, and I know what it takes. I think the most important things that got me where I am today are my respect for people around me, my parents, and Jesus Christ.

I've got a wife and a nine-month-old baby boy that I thank God for every day. A great deal of my guidance came from my high school coach. Every coach in here had that time when they left mom and dad's influence. That was a big time in my life, because I turned to my high school coach, and he turned me toward God. All of you sitting out there can do the same thing. I thank God for the high school coaches. I know you don't make a lot of money, but it takes a special person to help the kids of today. I know what you go through. I thank you for the effort you show toward the kids and the patience you have with them. It's tough.

I came back to Oklahoma for one reason. I liked it in the NFL and could have stayed there. But I wanted to coach the young men at Oklahoma. They were struggling and needed somebody. I told the president that 90 percent of my time would be spent with the kids, not the X's and O's of football. These kids were under all kinds of pressure from their peers to take the wrong path. There is so much in our society that can lead our kids down the wrong road. Drugs, alcohol, stealing, and all different social ills are out there to prey on these kids. I want to get into the kids' hearts and minds.

There is not much difference between a good player and a great one. If you take a good player and discipline him, get him to lift weights, and get him to do what you say and if he is coachable, he can become a great player. A great player may be able to make the plays, but if you can't control him, he'll hurt you in the long run.

You can develop outstanding players. I've seen it in the NFL. The Dallas Cowboys are a tremendously talented team. But all it takes is one or two plays to decide whether you win or lose a football game. We blew out some people, but so many other times if Troy had not made a great pass or someone didn't make a block, we would have gotten beat.

I know the commitment it takes to be a professional football player. It takes discipline to play 60 minutes of football. On this level the players are paid to do a job. That is not the case in college or high school. I understand that. That is why my one goal is to take care of my players. Half of the meetings I have with my team are not about football. I talk to them about drugs and alcohol. I talk about being out late at night. I talk about who they hang out with and peer pressure. Those are the things I talk about with my players.

I love being at Oklahoma. I played there. I know what it takes, and I left the NFL for that reason. I came back to lead and protect these kids, and I hope Oklahoma gets back on top. I need your help. I know how important you are. I want to recognize you and help you in any way I can. Getting to college coaching is not about who knows the most. It is about opportunity.
