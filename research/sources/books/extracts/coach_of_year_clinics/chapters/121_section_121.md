RELEASE DRILL

The quarterback is in a set position. The coach will throw his hands up in the air. The quarterback releases the ball as quickly as possible. Start at 15 yards apart, and vary the depth and angle of throws. Get the ball out of your hands!

Next is our carioca drop-n-throw and our tapioca dropn-throw. We have a quarterback and a wide receiver. First the coach blows the whistle. The quarterback must carioca and set his feet. The whistle blows again and he throws the football to the receiver.

CARIOCA DROP-N-THROW AND TAPIOCA DROP-N-THROW

The coach blows the whistle. The quarterback takes the snap and carioca- or tapioca-drops. The coach blows the whistle again. The quarterback sets his feet and delivers the ball. You can vary the spots for the receiver. The whistle may blow while the quarterback s in the middle of the carioca. If that happens, the quarterback must get set and throw the football as soon as possible. We do not want to run the drills where we are throwing the ball straight ahead all of the time. We like to practice throwing at angles. Throw at a spot. If you run a curl that week, work on the curl route. We like to let the quarterback throw to the spot where he will be throwing to in a game.

In the tapioca drill we take quicker and choppier steps. Now we want to get the ball away much quicker. That is what our quick-five pass drop is. We take the short, choppy steps.

The fourth throwing drill is what we call our avoid drill. You may not want to work on this, but we feel we have to.

AVOID DRILL

The quarterback takes the snap and drops on a quick-five or a big-five drop. He sets on the fifth step. He must avoid the rush to the right or left. Then he must sidestep and throw the ball to the wide receiver. He must reset his feet before throwing the ball. If he gets pressure from one side, he must slide, reset his feet, and then throw. We have the dummies set up deep enough to simulate the depth that we want the quarterback to drop. Most quarterbacks want to get out of the pocket when they get pressure. It is a feeltype thing that the quarterback must experience. The way to work on that is running this drill over and over. You work on throwing from both sides.

Next is our step-up drill. Now the quarterback must step up in the pocket to make the pass.
