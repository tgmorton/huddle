scheme. We see this about every week. We may see some eight-man fronts. Everything in our running game is set against the 4-3 defense. We believe that the teams will take their best players and put them at defensive ends. They place them there where they can get up the field and cause problems for the offense. They match up their most talented player against our least talented player. That would be our offensive tackle. We have tried to come up with a system where we do not have to put our worst player up against their best player.

We are a formation team; we are not a motion team. I will show you what we try to do with our formation. We are basically not a tight-end team unless we are going to come into a power game. We go three wide and four wide to run the ball. We want to spread the defense out. We are three wide or four wide, depending on which linebacker we want to get rid of. We know if we go three wide, we can remove the Sam linebacker and make him play the strong safety. If we go four wide, we can make the Will linebacker play the eight-man front outside. We may want the Will linebacker to stay in against our running game because we think our fullback is better. What we look for is match-ups. If we can't match up with one of the linebackers, we will take a wideout and move him outside. That is the basis of what we do in the running game.

I want to show you what we have done with a couple of plays. We took these two plays and made a series out of them. It is the same old belly play that we have all run for years and years. Against the 4-3 defense, we feel that we have had an effect. What we do differently is this. We block the play the same way most of you do. The thing we do differently is to send our tailback opposite. For years, the belly play was off the sweep with full flow to the play side. We send the tailback opposite for two reasons. We are trying to hang the Will linebacker. We would love for him to be keying the tailback on the play. If we can get him to do that, we have a good play. His alignment will determine the block of our tackle. When teams true-stack against us, our tackle can shift through the 5 technique and get to the Will linebacker. Again, it is not a fullflow play.
