Strength movements can be short and slow. If you are maxing on a squat or squatting on a bench, it is very slow movement.

Next we get into some keys and some applications. In the off-season, what day are you the freshest? Monday! They had the whole weekend off. That is the day we are going to do our speed training. We are going to do some type of movement warm-up. We do a lot of different things in our warm-up. After that, we are going to do light, explosive things. We do hang snatches. This is how we teach hangs and snatches. We teach it backwards or from the top down. The first thing we teach is space. Then we teach from the hang, and then we teach it backwards.

What is our base? The easiest way to teach our kids is to jump three times and land in a breakdown position. That is the position they are going to hang-clean. All they are going to do is to jump with weight. Now they are ready to go. That is how they set their feet. That is the first clue: feet.

Our next clue is the knees. What do I mean by knees? The bend of the knees. How far? If there is a wall in front of me and my toes are touching the wall, then my knees touch the wall.

The next clue is the chest. I want to tighten my lats up and get a big chest. Now I have feet, knees, and chest.

The last clue is my wrist. I am going to turn my wrist over. There is a straight line down my wrist. Now I have feet, knees, chest, and wrist. We get our guys standing up tall, holding broomsticks. We are going to do two things, but one at a time. My guys can only do one thing at a time. When I ask them to remember two things at a time, that is when we start having problems. We remember one thing at a time. We are going to go feet, knees, chest, and wrist. Now we want them to bend over. Now jump. They will ask, "Do you mean off the ground?" Yes! That is a jump. It is feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, and jump. Everyone can do that because it is a very simple movement. That is great posture. Posture is a key in sports. You can't shoot a free throw without posture, and you can't squat without posture. You can't pitch without posture. You can't swing a bat without posture. You can't power-clean without posture. Feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, jump. Very good.

Now, let's do an upright row. They will keep the elbows down. I tell them to get the elbows up. It is elbows up, back under, up, back under. Now we have them put it together. Feet, knees, chest, wrist, bend over, jump. Good, you can clean. Let's go to a bar. It takes about that long. If you have 10 players, it takes a little longer. That is how we teach the clean. They can learn to clean in about one day.

We always go from the hang for about one month. After about two or three weeks of hang-clean, we will do hang-snatch. It is the same thing. The only difference is that we are going to have a wide grip. How wide? We have grooves on the bar, so we say get outside the bar. We adjust them as we go. We tell them to get outside the bar, and we coach them on the run. Again, feet, knees, chest, and wrist. Now, in the bend-over in the clean, I bend to here, and in the snatch I bend to here. [Demo] We just cover the bar more with the shoulders. It is feet, knees, wrist, chest, bend over, and now jump.

Now, it is feet, knees, chest, wrist, and upright rowing. This is hard for them. Football players tend to be weak back here and strong up here. They start to lift that broomstick, and they want to lift with the grip wide. No! A lot of them can't even do it with a wide grip. We want them to come back inside, then drop the elbows, and then push. Upright row, drop the elbows, and push. We always keep pressure on the bar. They think they can reach down and bring it straight up, but they end up on their back. We want them to drop the elbow and
