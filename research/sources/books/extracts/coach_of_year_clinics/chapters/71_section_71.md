6 yards. If it was a zone defense, he turned and spotted up. As much as we drill and run this play, our backs still want to break the pattern off at 3 and 4 yards. He has to get to 6 yards so the quarterback knows where he is.

The quarterback takes a five-step drop. He gets his depth in his first two steps. The next three steps are gathering steps. When he hits his fifth step, he delivers the ball to the halfback. He can't move around so the quarterback can find him. The halfback spots up between the middle and weak-side linebackers.

The defense knows about the H option. They study our tendencies and have a feeling for when we run the play. The outside linebacker, instead of dropping so deep, drops shallow and tries to squeeze the halfback. When that happens, the tight end becomes the number one receiver.

If the defense showed man coverage, we still run the same patterns. If the outside linebacker blitzes, the halfback knows that probably the middle linebacker has coverage on him. The halfback has a free release. The fullback comes over to take the blocking responsibility of the halfback. The halfback run his 6yard pattern, leans in on the linebacker, and breaks out. He does not spot up on a man coverage. He runs an out cut.

From this play came the most successful running play we have in our offense. It is called "draw trap." This play looks like the H option. The guard, if he is covered, tries to get his man to rush inside. The tackle gives his pass set then comes off for the inside linebacker. The center block backs for the cutoff. The backside guard pulls and traps the first thing to show past the guard. The halfback drives hard as in the H option and blocks the weak linebacker. On the snap of the ball, the fullback takes a step toward the trap and waits. The quarterback brings the ball back, slides it to the fullback, and breaks inside the trap block. This first example is against an even 4-3 front.

Let me show you different ways of blocking it against different fronts. Early on, if the defense got into a Bear front, we had a tendency to automatically drop out of the play. We don't now. Let's look at the odd-50 front. The left tackle takes a hard inside step and invites the tackle to rush outside. After he does that, he comes up on the inside linebacker. The left guard takes his inside step. He and the center have to block the noseguard and backside linebacker. They do it with an area scheme. If the noseguard slants into the strong gap or plays the center head up, the center takes him. If he goes weak, the left guard takes him. The right guard pulls and traps. The right tackle seals inside. The back blocks the weak outside backer. The quarterback and fullback do the same thing.
