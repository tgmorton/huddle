better people. Like all coaches, I want athletes who are disciplined in all phases of their life. For me, this includes physical discipline (lifting, running, staying in shape), mental discipline (this precedes all else), emotional discipline (staying calm under pressure), social discipline (this includes drinking, drugs, friendships, etc.), and spiritual discipline.

I look for leadership at all levels. We expect more from our players the older they get. I do not discipline all of our players the same way. I used to think that you had to treat everyone the same as a coach. I don't believe that anymore. We have more invested in our upperclassmen, so we expect more from them. If we are going to be good, our seniors must be in it with us. It really hasn't been much of a problem for us. I like to use the mind-over-matter principle: I don't mind, and they don't matter.

Our offensive philosophy is based on the premise that we will establish the run first. Running the ball breeds toughness on offense. My quarterback coach tells me all the time that ''the quickest way from here to there is through the air,'' but I tell him that running the ball breeds toughness. Our tailback rushed for over 1100 yards as a sophomore and over 1500 yards this year as a junior. Again, we are committed to running the football.

Second, we are going to use different sets to run the same plays. A good way for our coaches to get a play into our offense is to show me how many different ways we can run the same play. We use motion across the formation, we use short motion, we use tight-end motion, and I would like to start using backfield motion. It has been interesting for me to coach offense after being on the defensive side for nine years. I want to make opposing defensive coordinators work on all kinds of shifts and motions. If they don't, I want to be able to use motions and shifts to give us an advantage. We won't use all the various shifts and motions in every game, but it sure makes our opponents work on things. The basic set that we use is the I formation. We will be in a two-back set about 95 percent of the time.

What It Takes To Block

A. EffortBlocking is hard work. I have to have guys up front who will work hard.

B. SkillsWe do most of our line drills every day. I tell that to our offensive line the first day of camp so they will know what to expect. They know I never get tired of working on the fundamentals of line play, so they better get used to it.

C. KnowledgeWe are fortunate at Hope because our kids are smart. Our average GPA in this year's freshman class is a 3.5, with an average ACT score of 26.

D. StrengthOur kids are getting stronger, but we still have work to do in this area. We test our kids three times a year in the squat, military, bench press x 225, pro shuttle run, body fat, and the 40yard dash. We also do an 8 x 110 test that we picked up from the Bears. We run eight 110-yard sprints with 45 seconds' rest between each one. We found with a timed half mile or mile that our best kids could bust their butt and make the time without being in shape. That is less likely with the 110 test. If they are not in shape, they will not make their time.

E. ToughnessI want to coach scrappy, hard-nosed players.

F. AnticipationI am a big believer in the first step on the offensive line. We win a lot of battles up front with quickness and anticipation off the ball.

G. ConditioningWe probably do less true conditioning during practice time than most high schools. We expect our players to report to camp in shape. We try to drill a lot at full speed to make up for this.

PersonnelWhat We Look For In Offensive Linemen

A. ToughnessPractice it; preach it; accept nothing less.

B. QuicknessQuickness is more important to me than speed. I have seen too many good linemen who have poor 40 times to think that it is vitally important to our success.
