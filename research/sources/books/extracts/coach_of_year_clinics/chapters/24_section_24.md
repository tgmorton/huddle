letter to the rules committee, and we kept it in. I like to think my letter saved the dropkick. We may be the only team that still does the dropkick anymore. My dad taught me the technique to drop-kick. It has been important to me to keep the dropkick in the books. My dad is still living, and he played when they used the dropkick.

We started using the dropkick, and it became a tradition. In 1978 we did it in a game finally. We were ahead at the time, and the kid tried the dropkick and made it. The referee come over and gave me a hug. He said that he had been officiating for 40 years and when he played football that is what they used to do. He was retiring at the end of that game, and he had not seen the dropkick used in all of his years of officiating. What we do is to have a senior dropkick contest. Some of the kids who do not play football go out and practice drop-kicking. This year we had a lot of good kickers. We even had a soccer-style kicker drop-kick the ball. That was a first for us. In one game he made five or six kicks drop-kicking. We even drop-kicked a couple of kickoffs. It is a fun thing to do, and when we are way ahead or way behind, we use it. Establish your own tradition.

Let me talk about assistant coaches. When I first came out of college in 1976, I tried to coach it all. I was the head coach of everything. The assistants got to coach their positions, and that was it. We started out and were 1-3. After we got beat in our homecoming game, I decided to turn over the defense to one of the assistants. That was the best thing that happened to me. I learned to let assistants coach. It is important to let them have responsibility. It gives them ownership in the team. When we get an award for the season, it is for all of the coaches and not just the head coach. It takes a whole staff to be successful. Our coaches go scouting together and watch films together.

Next, I want to talk about recruiting in your school. Football numbers are important. We all know that. Track and football are the only two sports where you can have a lot of kids out there. It would be good to have five football programs if we had enough players out. What we do is this. We make a list of 8th, 9th, and 10th graders not out for football. It is not so important for the older kids. We have 45 to 50 kids out for football. We have kids walking the halls that should be playing. I am sure it is the same at your school. I am not talking about the butt heads. I am talking about good kids. They may not be good athletes, but they are good kids. They get good grades, and they are dependable. They could be helping your program, and you could be helping them. We get some kids who stick with it and some who quit. But we really make an effort to get more players out for the team. Another thing we have done is to write a letter to each class. We send the team a letter on the subject, and then I send individuals letters encouraging them to give football a try.

On the other side of the issue is weight lifting versus other sports. I would rather have players in another sport than lifting. I teach weight-lifting classes. I get most of the team lifting. We have really seen some progress, but I would much rather have them playing basketball and hockey.

You must realize that attitude is the key. I always start the season with this point. I tell our team that our season will depend on our attitude and our offensive line. I put the pressure on the offensive line right away. I would always rather take an average player with a great attitude than a great player with a poor attitude. I seem to do the best coaching job when I have a great player with a great attitude. I can do a good job of coaching that type kid. If I had more of them, I could really do a good job. An average player with a great attitude can play for you.

Potential will get you beat. We play performers and producers. Also along these lines, we play and practice with enthusiasm. We have fun during the game. A lot of teams will look at us before the game, and we do not say a word. We got out-yelled 13 times this year before the game. We do not waste our energy yelling during the pregame.

We probably do our best job in placement of our personnel. We do an off-season scouting report. Basically, we take a look at the personnel, see whether we need to switch players to other positions, and see what we have to do to be up to date.
