Let me go over these very quickly. Our three-step game is gap protection. It is the passing game with the hitch routes. In maximum protection, if the defense gives you a bunch of blitz, you keep the backs in and have them check on the release. Sprint-draw protection is off our isolation series. Split-draw protection is just what it indicates, with split backs. Shotgun and drop-back protection is the toughest protection we have. People ask us what kind of offense we run. We tell them this: "We are an I-option, power-sweep, 'iso,' no-back, shotgun, and one-back offense." They say, "What? You are kidding me!" No! If we are in long-yardage situations, we get in the shotgun. We also use the option-pass protection. If you are going to run the option, you have to have the option pass. We run the ball down the line and make it look like the run. We throw to the wideouts in the perimeter game. We run the bootleg, waggle, and naked protections. We do not run them much, but we have them.

You have to have a plan if you are overmatched. If we are overmatched at the two tackles and they are getting upfield, we have a way to double them. We also have a way to sprint away from them. We have our sprint-out protection. We also have the ability to dash away from them. By 
dash 
we mean to pull the backside guard and get the quarterback on the edge if we are having trouble with the pass rush. We will let our offensive linemen use the cut block as a changeup block on our pass protection.

Next, I want to talk about our half-line option drill. We have the coaches stationed where they can watch the drill. The quarterback coach watches the quarterback and fullback. I am in between the two groups. We have our wide-receiver coach with one group and another coach with the other group. We are looking for reps.

Again, we run two groups at a time. We have a coach outside with the wideouts. Both groups go at one time. We rotate quarterbacks and fullbacks every play. We rotate the line every three plays. If you do not have many people, you would run one group at a time. This drill is to the boundary. We work two groups on offense, and the third team is our scout team. We work against all of the different looks to the boundary.

HALF-LINE OPTION DRILL TO THE BOUNDARY

When we face an eight-man front, we run our option to the field. If the defense has an eight-man front with a three-deep, we do not have enough men to run the option to the weak side. We run the option to the field. We run back-to-back half-line drills with two teams going at one time.

HALF-LINE OPTION DRILL TO FIELD, BACK-TO-BACK
