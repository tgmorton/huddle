is multiple, it has tendencies. We do a five- to seven-game breakdown on people we play. In the secondary, we are going to roll the coverage to your best receiver or where you like to throw the ball.

If the offense comes out in a running set, we get into the eight-man front and stop the run. The quickest way to get beat is not being able to stop the run. We have been number one, two, or three in the NFL since I've been at the Houston Oilers in rushing defense. If you are a tight-end-running team, we kick over. If you run to the split end, we kick under. We have one more than you can block either way, and we will kick your butt.

Our BF stands for blitz the formation. I call a coach who just picks a blitz a Rolodex coach. If you happen to call the wrong blitz, you have a corner somewhere on that field trying to cover their best receiver all over the field. You have lost. We want to blitz and guarantee a hit on the quarterback.

We study your protection. If we know that you are going to get three out to the strong side, we use that to our advantage. The third receiver strong is a hot receiver. We know that the center is blocking weak and that the split back is check-releasing weak. We know that the quarterback is reading the fourth rusher strong as his hot read. Our blitz is coming from the fourth strong attitude. The lesser corner can take away the inside. He knows that all he has to play is a 6-yard stem. The ball is coming off; otherwise the quarterback is on his back. The defense has a free rusher.

We know whether you have the potential to block eight. When you do that, we bring nine. We have to have a free blitz man coming so that the corner is guaranteed heat and only has to cover the short route. We get there in a hurry, or we get beat in a hurry. We don't have to die that slow death with the quarterback standing back there baking a pizza.

When I was in high school, we double-called our coverage. We played one or the other, depending on the set. Ten of the players got the check, and one didn't. All he listened to was what was called in the huddle. He played the first call and not the second. What we do is this: All 11 break the huddle, and none of them know what is going on. Here is the huddle call: "AFDC, ready, break." They have to listen to the communications that are going on as the offense comes out to set up. They have to hear the Mike linebacker and free safety, and they all have to be on the same page. Otherwise, we are going to have a really crappy down. The thought process isn't that far out of whack. We put the best front-up that we can when you are going to run the ball and the best coverage when you throw it.

Tuesday is the off day for our players. That is in the collective bargaining agreement. That is when we put together the game plan. That is when we put together the formations, tendencies, runs, and passes.

On Wednesday we work on first- and second-down calls. On Thursday we repeat the hard first- and second-down calls and work really hard on the third-down calls. On Friday we throw all the crap at them, which includes goal line, short yardage, and that kind of stuff. On Saturday we review, and we play on Sunday.

In the drill part of linebacker play, we use these types of drills. We talk about defeating a block. We talk about defending-area responsibility against a run. We drill them in gap control. We give them a pass coverage key, zone or man to man. The last thing we talk about is pursuit.

Two things before I start the film. I always felt that if I could take one thing home from each guy who spoke, I had had a hell of a clinic. I learned a lot of things, even if it was just a different way to say the things I was doing. If it makes the kid understand because the new way is more descriptive, that is worth it. Here is the first thing Jack Pardee taught me. A linebacker is an in-between player. He has to be tough enough to play the run and have enough finesse to play the pass. The in-between player has to be coached this way. He lines up to stop the run and reacts to the pass, or he plays pass coverage keys and reacts to the run, but he is not going to do both. You are doing that linebacker an injustice if you are not coaching him that way.
