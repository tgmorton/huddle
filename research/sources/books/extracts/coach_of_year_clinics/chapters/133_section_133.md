Hal Mumme

An Update on the New UK Offense

University Of Kentucky

Thank you. It is really good to be here today. It is an honor to get to speak at this great clinic. I hope our staff has had a chance to visit with you this week. I apologize that I have not been here for the whole clinic, and I know this is a big clinic for the state of Kentucky. My wife has cancer right now, and these were the only five days she was allowed to leave Valdosta, Georgia, to come to Lexington to look for a house. We have been house hunting the last four or five days. I am sure some of you can identify with that. The good thing is that we have found a house that we can buy, and we will be able to move in very soon. In the future, I intend to be at this clinic each year. Hopefully, our staff has gotten to know some of the coaches here.

I have spent a lot of my career as a high school football coach. That part of the game is really important to me. I hope it is something that carries over into our program at the University of Kentucky.

A few years ago a friend of mine by the name of Spike Dykes of Texas Tech came to play in our golf tournament at Valdosta State. We had a couple of good years at Valdosta State. We were talking with Spike, and he asked me what my ambitions were. I said, "I think I want to stay a head coach." A lot of Division II head coaches move up to become coordinators at a Division I school. I told Spike that I liked being the head coach and that I liked being the boss. I guess that was the basic reason. He asked me what I thought my next step would be in the coaching profession. I said, "Well, my last name is M-U-M-M-E, I coach at V-A-L-D-O-S-T-A State, and we play our games in a high school stadium. I have set my goals for the next job to be in a school where everyone would know where we were talking about without having to spell it out. It is hard enough with a name like Mumme to communicate. You pick up the phone and say, 'This is Hal Mumme from Valdosta State.' You have to spell everything in the sentence for them." So I told Spike Dykes that I wanted to coach someplace where the school owned their own stadium and when you said the school, everyone would know where you were. Then all I would have to do would be to spell my last name. I guess the good Lord took care of us. He fulfilled my dreams with the Kentucky job. It is great to be in the state and in the SEC.

My topic today is supposed to be "An Update on University of Kentucky Football." I have only been here for two and a half months, so I do not have a lot to say about that. I know we have not had a winning season in eight years. I know we have a great quarterback. If he can overcome my coaching the next few years, he probably will be one of the best in the nation. We have a long way to go in terms of the rest of the positions. However, here are some things that may be of interest to you. After that, I will talk about some offense. That is what I like to talk about. Then I will give you a chance to ask questions about what we are going to do. Also, I will show a highlight video at the end of the talk.

I do not think the job at the University of Kentucky is any different from any other jobs that I have had as the head coach. The head coach is in charge of these things. He must have complete vision. What I mean by that is this: You must be able to visualize what you want the program to look like. This carries down to your staff. Your defensive coordinator must visualize what the defense looks like. You must visualize what it looks like in every situation. You must visualize what it looks like when you play an option team, what it looks like when you play a passing team, what it looks like at its inception. You have to visualize what it will look like at the start of the season and in the off-season as you group the players by position and into units. As you go through the spring, you must visualize what the team is supposed to look like at the end of spring. Next year, the high schools of Kentucky will be able to have spring practice, and you will be able to visualize what your players are doing. I think that will help the game in Kentucky. But the head coach must be able to totally visualize the situations.
