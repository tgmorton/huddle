what we call "Run the Hoop." That is the hoop circle we use in practice. We feel it takes a tackle two years to learn how to play the trap by himself.

On the double-team block, step straight up the field and punch the hips to avoid the hips of the offensive linemen coming together. On the second step continue upfield, splitting the double-team and find the second key. If you start to give up movement, drop the outside knee and tackle the outside lineman. Do not drop to the ground unless you absolutely have to.

On the scoop block step straight upfield and punch the hip. On the second step, step down with the lineman and rip the backside arm through the scoop blocker while still penetrating.

With the down block we still step straight upfield and punch the hip. On the second step, feel the pressure of the down block and "Run the Hoop" finding the second key. This is running around the block, but if you stay tight this is a good technique. If you get pinned by the down block, fight across the face of spin over the top of the down block.

When our linebackers line up we want them to use a progression to make the play. We key the backfield for direction and flow. We play and secure the primary gap first. We want to get in the gap and play vertical. If he doesn't make the play, make it go somewhere else.

We read four flows. The Mike linebacker shades strong most of the time at a depth of 5 yards. If we get double tight ends, he shades weak. That is for vision so he can see the midline player. The Sam and Will linebackers are at 5 yards deep, sneaking up to 4.5. The Sam and Will linebackers line up in 50 techniques. Their inside leg is splitting the crotch of the tackle. They always key the near back. We pick the five best plays our opponents run and that is all we look at for the week we are preparing for them. From those five plays we key the guy who gets the football the most. In split backs the Mike linebacker keys through the quarterback for directional opening to the nearest flow. His first step is at the directional opening of the quarterback. After that he goes to the immediate flow. If we see the isolation play, that is a full-flow play for us. The Will linebacker is taking on the isolation block with his outside arm free. We force the iso back to the inside. The Mike linebacker cleans up in the B gap. We number the gaps 1, 3, 5, and 9. The Will linebacker is a 31-gap player. If the ball comes at him, he plays 3 gap. Ball away from him, he plays 1 gap. The Mike linebacker is a 13 player. Ball at him, he plays 1. If it goes away, he plays 3 gap. The Sam linebacker is a 51 player. Ball at him, he plays 5; and ball away, he plays 1 gap.

We tell the Sam and Will linebackers on full flow toward to go fill the hole. On flow away, stack on the nose or tackle. There is no shuffle. It is a 45-degree angle at the tail of our nose tackle. The trouble area is the tackle getting on the Will linebacker on plays away. We want no shuffle to prevent being cut off. On a play away from the linebacker, he rips inside the tackle and squeezes the guards. Full flow has the threat of a cutback.

Fast flow has no threat of a cutback. That is the toss sweep, speed option, and plays like that. We turn the linebackers loose and let them run. Any vertical seam they see, they get in it and go after the ball. The Sam linebacker on flow to him, blows the C gap. The Mike linebacker picks the first vertical seam and fires. The Will linebacker runs over the top and goes vertical only when he has to.

I'm out of time but there is one coverage I want to show you. It has made a huge difference for us. It is our 2-back coverage, which we call COVER 8. We sold out to stopping the run when we went to the 4-3 defense. We wanted a coverage that gave us an extra player. If the offense has two backs in the backfield, 90 percent of the time we are in COVER 8. The safeties align outside the number 2 receiver in an outside shade. They are going to do what we call "patting their feet." The safeties are 10 yards deep and the corners are 5 yards deep. We start every defensive coverage at these depths. That is our disguise.

The safeties line up at 10 yards and sneak up to 8 yards before the ball is snapped. They pat their feet and key the number 2 receiver. Obviously we are thinking run.
