They scored the 6 at the end of the game. That's motivation.

Let's talk about the punter. There are two types of punters. There is the slicer and the conventional type. You do not want a slicer. If you are a slicer, you can't control the ball.

Let's talk about the grip of the ball. There are four panels on the football. It doesn't matter how you number the panels. I start with the one to the left of the strings as you hold the ball. A right-footed kicker's right thumb goes on the first panel of the ball. The index finger and middle finger go on the second panel. The ring finger and little finger go on the third panel. On a Wilson football, there is a trademark. It's a circle with an R in it. When I talk about the dot, that is what I'm talking about.

The ball sits in the fingers. Don't palm the ball. It is just as for the quarterback: I want to see air under the fingers. We want the ball back in our fingers so that we can drop the ball down to our side and be able to hold it. It is almost a natural placement of fingers on the ball. I want to be able to place the ball in my fingers and walk, talk, or swing the ball. That means I've got the right pressure on the fingers and no pressure on the palms. Have your punter drop his hands to his sides. Walk up and place the ball in his right hand. It automatically goes in the proper place.

Don't put the ball in the fingertips. To hold the ball in the fingertips, you have to squeeze it with the hand. If you squeeze it with the fingers, you have no control over it. Also, if you squeeze with the fingers, your elbow will go inside, and we certainly don't want that. I have them grip the ball. If I can place my fingers on the ball and take it away from him, he doesn't have control of the ball. If the punter puts the ball in his palm, it is easy to take away from him. The grip is on the back third of the ball.

If he grips the ball, swings it up to the middle, and extends his left hand, that is where it goes. His left hand may be adjusted up on the ball somewhat, but it is a mirror of his right hand. We want a small bend in the back of the kicker. What I am trying to teach you is how to get the ball in the perfect spot every time.

As we swing the ball up and stop it, we can see that the ball is not straight. It is automatically three to five degrees inside and three to five degrees down. If you take the ball in the fingertips, it pulls your wrist and elbow inside, which is not natural.

The next thing is the stance of the punter. We want a parallel stance. That doesn't mean that you won't stagger your stance a little bit. That depends on the punter. We always start off parallel. If the punter is kicking the ball downfield, the only way that can happen is if the body is going downfield. If my hips are pointed outside, I cannot punt the ball downfield. It is impossible to do unless the punter is a slicer. Everything the punter does is going downfield. His shoulders, hips, and feet are all going downfield.

We want no weight on the toe or heel. We want a comfortable stance. We don't want to be leaning forward on the toe. I want a slight bend in the leg. I do not want a straight leg. If the punter is straight legged, that means his butt is out. He wants his butt forward but a slight bend in the legs. We want him to be relaxed in his stance.

The hands are relaxed. When the punter receives the ball, he does not want his hands locked. I don't want those hands extended forward with the elbows locked. I want them relaxed. After he relaxes, he moves his hands up into position. If he locks his hands, that will force him straight up. He has about four inches between his elbow and his body.

The target area for the center snap is just below the chest and just above the crotch. A good drill for the snapper is the one-man sled. Place the sled at the punter's depth, and let him practice snapping the ball at the sled. A lot of people talk about the speed of the snap. It is not speed; it is accuracy. We talk about .7 for the snap.

I've had about five pro coaches call about our punter. I asked them who coaches their punter. The response
