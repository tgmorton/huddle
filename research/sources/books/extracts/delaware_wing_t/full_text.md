We wrote this series of five books, The Delaware Wing-T: The Running Game, The Option 
Game and the Passing Game, 101Delaware Wing-T Drills, and 101 Delaware Wing-T Plays to 
provide coaches at all competitive levels with tools to enable them to better understand 
and implement the Delaware Wing-T. Each volume is designed to complement the other 
four books. 
Volume 1 examines how to institute an effective running game with the Delaware Wing-T 
offense. Volumes 2 and 3 present an overview of how we employ an option attack and a 
passing attack, respectively, from the Delaware Wing-T. Volume 4 provides 101 drills for 
developing, practicing and refining the various essential fundamentals and techniques that 
are integral to the Delaware Wing-T. Finally, Volume 5 includes 101 basic plays that can be 
incorporated into a Delaware Wing-T offensive system. 
Collectively, we hope that these books will provide you with the insights, the information 
and the foundation needed to fully comprehend and utilize the Delaware Wing- T. Properly 
executed, this unique offense can enable you to take advantage of your players’ specific 
talents and skills in a goal-oriented, creative way. 
Football is a great game. As ametaphor for life, football involves many of the critical 
elements that are required for success in almost any undertaking—sacrifice, hard work, 
teamwork, planning and an unrelenting commitment to excellence. To the extent that this 
series of five books (and a companion series of five instructional videos) enables you—in 
some small way—to appreciate this terrific game even more, then our efforts to write 
these volumes and to produce these videos will have been well worthwhile.

Principles of the Wing-T Running Game 
The Wing-T run offense is unlike any other offensive ground game. The Wing-T 
combines misdirection and deception, power, finesse, and the capability of hard 
dives with a passing game which enhances the running attack. Because of its 
multiplicity, the Wing-T attack can not be generalized as a singular style of offense. 
Although its history can lead you to visualize the Wing-T as a one-sided four-back 
running attack, the Wing-T is neither a pure running attack nor a passing attack. 
Comparison of the Wing-T to other offensive schemes Is difficult because the 
Wing-T fits no standard mode. Like all works of fine art, the Wing-T is open to 
interpretation. Identical terminology and formation structure could deliver a 
dominating running game to one coach, while giving another coach a medium 
through which a virtual air raid could be launched. 
Although the Wing-T is a multiple formation offense, the technique of the backs Is 
constant. The consistency of the back techniques and alignment is a key factor in 
maintaining balance and deception anid

BASIC PRINCIPLES 
The Wing-T is emulated on every level of football and is probably the most popular 
and successful offense in the history of modern football. The inherent flexibility of 
the Wing-T has allowed it to adjust to defensive trends for over four decades. In 
over forty years, the following Wing-T precepts have remained unaltered:

MORE THAN A FORMATION 
The Wing-T is more than a formation. Its 
versatile offense characterized by 
he Wing-T may be correctly 
described 
as a four-back formation 
ing offense. The Wing-T may also be correctly described as a one-back 
formation and a spread offense. Strangely enough, the Wing-T offense’s renowned 
running game is paradoxically dependent upon the threat and execution of the 
passing game. The nature of the principal passing scheme is naturally one of a play- 
action nature with the quarterback either keeping the ball toward or away from the 
flow of the attack.

y 
sing 2 wing rer raneite styles softened the defense for the principal style of attack— 
the hard line charges. The use of misdirection was the benchmark of the innovative 
coach. The “best” coaches of the era were the coaches who practiced endlessly on 
hiding the ball with criss-crossing back action and spinning backs with meticulous 
ball faking. Misdirection was universally accepted as the phase of the game where 
one coach could out-coach another. The use of misdirection was usually the key 
factor in the major upsets of the day. The most telling proof of this theory lies in 
Columbia's 1934 upset victory over Stanford. Columbia was a modest three- 
touchdown underdog to the powerhouse Stanford. Columbia's coach, Lou Little, 
designed a highly deceptive double spinner. The legendary editor of Scholastic 
Coach magazine, Herman L. Masin, described the play in his editorial column in the 
May/June issue of 1996 as follows: 
The ball was snapped to the tailback (4), who made a 180 degree spin to the left 
half (3), then another spin to the right half (1). The 2 back, the right guard, and the 
center pulled to the left as a phalanx. Three key things had to happen: The defensive 
end had to be convinced that the ball was being reversed to number 1, the right 
guard had to nail the linebacker, and the left end had to go downfield and wipe out 
the safety man. The play worked like a dream. The tailback reversed to the first man 
(3) who ran around left end for 17 yards and the only touchdown of the game. 
Diagram 1-7: KF-79. 

The misdirection of KF-79 killed the giant, as Lou Little cemented his place in 
football lore. The Delaware Wing-T enjoys the capability of misdirection and has no 
less power of deception than the precisely executed KF-79. Because the Wing-T is a 
four-back offense, misdirection may be used to great extent and with maximum

he single wing attack. Defenders playing in a defensive scheme which focuses on 
aving players read both the backfield angles and the blocking schemes will 
certainly face conflict. The criss-crossing action of the backs and the pulling 
linemen, coupled with the ball hiding action of the quarterback and the backs, and 
make a defender dizzy. 
Defensive conflicts can also be created with the use of motion. Misdirection is 
enhanced when the offense attacks the defense away from the motion. Attacking a 
defense opposite the direction of motion is best achieved by having the quarterback 
keep the ball outside after faking to the dive back (Diagram 1-8). Using identical 
backfield action as shown in Diagram 1-9, the system can attack off-tackle opposite 
the motion flow with the halfback. In Diagram 1-10, the motion man carries the ball 
between the tackles while the faking fullback provides misdirection.

trap, the tackle must squeeze inside toward the ball. However, if he reacts properly 
to the down block of the tackle, he is vulnerable to the tight end’s down block

block in order to better play the tight end, he would open up the inside for the 
fullback. As such, the defensive tackle Is in conflict.

makes It vulnerable to the weakside. The wingback alignment tends to widen the 
eight-man front making it vulnerable off-tackle and between the tackles. The 
three-deep secondary scheme must tighten its alignment and play man-to-man 
principle in order to get adequate support on the perimeter. A three-deep secondary 
which moves to a man-to-man coverage alignment on the wingback becomes 
extremely vulnerable to the weakside running game. 
The Wing-T also benefits from an option attack. The Wing-T has the option

weapons to attack the outflanked defensive perimeter. Threatening the defensive 
flank adds a third dimension for the defensive front to consider and provides an 
aspect of misdirection that is nonexistent in some offensive systems. Meanwhile, 
the defense must also consider the Wing-T flank attack from the waggle and the 
keep-pass series with the quarterback moving off the line of scrimmage. 
Formations create angles. The Wing T formation SUSIE supports this. 
statement,

it 

These five flanks are available through every formation in the Delaware Wing-T 
system. When selecting a defensive point to attack, the Wing-T coach first looks at 
the offensive strong flank. The Wing-T coach evaluates the defensive alignment to 
the formation strength and assesses if the defensive adjustment to the wing is an 
effective adjustment. The bottom line is whether the defense is meeting the 
offensive strength with defensive strength. Among the factors which the Wing-T 
coach should notice are: 
e 
How close is number four to the flank? 
e 
Has number three adjusted to the wing? 
e 
Whatis the level of commitment of number three to sealing the play inside? 
e 
Whowill contain the flank on the perimeter? 
e 
|s ball action a factor for the flank containment on the perimeter—does the 
three deep roll up, does the four deep invert? 
e 
What is the defensive adjustment to the end over side? 
e 
How does the defense respond to motion toward a particular flank? 
¢ 
How does the defense respond to motion away from a particular flank? 
The Wing-T coach looks for defenders who have dual responsibilities. The nature of 
the Wing-T is to confront these dual responsibility defenders with two options. 
When the defender chooses a particular reaction option, he is placed in conflict. The 
Wing-T coach plans the attack so that either choice the defender makes places the 
defender in conflict. If the defender reacts to stop the trap, he places himself in 
jeopardy for a companion play to the trap. If the defender reacts to stop the sweep, 
he places himself in jeopardy for a companion play to the sweep. The point to 
remember is that defensive conflict leads to offensive success. 
The Wing-T coach obviously directs the flow of attack toward the offensive flank, 
which presents the most advantageous angle to place pressure on the opposing 
defensive flank. A successful Wing-T plan will have only a handful of plays.tn the 
Delaware Wing-T system, this handful of plays is referred to as primary plays. All 
other plays in the successful Wing-T game plan are extensions from the threat of 
the primary plays. The primary plays must be established (i.e., run successfully ) in 
order for any other extension play to succeed. 
Three main points of attack exist on each side of the center against any defense: 
between the tackles: off-tackle; and on the perimeter. A play which attacks

GROUND ORIENTED 
The objective of offensive football is to move the ball and score. Every coach is 
confronted with the question of how this objective can be most efficiently 
accomplished. The conception of any football system must begin with deciding 
whether the attack will be primarily a running attack or a passing attack. A good 
coach realizes the best offensive strategy strikes a chord of balance between 
running and passing. However, the threat of balance is often the medium through 
which the one-sided attack succeeds. 
Because of limited practice time, an offensive strategy must generally favor one 
style of attack. The Delaware Wing-T is a ground-oriented attack. The basic 
reasons the Delaware Wing-T philosophy favors the running game phase include: 
e 
The core of any football team is hardness. On a football team there is no real 
separation of offense from defense. The development of a grueling ground 
game such as the Delaware Wing-T builds a desire to physically dominate the 
opponent. A physical offensive style of play supports and promotes a physical 
style of defensive play. The result of the Wing-T offense is a physical style of 
team play, both offensively and defensively. As a result, the style of the 
offense and how the ball is moved takes on greater significance. 
¢ 
During the football game, each team will get the ball between ten and fifteen 
times. The team which controls the ball through low-risk, positive-yardage 
plays decreases the opponent's number of opportunities to have the ball. The 
Wing-T is such a ball-control offense. 
e 
consistent ground game increases the number of offensive opportunities to 
enter the red zone or the four-down area. 
e 
Severe weather or adverse field conditions do not negatively affect the Wing-T 
ground attack. Severe weather conditions often handicap passing attacks and 
other offensive running styles of attack. 
° 
The Wing-T running attack is not as dependent on the standout ability of one 
or two players. The pro passing attack is heavily dependent upon the skill of 
the quarterback and his receivers, while many other running styles are 
dependent upon a showcase running back. Because the Wing-T running game 
shares the wealth between its running backs, it is not overly dependent on a 
single offensive star.

Offensive Communication and Structure 
The numbering system used in the Delaware Wing- -T system to communicate the 
necessar PRE ey for the execution an 
a play is a three- “digit pune ng system. 
first digit Menitiest e formation, the second digit identifies the co series, and 
the third digit identifies the point of attack. The three-digit number may be 
preceded by a term. The term preceding the formation alters the formation 
structure. A term which follows the three-digit number modifies the play. 
The numbering scheme progresses right to left, the value of the numbers increasing 
from 1 to 9. The number 1 designates the far right; the number 9 designates the far 
left. The number 5 corresponds to the location of the center. Thus, the numbers 1 
through 4 are right-handed numbers. A formation number beginning with a number 
less than 5 is a right-handed formation. A play to the numbered holes 1 through 4 
hits the right side of the center. A formation number beginning with a number 
greater than 5 is a left-handed formation. A play to the numbered holes 6 through 3 
hits to the left of the center. The numbers 1-4 are synonymous with the word, right. 
The numbers 6-9 are synonymous with the word, left.

Formations may be adjusted with extended motion. Two types of extended motion 
in the Wing-T system—wingback motion and diveback motion. Wingback motion is 
called “run to.” “Run to” directs the wingback to run toward the ball and across the 
formation. The wingback runs between the quarterback and the fullback on the “run 
to” motion. “Run away” directs the wingback to run away from the ball, out from 
the formation. The “run away” call makes a pro formation from a wing formation. 
Another wingback motion is called “M" motion. “M" tells the wingback to short 
motion to the near diveback alignment. The wingback then executes his play 
assignment. The most disruptive motion to the defense is “2” motion. A “2” motion 
call tells the wingback to motion opposite the play direction using the “M" 
technique. "Z” also tells the other back who is not carrying the ball to reverse the 
direction of his responsibility. “Z” motion is usually used on the fullback plays. 
Diveback motion is called “motion to.” On “motion to,” the diveback runs the motion 
toward the ball and across the formation. He passes between the quarterback and 
fullback. On “motion away” the diveback goes in motion away from the ball, out 
from the formation.

BACKFIELD SERIES 
The second digit in the three-digit call identifies the series. A series is a backfield 
pattern of movements. Several plays are available in each series. Each series Is 
identified by certain characteristics. Nine series are used in the Delaware Wing-T 
system. Each series may be run toward or away from the wing.

The check cadence is also used rhythmically to select a play at the line of 
scrimmage. 
Previously, all shifting or extended motion at Delaware University began with the 
word “set.” Our philosophy did not favor the quarterback balancing on one foot to 
put the motion in effect. As all successful coaches realize, however, a winning 
philosophy must constantly be reevaluated and reassessed. In recent years, the 
Delaware staff has adjusted the cadence system. Our philosophy has been

a common foot movement, 
se cannot cue on arhythmic cadence 
the ball game 
d long 
fense from “booking” the snap count (i.e., anticipating the 
irse 
of 
counts to prevent the de 

snap). The Delaware philosophy favors the use of the nonrhythmic short count. The 
nonrhythmic snap count on the first sound facilitates the quickest possible takeoff 
for the offensive linemen while also preventing the defense from booking the snap 
count. 
The old version of the check cadence used at Delaware entailed the quarterback 
specifying one of the companion plays by calling “even set” or “odd set.” In the 
huddle, the quarterback called the companion plays and said “check cadence.” For 
example, the quarterback in the huddle called “121 or 129—check cadence.” “Even 
set” identified the play to be run as the right-handed play. In the example above, 
“even set” alerts the team to run 121, the right-handed play, while “odd set” alerts 
the team to run 129, the left-handed play. “Even set” always designated the right- 
handed play; “odd set” always designated the left-handed play. 
In recent years, the quarterback changes the play at the line of scrimmage by 
calling a play in the huddle. Since the Delaware method of offensive installation is 
the installation of a play in companion with its mirror play, the players are familiar 
with the companion of each play. This familiarity allows brevity to be the order in 
the huddle. The quarterback need only call the primary play in the huddle. An 
example of this type of huddle call is “right 121 on the ball—check cadence.” Once 
the quarterback evaluates the defensive strength to the primary flank, he knows if 
he should audible the play. If the defensive left flank is strong after the huddle call 
of “right 121-check cadence,” the quarterback will call ” 129, 129 check—even set.” 
The ball is snapped on “set” and the team runs 129 instead of 121. 
The cadence after the word “check” is a matter of game planning and may vary 
week to week. One week the cadence may be on one, “even set.” The next week 
the cadence may be on sound. The quarterback may start a check cadence in any 
manner 
he wishes and may 
identify 
the 
play through the aforementioned me

anticipate the “set” because it is usually nonrhythmic, he should be tensed to start 
the snapping motion on the “s” sound. The center cannot wait for the “t” sound to 
snap the ball. It should be noted that the count is sharply called. “Set” is not drawn 
out. The advantage of the snap coaching point is small. However, successful 
coaches use all available advantages, no matter how small, in order to gain large

On the keep pass called pattern, the patterns are called. The keep pass with called 
patterns is used when the Wing-T coach wants the keep pass play with other route 
options for the tight end and wingback. 
The waggle and bootleg both threaten the flank of the defense with the 
quarterback. As stated earlier in this text, the difference between a waggle and a 
bootleg is the line blocking assignment. On the bootleg, the linemen block as they 
would for the play being faked. On the waggle, the guards pull in the direction of the 
quarterback action. The waggle is run from the 20, 60, and 80 series. Both guards 
pull on the 20 series waggle.

A Study of Defense 
The Delaware Wing-T offensive system numbers the defensive men in order to 
identify their defensive assignments. The numbering system helps our quarterback 
read and recognize defenses and gives the coaches and players a method of 
communication during both practice and games. 
The coach begins by counting the first defensive man from the center's attack side 
gap. He continues to count toward the flank. The first two defenders are 
responsible for the interior seams and will take the dive on the option. The third man 
from the center's attack side gap is considered to be the contain of that flank. The 
fourth man from the center's attack side gap is considered to be the force of that 
flank. The force is responsible for the pitch versus option and also is usually 
assigned to cover the flat on a pass play. The fifth man is responsible for the deep 
zone against play action patterns. The sixth man is identified as responsible for 
pursult. 
Defensive assignments may vary from these identifications. However, when facing 
the option, the first two men work together to take the first threat, the number 
three man will have the quarterback and the number four man will have the pitch. 
Defensive assignments may be altered by a defensive stunt. The defensive 
assignments may also be altered by the flow of the defensive unit on a particular 
play. Nevertheless, counting to identify the defensive assignments on the attack 
side is an effective technique in teaching defense recognition. Linebackers and 
secondary personnel are referred to as “mirror men.” This designation means that 
they will mirror the position or action of the ball. Mirror men drop when the 
quarterback drops. Mirror men also roll or rotate to one side when the defensive 
flank is threatened. When mirror men rotate to the flank, they are forced to declare 
their responsibility of contain, pitch, or flat. 
Three categories of defenses exist: 
e 
The eight-man front with a three-deep coverage scheme. 
e 
The seven-man front with a four-deep coverage scheme. 
e 
Anunbalanced defense created by the rotation of the four-deep coverage 
scheme or the shift of the three-deep coverage scheme.

Man-to-man coverage principle provides faster run support against a wing-down 
block than does zone-coverage principle. If the Wing-T coach notices aggressive 
Support on the perimeter against the play, 121 Down, the coach should suspect a 
man-to-man coverage. The reaction of the perimeter support is an accurate 
indicator of the principle coverage. Hard, aggressive run support from a zone 
alignment probably means the coverage Is a man-to-man coverage disguised as a 
zone. When man-to-man coverage on the wingback is recognized, the coach can 
attack the wing flank with 121 Release or 182 Down, with the wing releasing. If 
number four is playing man to man on the wing, releasing the wing will place number 
four in conflict. If the wing releases, number four will not aggressively force the 
perimeter if he is man to man on the wing. Number four must respect the outside 
release of the wing in man-to-man coverage. Releasing the wing will also widen the 
zone player with man principles. Many secondary schemes teach the zone player to 
read the tightly aligned receiver instead of the ball. Indeed, this strategy is good 
against the Delaware Wing-T because of the indecision caused by the misdirection 
in the backfield. The defensive coach expects the zone player to read the wing or 
the tight end to get a faster and more accurate run-pass key. Releasing the wing 
places the player using this technique in conflict. He must widen to cover his zone as 
the wingback releases. 
If he doesn't widen, the play action pass to the flat is open. If he does widen to 
cover his zone, the defensive flank is vulnerable as the edge is softened. The 
defensive end, number three, is placed in conflict against the tight end down block 
and wingback release. If the tight end blocks down, the end must squeeze with the 
tight end to close the off-tackle area. The guard now has an opportunity to seal the 
defensive end as the quarterback attacks the flank on 182 Down Option. 
A cursory glance at the defensive alignment can never answer all the questions 
about the defensive responsibilities. The Wing-T coach must acquire information 
with each play. The quarterback can test the offside defensive reaction with a 
bootleg action. The reaction of the free safety to the quarterback bootleg action Is 
notable in evaluating the defensive flow to the attack side. The Wing-T attack 
must force the four-deep weak safety to rotate to the middle of the field on flow. In 
addition, the three-deep free safety must be forced to rotate to the wing on flow. 
Once the safety rotates, the play action passing game, specifically the waggle, is 
open away from the wing. A coach doesn't have to be a football genius to 
understand that he should not run to the wing if the defense has made a sound wing 
adjustment. As Woody Hayes said, “Don't attack walled cities.” Once the 
assessment is made determining where the defense is sound against the offensive 
strength, the Wing-T coach directs his attention to the opposite flank. In evaluating 
the opposite flank, the coach should answer the following questions: 
e 
Has the secondary pre-rotated to the wing? 

b oheatle 
ee ae Coe ae ae ee ee 
ee et ee eae ee a a ee 
e 
ls the spread end isolated against a single defender who has no help? 
e 
ls the secondary using corner support or invert safety support on the flank? 
e 
From what angle is number four supporting? 
e 
How fast can number four support? 
e 
What is the position of number three? 
The Wing-T coach begins the attack on the opposite flank with motion. The first 
series the coach considers is the option attack—either the belly option or trap 
option to the spread end. The position of number three is critical. Number three has 
more freedom when the spread end is aligned to his side. If number three crosses 
the line of scrimmage to take the quarterback, number three should be “loaded.” 
Loading a defender means the halfback will block him to free up the quarterback on 
the option. A load-blocking halfback on the option provides the quarterback an 
excellent opportunity to run free on the flank. A reduced front (i.e. a front moved 
toward the tight end side) can be flanked with motion and a buck sweep to the 
spread end. 
Upon motioning toward and attacking the spread end flank, the Wing-T coach 
determines the number four defender's support angle. If number four is supporting 
from a cornerback position in the four-deep scheme, the spread end releases outside 
of number four. Releasing outside stretches the cornerback and makes it difficult 
for him to support and squeeze the alley. If the safety inverts to provide the primary 
force support, the spread end cracks back on the safety. Inverted support is also 
vulnerable to the option pass and belly keep pass. Full secondary rotation to the 
motion dictates that the Wing-T coach go to the waggle and hit the tight end to 
exploit the rotation. If the secondary effectively stops the spread-flank attack with 
fast flow to the motion, the Wing-T coach should counter by running to the spread 
flank without motion. 
ATTACKING THE SEVEN-MAN FRONT 
Off-Tackle 
The number three defender must close with the tight-end down block. He also must 
contain when aligned to the spread end side. Against the seven-man front, the tight 
end seldom has an inside gap defender denying the tight end leverage to block the 
number two man inside. The Wing-T coach should use belly action to determine 
number three’s assignment. If number three does not squeeze versus the tight end 
down block and ignores the fullback hitting the “C” gap, the belly down (182 down) 
is an excellent play. If number three closes with the tight end and attacks the 
fullback in the “C” gap, 182 Down Option will take advantage of his reaction.

philosophy because of the limited need for adjustments. 
The eight-man front and three-deep scheme is capable of making a “roll up” 
adjustment to flow. The roll up adjustment adjusts the three-deep zone to a two- 
deep zone as the cornerback on the attack side rolls up into the flat. By rolling up, 
the cornerback frees the number four man, the strong safety, to play more 
aggressively on the flank. The middle safety rolls over the top to cover the deep 
half of the field behind the cornerback.

The Wing-T coach attacks the eight-man front by adjusting the split of the ends. If 
the defensive end aligns at an inside shade, the tight end may flex up to a distance 
of six feet. The widening of the tight end’s split forces number three to make an 
alignment adjustment. The defensive end must declare his gap either by moving 
inside against the flex or moving out to align on the tight end. If number three moves 
inside the tight end, the Wing-T coach attacks the alignment as he would attack 
the sevén-man front, four-deep defense, running the 20 series and the 80 down 
option. The quarterback should be trained to favor the keep rather than look to 
pitch since the number four defender is usually the force (the force having pitch 
responsibility as his option priority). The number three defender is placed under 
tremendous pressure as he attempts to control the fullback off the edge and take 
the quarterback on the option. The most common result in this series of events is 
the seam opening off-tackle for the fullback as number three becomes more 
quarterback conscious on the belly series. If this result occurs, the Wing-T coach 
must use the fullback to drive the ball inside of the number three defender.

The companion offensive strategy to the tight end flex is to.cut the spread end's

If the secondary is not rolling over the top, the strong safety is in conflict, having to 
force the run on the perimeter and cover the flat against play action toward his 
position. This concept of attacking the three deep applies to the wing side as well 
as the spread side. 
ATTACKING THE EIGHT-MAN FRONT 
Off-Tackle 
Against any defense, there are only three places to run. Against the balanced eight- 
man front, the place to run is off-tackle. The off-tackle attack complements the 
perimeter attack. The Wing-T coach first determines the alignment and 
responsibility of number three. The defensive play of number three determines 
whether the attack should be made inside or outside. To test number three, the 
coach uses a successful outside play as his experimental control. For example, if 121 
has been successful, 122 Gut will be a good companion play. The number three 
defender will begin to ignore the down block of the tight end on 121, attacking the 
wing to his outside in order to help stop the perimeter play. 
Diagram 5-25: 121. 
Once the number three defender is seen widening on 121, the immediate response 
must be to run 122 Gut. The wingback influences the number three defender and 
continues on to the next level of defenders and walls off the inside linebacker. The 
attack side guard pulls up into the line of scrimmage in a gut block technique, and 
the backside guard pulls to kick out number three. If number three is extremely 
conscious of the tight end’s block, a gut release is a good strategy. The tight end 
releases, widening the end for the 122 Gut.

The center is firing off the ball as he snaps. If the quarterback doesn't follow 
through on the snap, the center's blocking motion will create a gap between the 
quarterback’s hands and the center's buttocks, thereby resulting in a poor exchange. 
Exchanges should be practiced daily with the companion center blocking straight 
ahead, angling right and left and zoning right and left. Dummies should be placed on 
the center's nose to simulate the 50 defensive nose tackle. The quarterback always 
tzers. Many times, either the center or quarterback will lose his composure in 
such an instance. Accordingly, goal-line gap situation snaps and linebacker blitz 
snaps should be practiced to prevent a needless turnover in the big game.

QUARTERBACK MECHANICS ON THE BELLY 
On the belly to the right from the 900 formation (983), the quarterback pushes off 
his right foot and opens with his left foot to the midline. This action is a reverse- 
pivot, because the quarterback pivots in the opposite direction from the direction of 
the play. As the left foot hits the mid-line, he drives his right knee across his body to 
a point just across the midline. Many coaches use an imaginary clock face to teach 
the landmarks for the quarterback steps. 
Diagram 6-2: Clock chart. 

Oe? Ga ay eee nee ay ee 
ee ae 
ee ee ee 
Using the clock face method, the quarterback faces the high noon position of 12 
o'clock as he seats the ball. His pivot step with his left foot on 983 lands at 6 
o'clock. The right follow step across the midline lands at 5 o'clock. As the 
quarterback makes the 5 o'clock step, he uses both hands to place the ball firmly 
into the fullback’s belly. At that point, the ride begins. The third quarterback step 
with his left foot on 983 slides into the line of scrimmage parallel to the path of the 
fullback. The ride continues, and the handoff is made. The quarterback extends the 
ride and executes the handoff by quickly sliding the right hand out of the mesh 
point. 
The mesh is the point at which the quarterback and the fullback share control of 
the ball. On 983, the right hand is between the ball and the fullback’s belly. As the 
right hand is drawn from the ride, the left hand presses the ball into the fullback’s 
belly. The right foot slides with the ride of the fullback, allowing the quarterback to 
gather his feet. The quarterback takes care to slide with the ride. The slide of the 
back foot extends the ride and creates more deception. Moving with the fullback on 
the ride keeps the quarterback from getting off balance and allows him to keep the 
ball position at his navel. Maintaining center on the ball decreases the incidence of 
poor quarterback-fullback exchanges. Failing to ride the fullback sometimes results 
in leaving the ball on the hip of the fullback, a common cause of fumbles on the 
belly play. After the quarterback pulls the hands from the pocket of the fullback, he 
pushes off the foot nearest the line of scrimmage (the left foot on 983) and comes 
off the ride at his original depth while snapping his hands to his back hip and moving 
to fake the keep pass. 
QUARTERBACK MECHANICS FOR THE BUCK SWEEP 
The buck sweep to the right from the 100 formation is called 121. When running 121, 
the quarterback pushes off the right foot and reverse pivots. The left foot is placed 
at the midline (6 o'clock). The right foct follows to the midline near 6 o'clock and 
the quarterback finishes the pivot with his back to the line of scrimmage. The 
fullback hits close to the quarterback but yields the right of way to the quarterback 
as he pivots. The ball stays seated and is not presented to the fullback. The speed 
of the fullback and the proximity of his path to the quarterback sell the fake. 
Opinions differ among Wing-T coaches as to whether the quarterback should give 
the ball to the halfback on the quarterback's second step at 180 degrees or his third 
step. The Delaware system has the quarterback reverse pivot and two-step, giving 
the ball on the third step. For example, on 21, the quarterback pushes off the right 
foot and pivots to the midline. He follows the one step pivot with a right foot step 
to 6 o'clock. He hands the ball off on the third step, a left foot at 6 o'clock. Other 
successful systems use the two-step method and have the quarterback hand off 
the ball on the right foot step. Each method of footwork allows for specific 
advantages.

SCAG 
After the fullback clears and the quarterback has completed the 180 degree reverse 
pivot, the quarterback slide steps to his left and presents the ball into the left 
halfback’s pocket. The ball is placed into the halfback’s pocket with a quick snap. 
The quarterback takes care to maintain proper spacing to the halfback and reaches 
to present the ball to the halfback from approximately 12 inches away. Once the ball 
is presented in the pocket, the quarterback and the halfback close to a point where 
their shoulders brush. Thus, the handoff to the halfback is made in a closing fashion. 
Upon completion of the handoff, the quarterback is closer to the halfback than he 
was at the initial mesh for the handoff. 
The quarterback turns his head toward the halfback as the halfback passes the 
mesh. Turning the head accomplishes two things. First, it allows the quarterback to 
recover the ball should a fumble occur at the mesh. Second, turning the head keeps 
the quarterback mechanics consistent to the waggle. The quarterback turns his 
head to look at the back on the waggle to sell the buck sweep fake. After checking 
the halfback, the quarterback follows the handoff by faking a bootleg at a depth of 
four to six yards off the line of scrimmage. When faking the bootleg, the 
quarterback takes notice of the free safety’s response to the buck sweep. 
Identifying the action of the free safety helps the quarterback read the free safety 
when the waggle is called. 
QUARTERBACK MECHANICS ON THE FULLBACK TRAP 
The fullback trap is run from the 20 series. Whether the play is trap blocked or not 
trap blocked is of no consequence to the quarterback mechanics on the 24 and 26 
play sequence. The 124 Guard Trap, the 124 On, and the 124 Gut differ from the buck 
sweep. Although the action is identical, the coaching points are different for the 
fullback and quarterback. 
Most important of the coaching points is the defensive front alignment. If a nose 
man is on the center, the quarterback reverse pivots past the mid-line. On 124, the 
quarterback reverse pivots placing his foot at the 5 o'clock point. Pivoting past the 
midline on the opening step opens the hips of the quarterback and provides 
clearance for the fullback. Unlike the buck sweep series, the fullback has the right 
of way on the 24 and 26 plays. The quarterback’s pivot past the mid-line allows the 
fullback to hit the right hip of the center on 24 versus an odd front. 
When facing an even defensive front, the quarterback pivots to the midline, opening 
to 6 o'clock. The quarterback’s hips do not open as much as when facing the odd 
front. Opening past the midline is not necessary against the even front because the 
fullback hits the left hip on 124. The fullback hits the right hip on 126 versus an even 
front. A critical coaching point is the fact that the seating of the ball by the 
- 
quarterback is vitally important to the 24 and 26 plays. Seating the ball properly 
helps to hide the ball from the linebackers. The ball is popped into the fullback’s 

ee eee ee ee 
eee ee 
pocket as the quarterback follows his opening step with his push foot. The 
quarterback fakes the buck sweep handoff to the halfback and then continues ona 
bootleg path. A common error of the quarterback is to let the back hand drag after 
the handoff. The quarterback must snap the hands back to the belt on the handoff 
to gather and fake to the halfback. Quick hands are important for the quarterback’s 
execution of the 24 and 26 plays. 
QUARTERBACK MECHANICS ON THE WAGGLE 
The waggle gives the quarterback the option to keep the ball around the defensive 
flank or pass the ball. The waggle is an excellent play to take advantage of the 
flow of the defense to the buck sweep. If the free safety becomes aggressively 
involved in the running game, the waggle can be used to take advantage of his 
aggressiveness. The coaching points of the fullback fake on the waggle are the 
same as the coaching points on the buck sweep. The action of the fullback passing 
the quarterback is the principal fake; the ball is not faked to the fullback. 
Two methods of faking—the one-handed fake and the two-handed ball fake. On the 
one-handed fake of the 129 Waggle, the quarterback gives his right hand to the 
halfback running the buck sweep fake. As the quarterback gives him his hand, the 
quarterback cradles the ball in his belly with his left hand. The two-handed fake Is a 
safer fake and hides the ball just as effectively. On the two-handed fake, the ball is 
hidden by the quarterback’s body, and the responsibility of the fake belongs to the 
halfback. The quarterback settles on a simulated ride and then turns his head to the 
passing halfback to direct the defensive attention toward the halfback. The 
quarterback should make turning his head to the fake a habit. Many coaches have 
the quarterback snap his head over his outside shoulder to check for pressure on the 
edge. The Wing-T quarterback’s major priority should be to sell the fake because 
success in the Wing-T depends on the faking ability of the quarterback. 
On the one-handed fake, the left hand flows with the fake, and the quarterback 
pushes off the fake and gets his head around to find the pressure on the edge. 
Normally, when running the waggle to the tight end, as with 129 Waggle, no threat 
of pressure on the edge exists. In this case, the quarterback immediately looks for 
the free safety. On the short side waggle, such as 121 Waggle, the pressure may be 
upfield hard. If the pressure is upfield hard, the quarterback ducks under as he finds 
the free safety. If the pressure is nonexistent (i.e., meaning the defender went with 
the fake), the quarterback attacks the flank as he finds the free safety. If the free 
safety flows with the halfback fake, the quarterback may hit the tight end in the 
seam. Technically, the quarterback has three options if the free safety is out of 
position. The quarterback may run the ball, dump it to the fullback in the flat, or hit 
the tight end in the middle of the field. If the free safety stays in the middle of the 
field and covers the tight end, the quarterback hits the crossing halfback. The 129

Waggle is run to the tight end side, rather than the split end side, which is more 
common. Because of its logistics, the tight end waggle presents a good opportunity 
for the quarterback to keep the ball rather than throw It. 
Diagram 6-3: 129 Waggle. 
QUARTERBACK MECHANICS ON THE TACKLE TRAP 
Once again, the quarterback reads the defensive alignment. If a defensive man is on 
the center, the quarterback pivots to the midline. On 134 Counter Trap, the 
quarterback pushes off his left foot and opens with his right foot landing on the 
midline. Versus an even defense (no nose man), the right foot steps just across the 
midline. Stepping across the midline allows the left halfback to stay close to the 
double team block. Just as the fullback clears, the quarterback bends his path 
toward the mesh point. The quarterback pops the ball at forearm length into the 
pocket formed by the left halfback. The quarterback then snaps both hands back 
and puts them on his back hip as he fakes the bootleg at a depth from four to six 
yards. The bootleg is no deeper than six yards in order to place pressure on the 
defensive end.

BELLY KEEP PASS 
The quarterback reverse pivots 180 degrees flat and fast on the Belly Down and the 
Belly Option. On 182 Down and 981 Option, the quarterback pushes off his right foot 
and pivots past the midline, coming to a position with his back to the line of 
scrimmage. On the Belly Down (Diagram 6-4), the quarterback 
jabs the ball into the 
fullback’s belly pocket on his second step. The quarterback then fakes the Belly 
Option after coming off the fullback ride and handoff.

On the Belly Option (Diagram 6-5), the quarterback ensures he has a passing grip 
when seating the ball and disengaging from the fullback after the ride. As the 
quarterback disengages from the fullback, the quarterback moves quickly upfield to 
attack the inside foot of number 3. Once 3 makes a commitment, the quarterback 
reacts by keeping the ball or pitching to the left halfback. 
The Belly Keep Pass footwork is the same as the belly and Belly Option with one 
exception. The quarterback pivots slightly flatter to enable the quarterback to get 
to the flank quicker. An important coaching point of the Belly Keep Pass (Diagram 6- 
6) is to ensure that the quarterback releases the ball quickly off the fake. The Belly 
Keep Pass allows the quarterback the choice of running or passing. 
Diagram 6-6: 182 Keep Pass. 
QUARTERBACK MECHANICS ON THE TRAP OPTION 
On 921 Trap Option (a trap option to the right), the quarterback pushes off his right 
foot to reverse pivot and steps on the midline with his left foot. The second step 
with the right foot also hits the midline as the quarterback settles at a 180-degree 
pivot. The pivot steps are short and controlled. On the third step, the quarterback's 
left foot points to the inside foot of the number 3 defender. Pointing the toe enables 
the quarterback to get up into the line of scrimmage to execute the option. The 
quarterback then keeps the ball or pitches to the left halfback.

The Delaware Wing-T Running Backs 
A positive feature of the Wing-T is the shared responsibility of the running backs in 
the offense. To ensure offensive success, the running backs must master the skill of 
carrying the ball as well as catching the ball, blocking and faking. There are two 
basic positions in the backfield—fullback and halfback. The halfback position is 
divided into two assignments—wingback and diveback. The techniques required for 
the fullback, diveback and wingback positions are consistent throughout the 
offense. The following coaching points apply to all three positions. 
STANCE 
The running backs use a two-point stance. A two-point stance enables the backs to 
move laterally and straight ahead with the same efficiency. The precision of the 
play execution is enhanced because the running back can more easily see the 
defensive spacing and available seams. The two-point stance gives the running back 
an advantage in anticipating the hole opening. 
SHOULDER BLOCK 
The predominant blocking style of the Wing-T is the shoulder block. The shoulder is 
the only padded area of the body which may be used to legally strike a blow to the 
opponent. Using the shoulder as the principal blocking surface allows the blocker to 
explode and sustain contact. The blocker who uses the correct shoulder block 
technique keeps the top of his shoulders slightly higher than his hips and parallel to 
the ground. The head is kept up, while his neck is bowed. 
The traditional shoulder block style is to close the fist, flex the elbow, and bring the 
contact fist across the chest. If a blocker is shoulder blocking with his right 
shoulder, the blocker flexes his right arm and brings his right fist across his chest. 
The right elbow is raised to increase the blocking surface. A good blocking surface 
locks the defender in the crease of the shoulder and neck. The traditional shoulder 
block technique is still the safest, simplest, and most effective blocking technique, 
particularly on an angle block. The coaching points of the shoulder block are 
adjusted as it relates to each position.

Re ee Oe 
ae a Mle 
For example, the diveback drives five yards before coming under control to execute 
the shoulder block. The wingback steps with his inside foot and shoulder blocks 
with his head in front of the defender, blocking with his outside shoulder. The 
wingback finishes his block by shooting his inside hand to the ground and whipping 
his outside leg into the defender. 
TAKEOFF 
The running back must be proficient at taking off in three directions: straight ahead, 
right, and left. The running back must also be proficient at 45-degree takeoffs to 
the right and the left. As with any football position, his weight should be placed on 
a push foot. The push foot is usually the foot opposite the direction the player 
wants to move. Running backs must learn to focus their weight on a push foot. 
Focusing on a push foot eliminates false stepping. On a crossover, the push foot is 
the foot toward the side to which the player moves. In the Delaware Wing-T 
system, the running back uses a crossover step to move left or right. When using a 
crossover step, the stance should be slightly wider than the shoulders. The 
opposite arm is thrown tightly across the chest, bringing the opposite shoulder 
under the chin. The snapping of the arm across the body gets the hips to rotate and 
aids the execution of the crossover step. The 45-degree step is alead step, not a 
crossover step. The push foot of the lead step is the opposite foot as the back 
takes a short lead step at 45 degrees toward the aiming point. The wingback three- 
step motion requires the player to open his hips as he bucket steps with his inside 
foot. The inside foot is then pointed at one of two appropriate landmarks. The first 
landmark is the outside foot of the normal diveback position. The other landmark is 
the inside foot of the normal diveback position. The wingback three-step motions to 
the outside foot landmark when motioning for a handoff or handoff fake. The 
wingback three-step motions to the inside foot when motioning for any play action 
pass or option. 
FORMING A HANDOFF POCKET 
To receive the ball from the quarterback, the halfback anchors his outside hand on 
his inside hip with the palm up and fingers hyperextended. The other hand is placed 
across the chest just below the opposite bicep with the palms facing downward and 
the fingers flexed to 90 degrees. The quarterback executes a one-handed handoff, 
placing the ball into the halfback’s belly at forearm’s length and feathering the ball 
by rolling the top hand over the top. This handoff enables the quarterback and the 
halfback to get very close to each other and increases the deception of the play. 
The fullback handoff is a two-handed handoff. The fullback makes a pocket by 
raising his near elbow to position his arm high across the chest, pronating the thumb 
toward the chest. The opposite arm is placed across the abdomen with the elbow 
flexed to form an angle. The thumb of his lower hand is rotated away from his belly, 
flattening the palm and making the floor of the pocket while his fingers are spread 
and extended downward.

RUNNING BACK COACHING POINTS IN THE RUNNING GAME 
The running backs have two basic run game responsibilities—carrying the ball and 
blocking. The left halfback coaching points are described for the running plays 
discussed in this section. The right halfback has identical coaching points in the 
mirror formation and the plays named. The right halfback has exactly the same 
coaching points as the left halfback when the play is mirrored. The exception in 
mirrored coaching points is the obvious switch of left and right when describing 
movement. 
e 
 121—From the 100 formation, the left halfback carries the ball from the diveback 
position. He crosses over and runs through the fullback’s starting position. The 
halfback receives the handoff on the second step and reads the right halfback’s 
block. The left halfback sells the read to the defense that he is attempting to 
get around the flank. The preferred cut is under the overpursuing defense. The 
number four man will attempt to provide containment if the ball carrier appears 
to threaten the perimeter. Once number four flies upfield to desperately contain 
the play, the back cuts under the kickout block and hits the alley between the 
wall-blocking guard and the kick-out block. Upon exiting the alley into the 
broken field, the ball carrier cuts behind the overpursuing free safety as the 
backside tackle crosses the field and blindsides the free safety. Once the 
backside tackle clears the backside guard area, he flattens to cross the field 
and search for the free safety. If the free safety is attempting to fill the alley, 
the tackle earholes the free safety, and the ball carrier cuts to the middle. The 
big play on the buck sweep is against the grain. The mirrored play for the right 
halfback is 929. 
Diagram 7-1: 121.

921—The left halfback aligns as the left wing in the 900 formation. He three- 
step motions to a point corresponding to the outside foot of his diveback 
position. Using the same mechanics of the left diveback position, the left 
halfback takes the handoff and runs the 921 sweep in the same manner as the 
121 sweep. The mirrored play for the right halfback is 129. 
Diagram 7-2: 921. 
182 Down Option—From the diveback position of the 100 formation, the left 
halfback leaves in a one-step motion to run off the tail of the fullback. The 
aiming point is five yards outside the tight end’s original alignment, two yards 
behind the line of scrimmage. This aiming point is the basic pitch relationship 
position on all option plays. After gaining pitch-relationship, the halfback 
mirrors the downfield path of the quarterback, maintaining a 4-yard cushion 
from the quarterback and trailing slightly behind the quarterback. The pitch is 
made outward to the trailing halfback. The halfback keeps his eyes on the 
quarterback at all times. Once the quarterback turns up, the halfback turns up. 
Once the quarterback breaks the line of scrimmage, the halfback keeps the 4- 
yard lateral cushion but now reverts to a 1-yard trail of the quarterback. By 
trailing instead of leading the downfield quarterback, the halfback allows the 
quarterback to make a legal pitch of the downfield threat. Pitching off a free 
safety is a dangerous maneuver, but it can pay off with a big play if the 
quarterback and halfback are disciplined in their duties and execute the 
downfield pitch. The mirrored play for the right halfback is $988 Down Option.

formation. Using a three-step motion, he aims for a point approximate to the 
inside foot of the diveback position. Once reaching the inside foot of the 
diveback position, the halfback continues to execute the down option to the 
right. The mirrored play for the right halfback is 189 Option Load.

Spread 121 Trap Option—The left halfback crosses over and runs through the 
fullback’s original alignment. The left halfback continues on the four-by-two 
pitch relationship described in the section on 182 Down Option. The mirrored 
play for the right halfback is Spread 929 Trap Option. 
Diagram 7-5: Spread 121 Trap Option.

921 Trap Option—The left halfback leaves the 900 left wingback alignment with 
three-step motion to the outside foot of the diveback position. Once the left 
halfback reaches the diveback position, he gains pitch relationship and 
continues, while observing his pitch-relationship coaching points described in 
the section on 182 Down Option. The mirrored play for the right halfback is 129 
Trap Option. 

e 
132 Normal Hole—The left halfback crosses over and attacks the outside leg of 
the 3 tackle. He takes an inside handoff (right elbow up, like a fullback). 132 
Normal Hole is run against a defense with a defensive tackle on the 3 tackle. 
The mirrored play for the right halfback is 938 Normal Hole. 
Diagram 7-7: 132 Normal Hole. 
e 
132 Short Hole—The left halfback crosses over for the outside foot of the 3 
tackle. He takes an inside handoff (the right elbow up, like a fullback). 132 Short 
Hole is run versus a defense with no defensive tackle aligned on the offensive 
— 
tackle. No defensive tackle aligned on the offensive tackle is indicative of an 
“even” front. Thus, the short hole is an even front adjustment to the 132 Normal 
Hole. The mirrored play for the right halfback is 938 Short Hole.

122 Gut—The left halfback crosses over. The aiming point is the inside leg of the 
tight end. The handoff is an inside handoff. The mirrored play for the right

933 Counter Criss Cross—The left halfback opens up with his right foot and 
gains one yard in depth. He receives the handoff from the right halfback over 
the outside foot of the 6 guard. The handoff is an inside handoff with the right 
elbow up. The aiming point is the tailbone of the 4 guard. The mirrored play for 
the right halfback is 137 Criss Cross. 
Diagram 7-11: 933 Counter Criss Cross. 
e 
134 Counter—The left halfback pushes off his left foot as he lead steps with 
his right foot. He gets the handoff on the next step and uses an aiming point 
which is front sensitive. His aiming point depends on the defensive front 
alignment. If the front is odd (i.e., has 
anose man), the left halfback aims for the 
tailbone of the center. He reads the center's block and makes a cut opposite the 
nose man’s gap control. If the defense is even (i.e., he does not have a nose man), 
the aiming point is the left foot of the center—a slightly tighter aiming point. 
Versus the odd front, the left halfback hugs the double team of the 4 guard and 
the center and cuts behind the tackle’s block on the linebacker. The mirrored 
play for the right halfback is 936 Counter.

934 Counter—The left halfback leaves in three-step motion for the outside foot 
of the diveback position. Once reaching the diveback position, the left halfback

the diveback position of the 100 formation. The mirrored play for the right 
halfback is 136 Counter.

For purposes of explanation, the blocking of the halfback is detailed using the right 
halfback position as an example. The left halfback has exactly the same coaching 
points as the right halfback when the play is mirrored. The exception in mirrored 
coaching points is the obvious switch of left and right when describing movement. 
121—The right wingback pushes off the outside foot and steps to the hip of the 
tight end. The blocking rule calls for the right halfback to block the first man 
inside. He is to stop defensive penetration by using an outside shoulder block 
technique. If the defender attempts to cross the blocker’s face to the outside, 
the right halfback shoots the inside hand to the ground and whips the outside 
leg into the outside hip of the defensive end. If the defender disappears inside 
the tight end’s block, the right halfback continues from the wingback position 
and blocks the next level. This type of reading block to the next level is called a 
read up. As he continues to the next level, the halfback should square his 
shoulders and drive his inside pad through the outside pad of a scraping 
linebacker. The alternate style of blocking the linebacker is to face up the 
linebacker and drive the shoulders under his chin, working to gain outside 
leverage. The mirrored play for the left halfback is 929. 
Diagram 7-14: 121. 
921—The right halfback aims for a spot two yards outside the offensive tackle. 
The halfback makes contact with his inside shoulder as he drives through the 
outside hip of the defender. He blocks the first man inside from the aiming point. 
The right halfback adjusts his aiming point as necessary in order to make 
contact with a defender leaking inside. The mirrored play for the left halfback Is

131—The right wingback drives off his outside foot to provide the leverage block 
ona tight-end-and-halfback-double team on the defensive end. From the 
wingback position, the halfback contacts the defender with his inside shoulder 
and provides the outside seal and lift of the double team on the defensive end. 
lf the defensive end disappears inside, the wingback squares his shoulders to go 
to the next level and attack the outside hip pad of the scraping linebacker (i.e., a 
read up). The wingback attacks the second level defender with the inside pad to 
the outside hip of linebacker. The mirrored play for the right halfback is 939.

981 Option—The right halfback arc releases to the outside foot of the spread 
end and reads the force support. If the secondary supports from an invert 
position, the halfback stalks number 5, the deep coverage corner. Stalking 
number 5 is only possible if number 4 is in a position off the line of scrimmage 
that enables him to be crack blocked by the spread end. If number 4 is on the 
line 
of scrimmage or is not aligned in a position of vulnerability to the crack 
back, the right halfback must arc release to a point outside the shoulder of 
number 4 and seal him inside. The right halfback may cut the outside thigh pad 
in the upper levels of play. National Federation rules or other rules which 
prohibit blocking below the waist require the halfback to use a shoulder block 
technique. The halfback may drive his inside shoulder to the chest of the 
defender and use his inside arm and hand to maintain contact on the defender. 
Many coaches believe arc blocking high is the more productive method of arc 
blocking on the force defender.

The fullback’s role in the Wing-T backfield is a large one. He blocks, fakes, and runs 
with the ball. The coaching points of the fullback’s duties on the staple plays are 
described in the following plays. 
e 
124 On, Guard Trap, Gut—Versus the odd front, the fullback aims for the tailbone 
of the center. He drives off the left foot and leads with the right foot. The 
fullback receives the handoff on the second step and cuts opposite the tail of 
the center. If the center swings his tail right, the center has gained leverage on 
the left side of the nose, to the center's right. The fullback cuts right if the tail 
swings right. If the tail swings left, the fullback cuts left. The fullback cuts to 
brush the hips of the center, staying tight to the block of the center. The 
fullback may also read the head of the nose man. If the nose man’s head 
appears over the left shoulder of the center, the fullback cuts to the right hip of 
the center. If the nose man’s head appears over the right shoulder of the center, 
the fullback cuts to the left hip of the center. 
The coaching points for the mirrored plays 926 On, 926 Guard Trap, and 926 Gut 
are the same, with the exception that the fullback drives off his right foot and 
lead steps with his left on the 26 plays. Versus the even front, the fullback aims 
for the left foot of the center. The fullback reads the alignment and gap charge 
of the man on the 6 guard (left guard). If the defender is a “B” gap control 
player, the fullback hits the seam between the guard and the center. If the 
defender is in the seam, the fullback may cut to his right over the landmark he 
used for the odd defense. The mirrored plays are 926 On, 926 Guard Trap, and 
926 Gut.

123 Guard Trap—Versus the odd defense, the fullback coaching points are the 
same as 124 Guard Trap. Versus the even defense, the fullback aims for the left 
foot of the 4 guard (right guard). The fullback takes the handoff and hugs the 
outside hip of the 3 tackle. The 3 tackle blocks inside and seals the linebacker 
for the fullback on 123 Guard Trap. Regardless of whether the defense is odd or 
even, the fullback must keep his eyes up and brush behind the outside hip of the 
tackle as the tackle seals the linebacker. The mirrored play of 123 Guard Trap is 
927 Guard Trap.

983 Cross Block—On 983 Cross Block, the fullback 
jab steps with his right foot 
with his toe on a parallel plane to the line of scrimmage. The aiming point for 
the third step is the inside foot of the right tackle. He takes the handoff on the 
third step and reads the defensive tackle’s gap responsibility. If the defensive 
tackle anchors the inside seam, the fullback breaks outside the defensive 
tackle. If the defensive tackle anchors the outside seam, the fullback breaks 
inside the defensive tackle. 
Against an outside seam defensive tackle on the odd defense, the fullback may 
cut back in reference to the action of the nose man. The fullback may cut the 
983 Cross Block to the backside of the nose man. The mirrored play is 187 Cross 
Block.

991 Option—The fullback pushes off his right foot and crosses over to gain 
pitch relationship to the right. The fullback maintains the proper pitch 
relationship with the quarterback. You should refer to the left halfback 
coaching points for 182 Down Option for details of the proper pitch 
relationship. The mirrored play of 991 Option is 199 Option. 
Diagram 7-25: 991 Option.

182 Down Gut—The fullback pushes off his left foot and lead steps with his 
right foot. His aiming point is the outside foot of the tackle. The fullback takes 
the handoff on his third step (a right-foot step) and adjusts to the block of the 
tight end. The fullback brushes the hip of the tight end as he adjusts. The 
fullback’s shoulder should square as he hits the aiming point, allowing him to cut 
in either direction. The mirrored play is 987 Down Gut. 

Delaware Wing-T Linemen 
The Delaware Wing-T scheme develops conflicts which take advantage of the 
standard defensive reaction to blocking patterns. As discussed earlier, a defensive 
conflict is created when the defender reacts properly to a block. By reacting 
properly to the block, the defender makes himself vulnerable to a companion block 
or companion play. For example, if the man on the defensive tackle closes with the 
offensive tackle’s down block to stop 124 Guard Trap, the defensive tackle is 
vulnerable to 121 Down. 
For the full advantage of the conflicts to be realized, individual blocking techniques 
must be mastered, and a variety of blocking schemes must be learned. The 
sophistication of the Wing-T blocking schemes makes playing offensive line in the 
Wing-T a challenging and enjoyable experience. Once they understand the Wing-T 
scheme, linemen have fun in their assignments as they realize that every move they 
make will place the defender at the point of attack in a precarious position. Creating 
conflicts can be an enjoyable experience for the Wing-T offensive linemen. 
In the Delaware Wing-T system, there are three line positions; center, guard, and 
tackle. If the team’s staffing permits, the offensive line may be coached by two 
coaches. One coach takes the center and guards, while the other coach takes the 
tackles and ends. Both coaches should work together during group periods. 
THE WING-T CENTER 
The center's stance is a balanced stance. His heels are slightly raised, and his neck 
is bowed. His hips are slightly higher than the flat of his back. His feet are evenly 
spaced with no stagger. The center must roll his heels outward. Many young 
centers will widen their feet to snap the ball. 
His feet must be wider than shoulder width, but only slightly wider. An exaggerated 
width of the stance is a detriment to blocking. The stance is opened by the heels 
rolling outward. This step also creates the power line. The power line is described in 
the section which describes the guard's stance. 

A four-point center stance is a preferred stance for balance. It should be noted, 
however, that the four-point stance may lower the shoulders somewhat. The four- 
point stance also benefits the check blocking of the center, giving him a push hand 
or point hand as he fills for a backside pulling guard. 
A push hand allows the center to push off as he snaps the ball. This factor adds 
more initial force on the center's movement. A point hand is the hand the center 
uses to point or open to the defender positioned near the off hand. As the center 
snaps the ball, his point hand snaps out to the target, thereby providing a rubber 
band effect on the body of the center. The point hand snaps the center to the 
target. 
The three-point stance does not give the center these advantages. The three-point 
stance places the center's hand behind his shoulders. In the three-point center 
stance, the center normally rests the forearm across his knee. This action will cost 
the center momentum since he loses a push-and-point hand. 
As aresult, the nose man will get an advantage against a three-point stance center. 
The nose man will get his hands on the center first, because of the lag of the off 
hand when it is placed across the thigh pad. When placed across the thigh pad, the 
elbow must first snap outward to force the hand forward. Then, the elbow must 
rotate inward as the hand is used to gain inside leverage on the nose man. When 
brought from the ground in the four-point stance, the off hand simply snaps upward. 
The initial movement of having to snap the elbow outward to move the hand off the 
thigh is not needed in the four-point stance. Less movement means less delay. The 
time factor in this situation involves fractions of seconds. However, any advantage 
is significant. This time factor is referred to as the time to domination. 
For coaches who like a large-bodied center, a three-point stance is preferred. A 
large center will usually get top heavy in a four-point stance. The larger-bodied 
center tends to have more power in the hips. Thus, he may get away with a slightly 
slower time to domination. Once contact is secured, however, the larger center may 
dominate using his great bulk and power to quickly turn the scales in his favor. 
The center places the ball under his corresponding eye. A right-handed center 
places the ball under his right eye, while a left-handed center places the ball under 
his left eye. The ball should be placed as close to the vertical dissecting plane as 
possible. Placing the ball under the eye allows the center to snap the ball ina 
Straight line. 
The fingers of the center's off hand should be spread. He should be on his fingertips 
with his fingers slightly flexed. The center grasps the ball using a quarterback’s 
grasp. However, his fingers are not on the laces. The center places his thumb on the 
laces, with his hand over the forward '/3 of the ball.

The center's hand does not cover the point, but it does wrap around the forward '/3. 
His wrist is rolled outward. Rolling the wrist outward forces the ball to tilt slightly 
with the nose up. The wrist is locked in this position throughout the snapping 
motion. Keeping the wrist locked causes a natural rotation of the ball on the 
snapping motion. The quarterback will receive the ball slightly turned. The nose of 
the ball will turn left with the right-handed center. This turning allows the right- 
handed center to snap the ball to the right-handed quarterback with one great 
advantage. The center will present the ball in such a manner that the quarterback 
will receive the ball with the laces hitting the fingertips of the quarterback’s top 
hand. 
There are other methods of the center-quarterback exchange which also give the 
quarterback the laces. All are sound and effective methods. The old Wing-T style, 
for example, is to have the center use both hands on the ball. The ball is placed on 
its point with the nose down. The center places the thumbs beside the laces. The 
thumbs point downward, and the ball is snapped backward in a flipping motion. The 
nose of the ball is turned under on the snap so that it points to the quarterback as 
the snap is received. The quarterback hands are placed in a heel-to-heel relationship 
with his thumbs side by side. The ball is delivered, and the quarterback slides his 
dominant hand slightly under to get the fingers on the laces. 
This old Wing-T method is still used in many programs. While some coaches prefer 
to have acenter snap the ball with two hands, the method is losing its appeal, 
primarily due to the emphasis on using the hands when blocking. Using two hands to 
snap the ball momentarily places the center in an undesirable position. Also, the 
presnap ball position with the ball on the forward point allows the defensive 
linemen, and particularly the nose, to crowd the ball—a disadvantage to the Wing-T 
linemen. 
The modern method of snapping the ball is an upward and backward snap. If a coach 
were to kneel on the off-hand side of the center and place the underside of his 
forearm across the hips of the center so that the coach's hand extended out from 
the hip of the center, the center's snapping elbow would hit the coach's hand on the 
snap. The snap is upward. The snapping elbow passes outside the plane of the 
center's body and brushes his outside hip. The wrist Is hyper-flexed and locked. The 
ball reaches a point just posterior of his crotch as it pops into the quarterback’s top 
hand. 
A good snap makes a popping noise as the ball hits the quarterback’s top hand. The 
snapping motion involves a movement which enables the center to place his off 
hand in contact with a nose man at the exact moment the quarterback secures the 
ball. The directional foot (i.e., the foot the center moves to execute the block) 
moves at the same moment the ball moves. A good center Is an excellent blocker 
who incidentally snaps the ball to the center. The snapping motion does not 
interfere with the blocking technique of a good center. 

The center uses two blocking techniques—the hands technique and the shoulder 
block technique. Against a nose, the center snaps the ball up and back. At the same 
time, the off hand snaps forward to gain domination on the nose. The shoulder 
technique is used when the center angle blocks, for example, as ina check block. 
The center also uses his shoulders for leverage when blocking linebackers and 
executing reach blocks on the near down lineman. The shoulder block technique Is 
discussed earlier in this text in the section on running backs. 
THE WING-T GUARD 
The Wing-T guard uses a three-point stance with his weight balanced in his hips. 
The fingertips of his hand lightly touch the ground. His heels are only slightly raised 
as his weight is centered on the balls of his feet. His toes are pointed straight 
ahead. The coach stresses the point that the toes must never point outward. The 
ideal stance will have the toes slightly rolled inward as the heels roll outward. This 
creates a power line in the legs. The rolling action is commonly called the “Z in the 
knee.” His back is flat and his neck is bowed, thereby keeping the eyes up. 
His weight is mentally focused in a push foot. It is common terminology for coaches 
at all levels to describe the initial movement of a blocker as a step. Stepping is not 
what the coach wants. The blocker must push off a push foot. The lead foot then is 
snapped to the ground in a recovery. If the blocker pushes off in a violent manner, 
the lead foot stride will automatically shorten and drive downward to keep the 
blocker from falling. The lead step is actually a catch step. The center of gravity is 
forward of the lead step as the guard's hands lead his body. The head is snapped 
backward as the hands are thrown forward. The hips naturally sink and snap 
forward with the hands. The push foot then is snapped off the turf as the body is 
propelled forward by the push and the throwing of the hands. 
Why the push? A step is a heel strike. A coach can prove this fact by video taping 
athletes as they walk. Offensive line coaches tend to universally agree that a 
lineman should not be on his heels. Therefore, a blocker does not step. He pushes 
and catches. Offensive line coaches also generally agree that the power blocking 
steps must be short. To this end, the steps are called power steps in order to 
differentiate between the normal stride distance to the preferred blocking stride of 
four inches. The push off the push foot drives the body forward with force. The lead 
step must immediately hit the ground to recover the body from the forward pitch of 
the center of gravity. Thus, the foot hits the ground no more than four inches from 
the starting point. The push foot theory of coaching is even more important to angle 
blocking and blocking with a shoulder. The push foot method of blocking provides 
more force. Force is the determining factor of blocking and is the key to creating 
movement.

In summary, a base blocking lineman pushes off a push foot. As the push foot drives 
the lineman’s center of gravity forward, his hands are thrown forward. The lead 
step shortens and balances the blocker as his back foot follows. His head is 
snapped backward, and his hips are snapped forward as his hands are thrown. 
Contact is made as the feet maintain a powerful turnover. The coach must not 
allow the blocker to roll his heels inward on contact. This action opens the hips and 
breaks the Z in the knee. The successful blocker runs through the defender, not to 
the defender. The guard is the principal pull blocker in the Wing-T. No Wing-T 
offense exists without pulling guards. 
There are two kinds of pull blocks (pulls): the trap pull and the sweep pull. The two 
pulls are different in all aspects of mechanics. The most prominent difference, and a 
good starting point in teaching young linemen to differentiate between the two, is 
the contact shoulder. Ona 
trap pull, the contact shoulder is the shoulder which 
corresponds to the direction of the pull. If a guard is trap pulling right, the contact 
shoulder on a trap pull is the right shoulder. A trapping guard pulling to the left 
contacts the defender with his left shoulder. Trap pulling buzz phrases for coaching 
include “pull left—hit left” and “pull right—hit right.” This coaching point helps the 
trapper understand how to achieve the inside-out angle desired on a trap pull. By 
using the corresponding shoulder, the head of the blocker is place on the upfield 
shoulder of the defender—giving the blocker the inside-out leverage needed for a 
successful trap pull. 
The trap pulling guard pushes off his offside foot. His near hand snaps outward to a 
simulated handshake offer. This action opens the near hip, but prevents the guard 
from stepping in the bucket. 
The lead step is never behind the plane of the heels of the blocker's stance. Ona 
short trap, the lead step actually gains ground. On a long trap, the lead step is on 
the same horizontal plane as his heels. The flatter lead steps allows the lineman to 
clear his inside teammate. Long traps are always across the ball. Short traps are 
traps out from the ball or traps across the ball to the “A” gap seam. The sweep pull 
is a deeper pull which also may be a short or long pull. Short sweep pulls are called 
“log blocks,” when the pulling guard uses his inside shoulder to seal the defensive 
end inside. A sweep pull which kicks out the force is another type of short sweep 
pull. The short sweep pull and kick out block is also called a “hammer pull.” The 
hammer pull was developed for single wing football and is still an effective method 
of creating the alley crease on the buck sweep series.

Bucket step 
Diagram 8-1: Hammer block for buck sweep. 
The initial movements for both the log and hammer sweep pulls are identical. Only 
the finishing movements are different. The short sweep pulling guard begins with a 
hard push off his inside foot, as he simultaneously rotates his toes inward. Rotating 
the toes of the push foot inward allows the hips to open to 90 degrees or more. 
When pulling right, the left foot is the push foot. The right foot is jerked backward, 
as the right elbow is jerked backward and to the left. Young linemen can be trained 
to open deeply by having them attempt to slap their left buttock with their right 
hand. This movement snaps the shoulder around and forces the hip to open. The 
right foot is also forced to bucket step, a key coaching point to sweep pulling. The 
bucket step forces the guard to pivot approximately 110 degrees so that he is 
heading backward to some degree. 
The second step crosses over to a point where the heel is directly in front of the 
toes of the bucket foot. The inside shoulder dips, and the guard gets his eyes to the 
target area as the bucket foot makes the third step and regains a normal base. On 
the fourth step, made with the inside foot, the guard gets his shoulders back to 
parallel with the line of scrimmage. The fifth step is made straight ahead as the 
guard analyzes the relative positioning of the force. If the force is coming hard, the 
guard plants the inside foot at a 45-degree step, keeping the toe forward. The 45- 
degree plant step is called the hammer step. 
The seventh step is made with the outside foot off of the 45-degree hammer step. 
The outside foot is a 90-degree step to a point where the guard may meet the 
upfield shoulder of the force defender. The inside foot then follows, and the guard 
moves along a plane which is parallel to the line of scrimmage. He moves outward 
and widens his base to contact the force with what had been his outside shoulder. 
A hammer block on the right side is made with the right shoulder. The head of the 
guard is ideally slightly behind the force defender. This head positioning makes the 
defender run around the hammer block to make the play. By the time he runs around 
the block, the ball carrier has hit the crease of the alley.

The long sweep pull starts out like along trap. The initial step is a flat step off of 
the outside foot push. The shoulders face a plane parallel to the line of scrimmage 
as the guard passes between the quarterback and center. The split of the guard 
should be wide enough to allow him to clear the center as he makes his third step. A 
tight split alters this three-step prescription, as well as presents a potential threat 
for causing a fumble. Guards with too tight a split may hit the ball on the handshake 
opening of the long-trap technique. They sometimes cause a fumble as they hit the 
ball before the quarterback can properly seat the ball. Once the guard clears the 
center on his third step, he crosses over and gains depth. The crossover Is 
sometimes called the “Heisman pull” because the movement resembles the Heisman 
trophy pose. Depth is gained to approximately 3 and 1/2 yards. The short pull sweep 
guard or hammer guard is usually a little deeper. The backside guard will then 
attack the outside hip of the blocker assigned to seal the edge of the defense. On 
121, the 6 guard pulls and attacks the outside hip of the wingback. The backside 
guard keeps his eyes inside as he looks for leakage inside. He uses his inside shoulder 
pad to drive through any defender’s outside shoulder. With proper technique, the 
backside guard may seal one, two, or even three defenders as he continues on the 
proper path.

THE WING-T TACKLE 
The Wing-T tackle must be particularly skilled at two things—blocking down and 
post blocking. His stance is a three-point stance. He may have a slightly more 
forward pitch to his stance. The forward pitch is allowable since the tackle does not 
pull as extensively as the guard. However, the Wing-T tackle does cutoff block on 
the backside and fire block or reach the playside gap. Although slight pressure may 
be applied to his down hand, he must also be able to move in either direction. The 
coaching points of the tackle’s base blocking technique are identical to the guards.

The tackle must be keenly aware of his push foot because he is the lead blocker on 
the double team of the even-defense tackle. The tackle position skills are closely 
related to the center skills. Many high schools find their best center prospect or 
center backup is a tackle or a former tackle. 
THE 12 WING-T LINE BLOCKING TECHNIQUES 
1, 
Area Block—An area block secures the area over the offensive lineman. Versus a 
down lineman, the technique is a technique of power. Factors to be evaluated 
are the lineman’s time to domination, lift, and movement. As earlier discussed in 
the text description of the offensive guard coaching points, the area block 
involves a push foot, the hands, the hips, and the feet. The blockers weight is 
mentally focused in a push foot. The blocker must push off a push foot. The lead 
foot is then snapped to the ground in a recovery. If the blocker pushes off ina 
violent manner, his lead foot stride will automatically shorten and drive 
downward to keep him from falling. The lead step is actually a catch step. The 
center of gravity is forward of the lead step as the hands lead the body. The 
head is snapped backward as the hands are thrown forward. The hips naturally 
sink and snap forward with the hands. The push foot then is snapped off the 
turf as the body is propelled forward by the push and the throwing of the hands. 
The block is finished by the thrust of the two-fisted punch and the lift of the 
defender as the blocker's feet continue to churn.

2. Bump Lead—The bump lead is a combination block which is a variation of the 
double team block. On a bump lead combination, the post blocker is the inside 
blocker. The post blocker executes the coaching points of an area block. The 
blocking landmark is the chin of the defender. The post blocker gains domination 
and lift of the defender, as the outside blocker (lead blocker) completes the lift 
and assists in the movement. On a bump lead, the post blocker knows the lead 
blocker’s primary responsibility is the second level. A post blocker must work to 
gain outside leverage on a bump-lead combination block. Ideally, the post 
blocker gains outside leverage as the lead blocker bumps the defender and 
comes off the block. The lead blocker seals the linebacker with an inside 
shoulder block to the outside hip of the linebacker.

3. Check Block—Used primarily by the center, the check block is an angle block 
which fills the gap created by the pulling lineman. The center pushes off his 
opposite foot and uses the handshake technique with his near hand. The near 
hand opens the shoulders to the landmark, as the back foot pushes off. The 
near foot steps to 
anear 45-degree angle. The tighter the defensive lineman is 
to the line of scrimmage, the flatter the step of the near foot. Guards may 
check block when the tackle gut blocks inside. For more coaching points on the 
check block, you should refer to the discussion of the down block. The check 
block is a center down block. 
Pushes off opposite foot 
Diagram 8-5: Center check block. 
4. Cutoff Block—The cutoff block cuts off an inside defender from pursuit. The 
cutoff blocker is a backside blocker. The lineman pushes off laterally on his 
outside foot. The inside foot takes a short jab at a 45-degree angle upfield. The 
main coaching point of the cutoff block is the placement of the blocker’s head. 
The blocker must place his inside earhole of his headgear to the hip of his inside 
teammate. This point helps the blocker get around on a down defender to the 
inside. It also helps the lineman keep his head and shoulders forward. The cutoff 
blocker attempts to get his outside shoulder around to block the inside portion 
of the defender who is aligned in the nearest inside seam. The technique 
involves a “dip and rip” through the defender’s armpit. The blocker dips his 
outside shoulder and rips his outside arm up in an uppercut movement. This 
action allows the blocker to clear the defender on him and leverage the inside 
seam. Once the inside seam Is secured with inside-out positioning, the blocker 
continues to a depth of three yards and then flattens his path as he angles to 
the attack side. He sprints to the running alley and looks for the free safety or 
the cornerback. The correct downfield finish of the cutoff block will have the 
blocker traveling near parallel to the line of scrimmage as he attempts to 
blindside a would-be tackler from the secondary. The ball carrier looks for the 
downfield blindside and cuts behind the alley blocker as he breaks against the

grain. The cutoff block is also a fill block for a pulling guard or tackle. If the fill 
is made by a lineman originally aligned to the outside of the pulling guard, the 
fill technique is a cutoff block.

Diagram 8-7: Alley block. 
5. Down Block—The down block is an angle block toward the ball. The down block 
is used to block a defender aligned in the near inside seam of an offensive 
lineman. The outside foot pushes, and the inside foot angles to the defender. 
The coaching points of the down block are the same as for the check block. The 
aiming point depends on the alignment depth of the defender. The common 
landmark is the chin of the defender, more specifically the near pulse point of 
the carotid artery in the neck. This aiming point allows leeway for blocking both 
a penetrating defender and the gorilla technique defender. The head of the 
down blocker slides to the front of the penetrating defender. Against the gorilla 

defender who wants to cross hat, the head of the blocker stays on line to the 
pulse point of the defender. The outside hand drives under the armpit of the 
defender. This action lifts his near pad and allows the blocker to lift the 
defender and gain leverage. The outside hand locks the armpit between the 
thumb and index finger. Except for his thumb, his fingers are curled to form a 
punch. The outside arm drives the defender’s shoulder upward as the hips roll 
and the defender is pinned. If the defender attempts to give ground to cross hat, 
the blocker may reverse body block to seal the defender off from pursuit. A 
reverse body block on a down block to the left is accomplished by the offensive 
lineman swinging his right hip into the left hip of the defender. 
BALL

Diagram 8-8: Down block. 
6. Fire Block—The fire block is a playside zone block. The technique is identical to 
the backside cutoff block. The fire blocking lineman attempts to get over and 
up and sweep anything in his path. When fire blocking on a lineman on him, the 
offensive lineman pushes and steps as he does on a backside cutoff. The inside 
arm is ripped up through the outside armpit of the defensive lineman. If the 
defensive lineman attempts to skate outward, the fire blocker locks on him and 
works to gain outside leverage. The fire blocking lineman must get his inside pad 
on the outside pad of the defender and, if possible, continue to the next level. If 
the defender penetrates inside on the snap, the blocker rubs him inside to the 
inside fire blocker. The outside fire blocker uses his inside pad and arm to knock 
the penetrator inside, turning the defender's shoulders to create a blocking 
surface for the inside blocker. The inside fire blocker has coaching points 
identical to the backside cutoff blocker. If the defender aligned on the outside 
teammate skates, the inside blocker goes up to the next level. If the defender 
penetrates, the blocker gets around on him as he gets his inside pad on the 
outside shoulder and hip of the penetrating defender. An inside fire blocker may 
read the action of the near defensive lineman to the outside by focusing on the 
inside knee of the defender. If the knee moves away from the blocker, the

blocker recognizes the defender to be stunting outside. When the defender 
stunts outside against an inside fire blocker, the fire blocker goes up to the next 
level to get the linebacker. If the knee moves toward the inside fire blocker, the 
fire blocker attacks the opposite knee with his inside shoulder. This movement 
allows the blocker to get around on the defender and seal him inside. The inside 
fire blocker is assisted by the turn of the defender’s shoulders by the outside 
blocker's uppercut of the defender’s inside armpit. 
Diagram 8-9: Fire block. 
7. 
Gut Block—The gut block is a step-around block. The outside gut blocking 
lineman steps around a down block of a teammate. An outside gut block is 
called a J-Gut. The inside gut blocking lineman steps around a check blocking 
lineman. The gut blocking lineman pushes off the opposite foot and takes a 
slight bucket step with the lead foot. The lead foot bucket step is more of a 
sideways step with the toes pointing upfield. A slight angle of the foot is 
permissible. The offside shoulder dips and brushes the hips as the lead hand 
reaches. The gut blocker keeps his shoulders square as he clears the check 
blocker. The point of attack determines the desired leverage technique on the 
linebacker. The pursuit of the linebacker is also a factor in the finish of the gut 
block. The block may finish face up, with outside shoulder leverage, or with 
inside shoulder leverage.

8. Double Team—The double team is closely related to the bump lead block. The 
double team is a sell out 2-on-1 block where the bump lead is a reading 
combination block. The coaching points for the double-team post blocker are 
the same as the combination post blocker. Unlike the combination post blocker, 
the double-team post blocker does not have to be concerned with taking over 
the defender in a single area block. The double-team post blocker is concerned 
with inside leakage of the defender. The lead blocker is responsible for outside 
leakage. Both the post and lead blocker share responsibility in getting their hips 
together. The lead blocker is primarily responsible for swinging his inside hip to 
the outside hip of the post blocker. There should be no daylight between the 
hips. The post blocker must make sure his hips do not swing inside on contact. 
The post blocker must stay vertical and drive the defender straight back. 
Both blockers are responsible for not allowing the defender to dive to the 
ground upon recognition of the double team. They should not hit down at the 
defender. Each blocker should attempt to meat hook the defender under the 
pads if he attempts to drop. The lead blocker uses only his inside arm to hook 
the outside pad of the defender. On lead block technique, the outside blocker 
always keeps his shoulders square and his outside arm free. The goal of the 
double team against a diving defender is to hook him and flip him on his back. 
The defender desires to split a double team and roll outside. The hook technique 
with the arms forces the defender on his back to the inside. No diving defender 
can split a double team if the double team blockers use their hands and arms to 
lift the defender and maintain underneath leverage. Both arms of the post 
blocker and the inside arm of the lead blocker act together on the torso of the 
defender to lift and twist him inside. The feet of the double team blockers must 
never stop. Churning the feet even against a buried defender allows the double 
team to dig him out and lift and twist him.

The psychological effect of the effective double team is devastating ona 
defensive lineman. As such, there are times in which the Wing-T coach should 
use a play calling for a double team of a good defensive lineman in order to send 
a psychological message. Games have been won with the dominating double 
team at the point of attack. No other block in the Wing-T scheme has such 
potential for impact. 
A double team against an inside stunting lineman turns into a bump lead. The 
lead blocker must never waste himself on a stunting defender. In order to read 
the stunt, the lead blocker must take the proper steps. The lead blocker must 
push off the outside foot and glide inside with his shoulders square. The glide 
step is an angular step but the toes remain pointed straight ahead. Keeping the 
toes straight ahead as the foot glides over and up allows the shoulders of the 
lead blocker to remain parallel. The inside arm hooks the outside armpit of the 
defender and lifts the outside pad in a twisting manner to the inside. This action 
creates more blocking surface for the post blocker and helps to flip the 
defender.

Trap Pull—Because of his distance from the center of the formation, the tackle 
usually long traps. The tackle trap is a trademark Wing-T play. The eight-man 
front is a formidable alignment against the guard trap scheme. However, the 
tackle trap is designed to attack the eight-man front and is naturally an 
important trap to carry in your Wing-T package. The tackle opens to the trap 
side with a push off of the outside foot and a handshake pull of the near 
shoulder. The near shoulder opens the hips to the plane of the tackle’s heels 
while the toes of the lead foot points down a line running parallel to the line of 
scrimmage. 
The tackle drives down the original heel line of the offensive guard to a point 
near the “A” gap. Once the tackle reaches the near “A” gap, he begins to look 
inside, targeting the buttocks of the onside guard as he passes the center. The 
tackle wants to brush his upfield shoulder against the buttocks of the onside 
guard. This landmark gets the tackle up into the line of scrimmage and puts him 

on line to attack the defender with his trapping shoulder. He follows the 
standard trap pull rule of pull right—hit right and pull left—hit left. Pulling to his 
left, the tackle will hit the defender with his left shoulder. This coaching point 
keeps the tackle on an inside-out angle. Slower tackles may close their guard 
split to a foot-to-foot split, allowing them a quicker time to target. The guard 
may tighten his alignment to the ball as the tackle deepens his alignment. This 
two-fold adjustment of depth will give the tackle a better line and easier 
clearance of the near guard.

10. Sweep Pull—The tackle may either long sweep pull and wall or the tackle may 
short sweep pull and hammer block. The specifics of the backside wall and 
hammer were thoroughly discussed in the guard section. The backside wall pull 
demands the tackle push off his outside foot and bucket his lead foot to 90 
degrees. The heel strikes slightly past 90 degrees but the toe points to an angle 
less than 90 degrees from the line of scrimmage. The bucket step does not pull 
the lead shoulder backward past 90 degrees. The hip opens, but the push foot 
toes only pivot slightly to the path. This type of movement will give the tackle

a downhill angle into the line of scrimmage as he pulls. The landmark ona 
tackle backside sweep pull for walling is the hip of the corresponding guard. The 
guard will usually lead the tackle when the tackle wall pulls. The tackle should 
pull slightly deeper than the guard to trail on a path parallel to that of the 
guard. 
lf the guard pulls into the line of scrimmage, the tackle continues on the 
straight line looking outside for a strong safety wheeling into the hole. If the 
guard turns outward, then the tackle curls inward and looks inside to wall off 
the inside pursuit. The walling tackle attempts to drive his inside arm and pad 
through any leakage. If he is to continue through the outside shoulder of a 
defender leaking from inside, he simply drives his inside pad through the outside 
shoulder of the defender and continues on his path. An important coaching point 
for the backside wall pull of the tackle is to stay approximately 3 and '/2 feet 
behind the guard.

Diagram 8-13: Hammer pull. 
The hammer pull is identical to the guard hammer pull. The inside foot pushes 
and pivots as the outside foot buckets past 90 degrees. The near shoulder is 
pulled backward as the hand is swung behind the buttocks to the opposite hip. 
The tackle proceeds on a line nearly 180 degrees from his original alignment. 
The second step is a cross over of the push foot and lands heel to toe with the 
137 

lead foot. The third step gains a base and widens the path as the rainbow is 
made. The fourth step is a vertical step as the tackle regains a forward position 
with his shoulders parallel to the line of scrimmage. The tackle continues 
upfield looking for the force outside. Once the proper positioning is gained on 
the force, the tackle plant steps and drives outward at a 90-degree angle, 
completing the hammer block. 
Log Block—Tackle log blocks are executed as a sweep pull and may be made off 
of the hammer steps or the backside wall pull. The backside wall pull as a log 
block is described in the backside sweep pull. The log pull off of the short 
sweep pull and hammer steps are identical up to the fifth step with the lead 
foot. Once the fifth step is made, the tackle looks to brush the hip of the edge 
blocker, either the wing or the tight end. The tackle brushes the hip of the 
sealing edge blocker with his inside pad as he looks inside. The tackle continues 
ona 
vertical path as long as he can drive his inside shoulder through a leaking 
defender. If no linebacker appears, the tackle continues on his vertical path and 
seeks out the free safety or the pursuit of the number 6 defender.

12. Reach Block—The reach block is a fire block. The difference is the '/2 gap reach. 
The fire block is a full gap reach while the reach block is a'/2 gap reach. A 
defender declaring his gap responsibility with a shaded alignment will be 
blocked by the inside blocker. A head-up defender will be fire blocked with a 
tighter landmark. The landmark for a reach block on a headup defender Is the 
outside V, just playside of the chin. Once the landmark is secured, the reach 
blocker works to maximize his outside leverage with upfield movement. 
Movement is a critical factor in the reach block. The ideal reach block, since it is 
a tighter block than the fire block, achieves vertical movement with outside 
leverage.

The Delaware Wing-T End 
The Delaware Wing-T offense is a flank offense. This characteristic means success 
is dependent upon the execution at the edge of the offense. The end position is a 
key position in attacking a defensive flank. Two distinct end positions exist—the 
tight end and the spread end (split end). The best alignment philosophy when using 
a tight and a spread end is to have the ends specialize in the duties of either tight 
end or spread end. A result of specialization is the flipping of sides according to 
formation. Ends which specialize will flip sides according to the formation. 
The Wing-T coach may simply use a right end and a left end without specialization 
of duties. However, in an instance where the ends are not specialized, both ends 
must possess the speed needed for wide receiver and the strength needed for 
blocking down on a defensive tackle. As most coaches realize, this is a tough 
combination to find at any level of competition. In the Delaware Wing-T offense, 
the duties are individualized. To avoid substituting for a two-tight end formation, the 
Wing-T coach will have to teach the spread end the tight-end techniques. 
TIGHT END STANCE 
The tight end uses the standard offensive lineman three-point stance. You should 
refer to the stance of the offensive guard for more details on the three-point 
stance. The tight end stance differs from the guard stance in that the tight end 
stance is a slightly staggered stance. The guard stance is a balanced stance with 
the feet even. The preferred tight end stance is an inside foot back stagger of toe to 
heel. The inside hand is preferred to be down because most of his blocks are inside 
blocks. In addition, in the Wing-T offense, most of the tight end releases are inside. 
The spread end stance is a two-point stance with a toe-to-heel stagger of the 
inside foot. The feet are set close together in order to facilitate the sprinter's start. 
The two-point stance allows the spread end to use his hands to escape a pressing 
cornerback. The upright stance also allows the spread end to read the action of the 
secondary and to read the coverage disguises.

BLOCKING TECHNIQUES OF THE WING-T ENDS 
The tight end must master the offensive line blocking techniques. The tight end 
even has to master the sweep pull across the ball. Other offensive line blocking 
techniques which the tight end must master are the area block, the reach block, the 
fire block, the down block, the lead black in the double team and bump lead 
combinations, and the post block in the double team and bump lead combinations 
with the wingback. The spread end must learn techniques related to blocking from 
the alignment width of a spread end. If no personnel switch is made for the two- 
tight end formation, the spread end must also master the tight end blocks. From the 
spread alignment, the spread end must master the crackback block and the stalk 
block. 
The crackback block is used to collapse the flank. The crackback block is a block 
that allows the spread end to pin the force inside. The spread end releases inside on 
a vertical path for two steps as he reads the action of the invert safety. After the 
second step, the spread end drives inside on a flat path. If the force is coming froma 
deep position, the force will be struck face to face by the spread end. If the force Is 
attacking the line of scrimmage on a vertical path, the spread ends leads him like a 
duck hunter leads the duck in flight. The spread end places his head across the path 
of the force defender and drives his outside shoulder through the shoulder of the 
defender. Crackback blocks are illegal when thrown below the waist. 
lf the defender picks up the crack back path and turns his back to the spread end, 
the spread end has two options. The spread end may stop one yard from the force 
and shadow him like a basketball player playing defense. The ball carrier then 
rounds the edge, making the force turn outside. Once the force turns outside, the 
spread end may legally contact him face to face in a stalk technique and wall him 
inside as the ball carrier rounds the flank.

The second option is to continue to the next level defender. If the force turns his 
back early enough, the lead blocker may read his action and see that the spread end 
will not be able to legally finish the crack back. The lead blocker then switches his 
responsibility to block the force, as the spread end continues to the next level, 
usually the free safety. The lead blocker may actually kick out the hard force as the 
spread end seals the free safety inside. This action creates a tight alley for the ball 
carrier and leaves the unblocked cornerback out on an outside island. The 
cornerback cannot risk sticking his nose inside the force. The disciplined cornerback 
will not be a factor on the adjusted crack angle with a force kick-out by the lead 
blocker. 
The stalk block is the second major blocking technique which the spread end must 
learn. The stalk block is used against a deep coverage defensive back. The stalk 
block is normally used against a deep '/3 cornerback or a man-to-man cornerback. To 
stalk block, the spread end releases vertically at full speed. Once the spread end 
breaks the cushion or sees the defensive back gather his feet to break forward, the 
spread end sinks his hips and comes under control. The spread end chops his feet 
and flexes his elbows as he squares up to the defender. He punches the heels of his 
hands to the numbers of the defender’s jersey and skates with him as he stays 
square to the defender. If the defender beats the stalk blocker to either side, the 
stalk blocker uses the chop and roll as the last resort. The chop technique is a 
cross-body block technique in which the spread end drives the elbow opposite the 
side of the defender’s escape across the far thigh of the defender. The opposite hip 
then is snapped into the near hip of the defender, as the blocker locks in the 
defender with the hinging effect of the elbow and hip. The snapping effect of the 
hips knocks the defender off his feet. Another advantage of this technique Is the 
positioning of the blocker’s head. On a properly executed body block, the blocker's 
head will remain in front of the defender. If the defender attempts to escape the 
stalker by avoiding contact, the stalker may throw across body block at the 
defender and roll three times at his feet. This action will force the defender’s hands 
down and knock him off balance.

TIGHT END RELEASES 
The tight end uses three basic releases: arc release, block release, and inside 
release. 
e 
Arc Release—The tight end executes a sweep pull technique to the outside. The 
bucket creates distance from the line of scrimmage. The cushion created by the 
bucket step prevents the defensive end from getting his hands on the tight end. 
The depth also allows the arc-releasing tight end to read the action of the 
secondary force. Once the depth is gained, the tight end squares his shoulders 
and looks upfield.

Block Release—The block release may be used by either the tight end or the 
spread end. The block-releasing tight end slams his shoulder into the defender. 
He keeps his head to the side of the desired release. For an outside block 
release, the end slams the defender with his inside shoulder. Once the blow is 
delivered, the end quickly disengages and releases into the pattern. A key 
coaching point of the block release is the end’s leverage on the defender. The 
end must strike the blow from the hips and hit upward through the defender. 
Ball moving to the offensive right 
Diagram 9-4: Block release. 
Inside Release—The inside release may be executed by the tight end or the 
spread end. Two techniques are available to the inside releasing end: the dip- 
and-rip release and the swim release. On the dip-and-rip release, the end dips 
the outside shoulder as he pushes off his outside foot and glide steps inside at a 
45-degree angle upfield. The outside shoulder is ripped up through the inside 
armpit and shoulder of the defender. The inside shoulder works forward as the 
shoulders square on the release. The outside arm is used in the manner of an 
uppercut punch to break the grasp of the defender and lift the defender's inside 
shoulder. The end wants to create a tilt of the defender’s shoulders. The 
upward tilt of the defender’s inside shoulder opens a pathway for the end. 
The second type of inside release is the swim release. The initial step Is a 49- 
degree inside step with the inside foot and a hard push with the outside foot. 
Instead of dipping to rip underneath the defender, the outside arm Is punched 
over the top of the defender’s inside shoulder. The inside hand may be used to 
grab and jerk the inside shoulder downward. The downward jerk of the 
defender’s inside shoulder aids in the clearance of the outside punch. The 

a a OL Cae 
ae De a Oe ne 
ee a 
a 
ee 
ite 
he 
outside foot follows with the punch and is placed in a heel to heel relationship 
directly behind the defender's inside foot. The heel to heel relationship of the 
outside foot step is the most important coaching point of the swim release. 
Once the heel to heel position is obtained, the end has effectively cleared the 
defender. The positioning of the foot also guarantees the vertical recovery of 
the inside release. An end who releases inside cannot allow his path to be 
flattened by the defender. The techniques of the inside release may also be 
used by both ends for a quick vertical outside release. 

Attacking the Slide 4-3 
The fast-growing popularity of the slide 4-3 defensive scheme causes special 
attention to be given to the blocking and attack of this defense. The slide 4-3, also 
known as the Miami 4-3 and the college 4-3, is becoming the defense of choice for 
many high school and college football teams. Having a sound plan to attack the 
slide 4-3 is vital to success at any level of play. Four staple plays of the Delaware 
Wing-T attack the slide 4-3 while placing defenders in conflict. 
For the sake of illustration, our discussion of conflict development in the slide 4-3 
begins with the buck sweep. On Right 21, the right wingback blocks down on the 
strongside defensive end. The tight end widens his split just enough to make the 
defensive end uncomfortable, and then blocks the gap-down rule. The gap-down 
rule for the tight end secures the “C” gap. If the Sam linebacker steps up in the “C” 
gap, the tight end will seal him inside. If the Sam linebacker does not step up to 
attack the “C" gap, the tight end will continue to the middle linebacker. The 
playside offensive tackle also blocks gap-down. By rule, the tackle will block inside 
on the 3 technique of the slide 4-3. However, Right 21 may be run after attacking the 
slide 4-3 with the fullback up the middle. 
lf the pressbox observer notices the defensive tackle closing to take the fullback, 
the offensive tackle is free to chip off the 3 technique to seal the middle linebacker. 
The playside guard short sweep pulls to a depth of 2 and '/2 yards to hammer block 
the force outward. If an immediate threat is aligned in the playside “A” gap, the 
center reaches the playside “A” gap. If there is no “A” gap defender on the line of 
scrimmage, the center check blocks for the backside pulling guard. The backside 
guard pulls flat past the center and gains depth to approximately two yards. The 
backside guard is responsible for inside leakage. In order to seal the leakage inside, 
the guard pulls to a point where his inside shoulder can brush the outside hip of the 
down blocking wingback. 
The backside tackle rips underneath as he sweeps across any defender aligned in 
his inside seam, including a backside 3 technique. Once the tackle dips underneath 
the “B” gap defender, he angles across the field at a depth of 15 yards and continues 
ona path toward the playside. He enters the alley and blindsides any defender who 
attempts to make the tackle on the ball. The primary target for the backside alley 
blocker is a cornerback or a safety who is attempting to make the tackle from a 
head-up or outside leverage position. The quarterback reverse pivots and opens 

eae 
ee ee ee re 
slightly past the midline while keeping the ball seated close to his stomach. The 
second step brings the quarterback around to a position 180 degrees from the 
starting point. The ball is presented into the halfback’s pocket as the quarterback's 
trail hand rolls over the top, securing the handoff. 
The halfback takes the handoff and runs parallel to the line of scrimmage in a 
manner to sell the threat around the defensive flank. Once the ball carrier reaches a 
point on the same vertical plane as the outside foot of the playside tackle's 
alignment, he digs. A dig move calls for the ball carrier to plant firmly on his outside 
foot and snap his shoulders back to parallel to hit the alley ona vertical line. Once 
he enters the alley, the ball carrier moves straight ahead while looking for the 
backside tackle’s alley block. As the tackle moves into position to crack the free 
safety, the ball carrier cuts back against the grain. If aligned opposite the play, the 
spread end will provide a touchdown breaking block. The quarterback helps slow 
the pursuit of the backside cornerback by executing a good fake with both hands on 
his hip as he bootlegs off of the handoff. The press box spotter pays special 
attention to the reaction of the free safety versus the buck sweep. If the free 
safety is flying to the alley and making the hit near the line of scrimmage, the 
waggle to the vertical receiver down the middle will burn the free safety fora 
SCOre.

The second consideration in assessing the defensive flow to the buck sweep is the 
internal defensive flow of the front. The buck sweep will be highly effective if the 
playside 3 technique squats inside to tackle the fullback. When the 3 technique 
attacks the down block of the playside tackle, the fullback dive series will rip the 
inside seam. Linebackers usually flow fast to the ball. The fast linebacker flow is 
usually ‘a result of the pulling playside guard combined with the threat to the near 
flank by the halfback in the 20 series. 
The combination of the fast flow of the middle linebacker and the 3 technique 
attacking the down block of the playside tackle opens the middle for the fullback 
dive. The available fullback quick hitters in the middle seam are 24 On, 24 Gut and 
24 Trap. Of the three fullback dives, 24 Gut best exploits the defensive conflicts 
created by the buck sweep. In the current unbalanced spread attack of the Wing-T, 
it is important to have an explosive fullback attack. A hard-hitting fullback can hurt 
the thinly spread defensive front. This truth has been confirmed in the recent 
history of the Delaware Wing-T. In recent seasons, the most productive play in the 
Delaware offense has been the 4 and 6 Gut. The reason for this productivity is two- 
fold. As mentioned, the first cause for the success of the 4 and 6 Gut is the 
defensive horizontal stress caused by the use of the spread and the unbalanced 
Wing-T formations. The second reason for the increased fullback production is the 
defensive trend toward penetration. 
Defensive penetration is now the common tactic used in trying to stop the Wing-T 
offense. More and more defensive coaches are cutting the defensive linemen free 
and allowing them to gap charge. Consequently, the linebackers with the dual 
assignment of flowing to the ball and stuffing the fullback trap are placed in 
conflict. The Wing-T coach must understand the co-dependence between the 
fullback game and the spread formation if that particular Wing-T style of offense is 
to be effective. 
On 24 Gut, the playside tight end rips under the defensive end and sprints to block 
the three-deep free safety or the two-deep weakside safety. The playside tackle 
chips through the playside 3 technique's outside shoulder. The aiming point of the 
tackle is through the feet of the 3 technique’s stance. If the linebacker plays the 
fullback dive, the tackle seals the playside linebacker. If the linebacker fast flows 
to meet the threat of 21, the tackle rips upfield to the inside pad of the linebacker. A 
flat path through the stance of the 3 technique is a key coaching point for the 
playside tackle. The penetrating tackle will move forward on the snap and give the 
tackle a clean shot on the linebacker. The center has an excellent angle on the slide 
4-3 weakside tackle. The weakside tackle is a weakside “A” gap defender. The 
center angle blocks the weakside tackle outward. The offside guard guts around 
the center's block to seal the weakside linebacker. The guard dips his outside 
shoulder and brushes the center's hip as he moves to the second level. If the 
linebacker has not arrived at the point of attack, the guard continues upfield to 

meet a safety. The backside tackle zone blocks the “B” gap while maintaining inside 
leverage on the 5 technique. 
Against the slide 4-3, the hole will normally open in the strongside “A” gap. If the 
weakside tackle slants strong, the center may wheel with him. The guard may be 
drilled on reading the strong slant of the nose as he bucket steps with his inside 
foot. If the gut blocking guard is unable to get around the center, he may slide up on 
the weakside shoulder of the center and wall out the weakside linebacker. The hole 
will adjust to straight over the center, and the fullback may break to the weakside 
"A" gap. This situation is a rare scenario against the slide 4-3. Nine times out of ten, 
the 24 Gut will rip a hole in the strongside “A” gap of the slide 4-3. The halfback 
sells the sweep, and the quarterback bootlegs to delay the safety pursuit. 
Another staple used to attack the slide 4-3 is the cross block belly. The play is run 
to the weakside. On the cross block, the playside tackle normally blocks down on 
the defensive tackle. Against the slide 4-3, the cross block may be called off by the 
tackle. If the cross block is called off, the playside tackle and the guard will angle 
block on the nearest lineman. On the “off” call, the tackle will block out and the 
guard will chip through the weakside tackle’s outside shoulder. The guard chips 
through the tackle’s shoulder by uppercutting his inside arm through the near armpit 
of the weakside tackle. This uppercut motion lifts the tackle and opens his 
shoulders. The lift and twist of the tackle’s upper body creates a blocking surface 
for the center. 
The center slides his head to the outside hip of the weakside tackle as both the 
guard and the center push the tackle upfield. The guard stays on the block as a lead 
blocker for approximately 1 and '/2 steps, at which point the guard releases off the 
defensive tackle and attacks the scraping linebacker. The guard seals the middle 
linebacker by placing his inside shoulder onto the outside hip of the linebacker. The 
key coaching point in the chip combination is the vertical push of the two blockers. 
Without a vertical push and a lift from the guard, the center will not be able to get 
around on the defensive tackle and log him inside. 
A wind-back lane is created by the backside guard and tackle gut blocking the 
backside 3 technique. The guard angle blocks out on the 3 technique, while the 
tackle bucket steps to come under the 3 technique. The tackle seals the strongside 
outside linebacker. The gut block backside creates a wide gash against the slide 4-3 
alignment with a penetrating 3 technique. The tight end bump releases inside and 
stutters his steps to check for a backside wheel technique out of the strong safety. 
lf the 4-3 is using an invert secondary scheme declared strong to the tight end, the 
strong safety may wheel inside on flow away and stop the wind-back for a short 
gain. The tight end wants to check the strong safety and, if necessary, wall him out 
of the wind-back lane. If the 4-3 is using a two-deep secondary scheme, the tight 
end will continue to the strongside safety.

The cross block is called off by the tackle when a second man aligns on the line of 
scrimmage to his outside. For example, if the weakside linebacker in the slide 4-3 
aligns on the line of scrimmage, the tackle will call “off” and base the 5 technique. 
The halfback listens for the tackle’s call and keeps his eyes up to recognize the 
alignment to which the call would be made. Once the halfback realizes the cross 
block is off, he takes a kick-out angle on the outside man. 
The coach cannot teach the halfback to simply block the linebacker. The linebacker 
may walk up on the line of scrimmage inside the 5 technique. In that case, the back 
would kick-out the 5 technique. 
The back kicks out the end man on an “off” call. If there is no off call, the halfback 
leads up on the playside linebacker. The back aims for the chin of the linebacker. At 
the moment of contact, the back slides his head outside the linebacker and 
executes a shoulder block with his inside shoulder. The shoulder block seals the 
linebacker and creates a crease between the end man and the linebacker. The 
quarterback reverse pivots across the midline and jabs the football into the 
fullback’s belly. The mesh is made as the quarterback faces a direction 
corresponding to 8 o'clock. The quarterback rides the fullback and snaps his hands 
to his hips as the fullback takes the handoff. The quarterback then continues on an 
option fake. The quarterback must never look back to the ball carrier, nor stop his 
fake until the whistle blows. The ball carrier recognizes the off call alignment and 
looks to hit the aforementioned seam between the end man and the sealed middle 
linebacker. 
The wind-back seam is always a good possibility against the off call. If no off call is 
made, the fullback hits the aforementioned seam between the end man and the 
sealed outside linebacker, looking to break the ball outside once he clears the seam. 
lf the outside linebacker maintains outside leverage, the extreme wind back may be 
open against the overflowing middle linebacker. Finally, the wingback three-step 
motions to get into the option pitch relationship with the quarterback. Like the 
quarterback, the wingback continues his faking assignment until the whistle blows. 
The wingback may also Z off his three-step motion to create a different facet of 
misdirection. 
The Sally is the fourth staple play the Wing-T coach may use to effectively attack 
the slide 4-3. On the Sally play, the fullback and the opposite wingback run the belly 
path. On a Sally back to the right, the fullback and the right halfback run their belly 
assignments to the left. The quarterback reverses out as he would on a belly. From 
the wingback position the left halfback jabs forward with his outside foot, then 
rocker steps backward with his inside foot as he pivots on his outside foot. The left 
halfback continues to a depth of three yards while moving parallel to the line of 
scrimmage. The timing of the play should be such that the quarterback and the left 
halfback mesh just as the halfback reaches the 3-yard depth. Once the halfback 
reaches the 3-yard tangent, the halfback pulls his upfield shoulder back. 

On a Sally play to the left halfback, the halfback will pull his left shoulder back as 
he takes the handoff. Pulling the shoulder back helps the halfback turn the horn and 
hit the line of scrimmage with his shoulders square. The handoff is an inside 
handoff. Therefore, the quarterback must operate at a depth of 3 and /2 yards as 
he comes off the fullback tail. The quarterback reverse pivots, pulls his lead 
shoulder back to square his shoulders and comes off the tail of the fullback to mesh 
with the ball carrier. The fullback runs the initial steps of the belly to a point 
corresponding to the point directly behind the tackle’s buttocks. Once the fullback 
reaches this plane, the fullback hammer steps to drive for the outside foot of the 
tackle. The fullback kicks out the end man on the line of scrimmage. The initial belly 
steps of the fullback to the vertical plane dissecting the tackle are a tremendously 
effective sell of the belly fake. The vertical attack of the fullback also allows him 
to use the hammer block step to guarantee a kick-out of the end man. Additional 
conflicts may be caused with a pass off the Sally action or an option off of the 
Sally action. 
Depending on the companion play most used with the Sally, the quarterback either 
continues at a depth of six yards to fake the Sally pass or comes off the Sally mesh 
to attack the inside shoulder of the force defender. The right wingback motions to 
the appropriate pitch relationship on the belly fake. Once the handoff is made, the 
right halfback slips into the flat. If the companion play is the option off of the Sally, 
the right halfback will simply continue in pitch relationship. The right halfback may 
use M motion to slip through the “C” gap to seal off a corner or a strong safety who 
is wheeling into the hole. Z motion allows the right halfback to pivot and attack the 
cornerback outside of the defensive end. Versus man-to-man coverage, the Z motion 
will widen the cornerback and prevent him from wheeling into the hole. 
The Sally play is effective as a fullback play or a quarterback play. Either player 
may carry the ball. On the fullback Sally, the fullback slide steps opposite the play 
and takes the handoff with his shoulders square. The quarterback reverse pivots 
and gives the ball to the fullback at a depth of three yards, as the fullback 
accelerates from his slide step. If desired, the fullback may use a crossover step 
and plant on the next step to drive back toward the “A” gap. 
The quarterback Sally is also an excellent play. The quarterback reverse pivots to 
the three-yard depth and completes the spin back to the line of scrimmage off of 
the fullback ride. The quarterback Sally is a throwback to the spinner tailback play 
of the single wing. 
Sally blocking is best described as a two-sided scheme. One side run blocks and the 
other side pass blocks. The ball hits back to the pass-block side. The run-block side

is in front of the mesh point. The run-side tackle and run-side guard fire block to the 
pass-block side. The tackle takes note of the presence of two men on the line of 
scrimmage to his outside. If there are two men outside of him on the line of 
scrimmage, the tackle calls “off” and area blocks the tackle with inside leverage. 
The guard will respond to the “off” call by the tackle with an area block on the near 
defender. The fullback hits the outside leg of the tackle. If there is no “off” call, the 
fullback will block the 5 technique. If there is an “off” call, the fullback will block 
the outside linebacker. 
The center jams the weak-shaded defensive tackle as he snaps the ball. The center 
uses his aggressive pass technique to punch and set. The center uses his shoulder 
to knock the nose toward the run blocking guard. The run blocking guard uses his 
fire technique to get around to the playside shoulder of the nose. The center then 
pushes off the shade nose to wall out the middle linebacker. The middle linebacker 
should react to the belly fake. This linebacker reaction should allow the center to 
catch the middle linebacker out of position. The pass side guard shows pass. If 
facing a definite outside shade, the guard opens his hips and shoulders to a 45- 
degree angle. Once the defender makes an upfield charge through the “B” gap, the 
guard drives his inside hand to the defender’s near hip and hip steers him upfield. 
If facing a head-up shade, the guard uses the three-step pass technique, keeping his 
shoulders square, jamming the defender on the snap and creating a cushion. The 
guard should attempt to position his inside leg to the crotch of the defender, inviting 
the defender outside. If the defender pushes across the face, the guard must pin the 
defender inside and drive him past the initial alignment of the run-side guard. The 
pass-side tackle mirrors the initial movement of the guard. He opens to a 45-degree 
angle against an outside-shaded lineman. If the lineman charges the “C” gap, the 
tackle uses the hip-steering method to drive the tackle into the backfield. If the 
lineman is not an outside shade, the tackle keeps his shoulders square and pass 
sets. If the lineman goes inside, the tackle rips through the defender’s outside 
shoulder and seals the inside linebacker. 
If either the guard or the tackle faces a man on him who simply sits on the line of 
scrimmage on the pass blocking set, the guard or tackle will attack the defender 
with inside leverage and drive him outward and back off the line of scrimmage. The 
tight end pass sets, then drives for the near Cover 2 safety. If there is a middle 
safety, the tight end drives downfield and stalks the middle safety. The tight end 
should pass set to the inside and invite the defensive end outside. If the defensive 
end attacks the “C” gap, the tight end releases through the defensive end's outside 
shoulder and proceeds upfield to stalk the free safety.

Attacking the 50 Defense 
The 50 defense faces conflict when attacked by the 21, 22, and 24 sequence. To 
stop the 24 series, the defensive tackle must close with the playside tackle’s down 
block. However, if closing with the tackle’s down block stops the 24 trap, the 
defensive tackle may be virtually passed over on the 21 play. If the defensive tackle 
is closing with the down block of the tackle, the tight end will just chip through the 
defensive tackle’s outside shoulder and seal the playside linebacker. A defensive 5 
technique cannot close with the down block of the tackle and make the play on the 
21, even if he is only chipped by the tight end. For one thing, the backside guard 
provides insurance against the exceptionally athletic 5 technique. If an athletic 5 
technique comes off the closure of the “B” gap to play a role in defending the 21, the 
backside guard should shield him from the ball carrier as he pulls to wall in the 
pursuit. Once the backside guard clears the center, he begins to look inside for 
leakage. The backside guard accounts for any leakage which may occur before (and 
after) the ball carrier enters the alley. 
The hallmark of the 50 defense is a dominating player at the nose position. As 
mentioned earlier in the text, the 50 defense must assign an extra seam to one of 
its front players. The player who most commonly draws the dual assignment 
against the Wing-T is the nose. Two principle styles of nose play exist—slanting 
quickness at the nose and anchoring strength at the nose. Each style presents its 
own unique considerations, but both are vulnerable to the all of the 24 plays. 
Against the slanting defense, 24 On is most easily executed. The fullback simply 
cuts opposite the slant. Big gainers against a slanting nose with 24 On will slow 
down the linebackers and undermine the advantage of the slanting front. The 
productivity of 24 On can be enhanced with a gut block on the backside with the 6 
guard and 7 tackle. The gut block is effective if the offensive signal caller picks up 
on a pattern of the slant. The play is called to the slant and gut blocked on the 
backside. An excellent play against the anchor nose is 24 Wedge. 
The 50 defense uses an anchor nose primarily to free the other interior seam 
defenders to play a one-gap responsibility. In many cases, the 50 defense will 
present two outside shade tackles. When facing this style of 50 defense with a 
dominating two-gap nose player, the Wing-T coach calls 24 Wedge. The wedge 
scheme allows both guards to glide step against the nose tackle as the center 
posts the nose. The triple team invariably flips even the best nose on his back after 

he is carried downfield. A huge laceration of the 50 defense results as the tackles 
glide inside up to the linebackers. The 5 technique tackles are left alone. Even if 
unblocked, the “B” gap attacking defensive tackle cannot stop the 24 wedge. 
A special play to use against the straight 50 defense is the 40 series drive. The 40 
series drive is a play from the early days of Don Faurot’s Split 1. On the 42 drive, the 
quarterback opens to the fullback dive behind the playside guard. The backside 
tackle cuts off backside and sprints to the alley. The backside guard cutoff blocks 
to the backside linebacker. The playside guard trap pulls to kick out the first man 
who shows outside the double team on the 5 technique. The guard will most likely 
block the defensive end. The playside tackle posts the 5 technique and the tight end 
glides inside from a good split to double team the 5 technique. lf the 5 technique 
disappears inside, the double team converts to a bump lead. The wingback 
influences the end and blocks out on the invert force or stalks the safety. The 
fullback meshes behind the tail of the playside guard and fakes the veer dive. The 
quarterback rides the fullback and comes off the mesh. 
The quarterback footwork must be precise and balanced to meet the mesh with the 
trail halfback. The quarterback visualizes stepping on an egg on his second step off 
the ride. The third step off the ride puts him in mesh position behind the tail of the 
tackle. The halfback gets this shoulders square and meshes with the quarterback. 
The quarterback gives the ball to the halfback and continues outside with his hands 
on his hips.

An effective alternative blocking scheme to use with this play is the 3-step motion 
from the right wingback back against the direction of the play. The motioning 
wingback can reverse his direction just prior to the snap and lead through the 
outside leg of the tackle. In this case, the wingback replaces the tight end glide lead 
block on the double team. The tight end flexes four feet to stretch the “C” gap and 
blocks the defensive end outward. The tackle post blocks for the wingback bump 
lead block. 
An important coaching point for the wingback is to stay on the tackle double team 
until there is movement on the tackle. If the tackle disappears inside, the wingback 
naturally leads up on the playside linebacker if the linebacker shows. The wingback 
will seal any inside leakage. If there is no leakage, the wingback will continue to the 
free safety. In this scheme, the playside guard doubles the nose. The hard dive of 
the fullback and the down block of the playside guard will cause the playside 
linebacker to step up and meet the fullback. The backside cuts off the backside 
penetration. The quarterback and halfback carry out the same assignment as with 
the previous scheme.

Diagram 11-3: Rip M 42 Drive Pass. 
Many Wing-T plays present the 50 defense with conflict. For example, the trap 
option series from the Spread 100 and 900 formation will hurt the 50 invert. The trap 
option reverse can be a big play against the grain.

WING-T SUMMARY 
The Wing-T is designed to be simply executed. However, due to its multiple nature 
the Wing-T is not a simple offense to defend. The simplicity of the Wing-T system 
is grounded in the small number of blocking schemes. The multiplicity is a feature 
generated by the three primary play series run from several formations. In fact, the 
predominant feature of the Delaware Wing-T attack currently employed is the use 
of unbalanced formations. 
As mentioned earlier in the text, the Wing-T has nine numbered points of attack. 
The nine points of attack are specific points within three main attack areas: the 
perimeter (outside), of f-tackle and between the tackles. The Wing-T challenges 
these three areas through direct attacks and misdirection. A feature of the 
Delaware Wing-T offense is the concept of staple plays. Staple plays are plays 
which may be run from any Delaware Wing-T formation. The basic staple running 
plays of the Delaware Wing-T package include: 
e 
The belly series plays—the belly dive and belly option—identified as the 80 
series 
e 
The buck sweep plays—the sweep, trap, and waggle—identified as the 20 
series 
e 
The Sally series 
e 
The power series 
The Delaware Wing-T running game has evolved into a multiple spread formation 
offense with unbalanced formation principles. This spread of the defense has led 
the Delaware Wing-T to become more of a balanced run and pass attack. In recent 
years, the spread philosophy of formations has allowed key players to rank among 
the nation's statistical leaders in the passing game. With each new innovation, the 
Delaware Wing-T continues to evolve as a visionary offensive system.

66 | can think of no one more qualified than Tubby 
Raymond to teach all of the basic elements of foot- 
ball, especially the Delaware Wing-T. He’s always been 
a wonderful teacher and motivator. This is a great 
opportunity for anyone interested in this style of foot- 
ball to learn from the best.

66 Tubby Raymond is the absolute authority on the 
Wing-T offense. Many of the plays and principles of 
the Wing-T can be incorporated into other offenses, 
therefore, every coach should study his books. They 
will most likely give the coach some new ideas.

University of Michigan 
66 Tubby is the guru of the Wing-T. Like E.F. Hutton, when he speaks, everyone listens. 
Tubby is the #1 nationally acknowledged expert and source reference for informa- 
tion on the Wing-T. He has updated and modernized a once conservative offense 
into an unstoppable gridiron machine. Tubby in my mind is one of the truly great 
coaches of all time.
