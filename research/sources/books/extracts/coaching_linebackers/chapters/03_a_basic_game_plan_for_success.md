A Basic Game Plan for Success
A multiple eight-man front (eight defensive players around the ball) involving four
linebackers
is a basic defensive scheme which we have successfully used over the
years.
This scheme employs four linebackers (two inside and two outside) who can
be aligned in various positions depending on the defense called.
Having the ability
to position eight defenders around the ball provides more immediate support against
the run. The flexibility of the defensive scheme allows the team to adjust its defenses
to many different types of offenses. Some of the basic different alignments which
are employed from this scheme include:
SPLIT 6 (BASIC DEFENSE)
Strong Side

Disadvantages:
•
It
is difficult to cover the strong side flat pass zone by an outside linebacker
who
is aligned on the tight end.
•
The outside linebackers are not aligned
in an advantageous position to support
against plays that are run up the middle of the defense.
•
Being a balanced defense,
it is impossible to overshift in the directon of the opponent's
strength.

Strong Side

Advantages:
•
The defense provides more support for the middle and off-tackle holes.
•
This scheme decreases the number of seams in the defense because of the man
on-man alignment.
•
The defense
is overshifted to the strength of the offense.
This makes
it an
especially good defense to be played when the ball
is on or close to a hash
mark.
•
An opportunity exists to have a balanced three-man pass rush.
•
The outside linebacker on the strong side of the field
is in better position to play
the "flat" pass zone.
Disadvantages:
•
Immediate run support
is unavailable against outside plays which are run to the
weak side (away from the offense's strength).
•
The inside linebackers are not in an advantageous position to pursue outside
plays quickly or get to their pass zones quickly.
•
A defensive end must get involved
in pass coverage in order to cover the
underneath passing zones.

Disadvantages:
•
The middle of the defense
is more vulnerable to the run because the middle
linebacker aligns in a softer position (i.e., off the line of scrimmage).
•
Immediate run support in unavailable against outside plays which are run to the
weak side (away from the offense's strength).
•
Except for the strong side outside linebacker, the linebackers are not aligned in
a good position to retreat quickly to their passing zones.
•
The inside linebacker who is aligned on the strong side is not in an advantageous
position to pursue outside running plays.

Each of these different schemes will usually cause many blocking adjustments by the
offense. They also provide you with the potential for a wide variety of games (stunts).
If you use a multiple eight-man front, your defense can play with reckless abandon,
however, your linebackers must be aggressive and want to make things happen.
The
flexibility afforded by this basic defensive scheme places a relatively greater burden
upon your linebackers because they must be able to recognize plays from the various
alignments.
Having eight people around the ball also makes
it more difficult for the
linebackers to play zone pass defense because there are greater distances for them
to run to their pass zones.
All of those situations require that your linebackers in this
defensive scheme must be alert, intelligent, and highly mobile in order to handle their
assignments.

What Are the General Responsibilities of a Linebacker?
In order to understand the proper approach to coaching linebackers,
it is necessary
to understand the basic responsibilities of linebackers.
Within a coaches' defensive
game plan, each defense used
is designed to stop certain offensive plays.
Toward
that end, the linebackers' assignments will vary with the defenses that are called.
Some general assignments, however, exist which linebackers must be able to handle
to effectively play within the Penn State defensive scheme.
Our linebackers must be able to:
•
Diagnose running plays, provide strong support to the defensive linemen, and
control their areas of responsibility.
•
Recognize and quickly take the proper angle of pursuit against outside plays
(sweeps, options, etc.).
Inside linebackers pursue from inside to outside (refer
to diagram 4-1
), keeping the ball carrier on their outside shoulder (the shoulder
on the side of the direction
in which they are going).
Outside linebackers should
pursue straight down the line of scrimmage or give ground slightly once the ball
has gotten outside of them (refer to diagram 4-2).

DIAGRAM 4-2
•
Blitz (immediately attack an offensive area on the snap of the ball).
•
Play zone pass defense (covering a specific area of the field—flats, curls,
middle).
•
Play man-for-man pass defense (covering an offensive receiver).
In this area of
responsibility, a linebacker can either approach his duties cautiously (covering an
offensive receiver when you do not have deep help) or aggressively (taking away
the passes in the area from the line of scrimmage to eighteen yards deep, knowing
that deep help
is available).
•
Recognize the offensive formation and make adjustments to unanticipated
situations.
The ability of each linebacker usually determines the defensive alignment.
If all
backers are of equal ability,
it is generally most advantageous to simply align them
according to sides (left and right).
However,
if your linebackers are more or less
capable in certain areas,
it may be necessary to align them in various positions
according to the placement of the football (i.e., short side vs. wide side) or the type
of offensive formations being used
(i.e., weak side vs. strong side (refer to diagrams
4.3a and 4.3b).
