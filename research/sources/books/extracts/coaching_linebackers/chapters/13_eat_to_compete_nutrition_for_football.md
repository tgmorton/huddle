Eat to Compete: Nutrition For Football
Research has shown that coaches can be important sources of nutrition information
for athletes—particularly the adolescent athlete.
Because the nutritional habits that
an individual develops in high school usually continue throughout his college athletic
career and into adulthood,
it is critical that coaches encourage their athletes to
adhere to sound nutritional practices. While almost all available data on the subject
indicates that no single food will make an individual into a champion, a corresponding
amount of evidence suggest that poor nutritional habits can— in fact—prevent an
athlete from playing up to his genetic potential.
Besides the effect on an individual's
gridiron performance, an unsound diet will also have a negative affect on a player's
health—an impact of profound importance.
In order to be able to offer sound advice concerning nutrition fundamentals, a
coach
should be able to address and answer the following three questions (issues) with his
players;
• What should be included
in a training diet?
• What should be eaten the day before a game?
• What should be eaten for a pre-game meal?
The Training Diet
Calories for growth, development, basal metabolism, and physical activity are derived
from three main sources:
carbohydrates, protein and fat.
While
it is true that alcohol
can contribute many calories to an individual's diet, this drug
is not
a useful source
of calories for competitive athletes (or for anyone else for that matter).
Since the major energy source for muscular contraction
is derived from stored
carbohydrates
in the form of liver and muscle glycogen, the diet should be high
in
carbohydrates, A diet that
is 55 to 60% carbohydrates will maintain glycogen stores
during the training season. When too
little carbohydrate
is eaten, these stores
become low.
After several days on a low carbohydrate diet in combination with daily
two-hour workouts, muscle glycogen levels can decrease to less than 50% of normal.
These low levels can contribute to feelings of tiredness, soreness, and general
fatigue.
If humans had to depend only on their glycogen stores to support daily living
activities, we would run out of energy in less than 24 hours.
Because of this
inadequate amount and because athletes rely on these stores for the majority of their
energy expenditure, a diet high
in carbohydrate
is necessary.
131

Not only is
it recommended that an athlete's diet be high
in carbohydrates, but the
sources of his carbohydrates should be mostly complex carbohydrate or starch.
Foods
such as pasta, bread, muffins, bagels, rice, potatoes, and cereals are recommended
rather than foods high in simple sugar.
While
it is true that sweet foods such as soda
pop, candy, and desserts contribute to glycogen stores, these foods do not contain
other essential vitamins and minerals.
For this reason, athletes are encouraged to
eat the more nutrient dense, starch foods rather than sweets to build muscle glycogen.
Because any players feel that they need a snack before afternoon practice, they often
reach for a candy bar and can of soda. While this sugar snack does provide a feeling
of well-being and give "energy" during the early stages of practice, they may find that
after about 30 to 60 minutes a feeling of sluggishness sets in
. The reason for this
sluggishness
is that the sugar in the snack does not maintain the blood sugar level
as long as a snack would which combines protein, fat, and carbohydrate. A better
snack before practice would be a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cheese and
crackers, or a piece of fruit.
Most athletes find
it surprising that their protein needs are not as high as they
believe.
It is true that athletes require more protein than non-athletes.
It is also true
that growing athletes require more protein than adult athletes.
However, the extra
food that is eaten to support growth and the athletic activity fulfills the protein needs
of the athlete.
In this way the athlete
is eating both calories and protein for growth
and muscle development. An example of how an athlete can fulfill his need for protein
is as follows:
T. D. Smith
is a 17 year old football player and weighs 190 lbs. (86.4 kilograms).
He
requires between
1 .0 and
1 .5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
From these
calculations then, he needs to eat between 86 and 129 grams of protein each day.
T. D.
could obtain
1
1
grams of protein from eating two low-fat yogurts, three ounces of baked
chicken breast, one cup of green peas, and four, eight-ounce cartons of skim milk.
The
vegetable protein contributed by complex carbohydrates will easily push T D. beyond his
actual requirement.
It
is not unusual to find that football players consume two to three times the amount
of protein that they need to continue to grow and develop more muscle. The research
is not clear about the hazards of eating excessive amounts of protein over a long
period of time.
It is known, however, that excessive consumption of protein
is not
beneficial for athletes. Two basic arguments exist for encouraging athletes not to
consume excessive amounts of protein.
First of all, protein that the body does not
need
is not stored as protein.
Depending on the energy needs of the body, this extra
protein
is stored as fat or used for energy.
To use dietary protein as a source of
energy is a very inefficient metabolic process.
Dietary carbohydrate
is a much better
source of energy.
Secondly, when extra dietary protein
is metabolized,
its nitrogen
protein
is excreted
in the urine in the form of urea.
In order to excrete these large
132

diets increase the athlete's risk of dehydration.
For these two reason,
it
is
recommended that approximately 15% of the calories come from the protein in foods.
Many advertisements promote the use of "protein drinks" or "protein powders" for
weight gain or increases
in muscle mass.
These products typically contain both a
carbohydrate and a protein source and simply add extra calories to the athlete's diet.
It is true that muscular development does not occur without enough calories, but the
typical high school or collegiate football player eats enough protein and calories for
muscle growth.
If a player buys one of these expensive products in the hopes of
gaining weight, his money would be better spent by eating "normal food" more often
during the day so that he has more opportunities to consume more calories. When
liquid supplements are preferred for between meal snacks, instant breakfast drinks
made with 2% milk can be used. These instant drinks can be purchased at a
supermarket and are much less expensive than weight gain powders.
While weight gain and muscle building powders continue to be advertised, a newer
addition to the marketplace
is single amino acid supplements.
It is true that amino
acids are the "building blocks" of proteins since all proteins are made up of amino
acids.
It is also true that eight are considered to be "essential"—that
is, these eight
amino acids cannot be made or synthesized by the body and must be eaten. What is
not true, however,
is that supplements of amino acids are needed by healthy football
players.
For example, one egg, two eight-ounce cartons of milk and a three-ounce
hamburger provides an excess of essential amino acids for a 170 pound young athlete.
Unfortunately, however, eating an excessive amount of amino acids can have a
negative impact on an athlete.
Just as described above, they will not be stored as
amino acids in the body, but will be inefficiently utilized or stored as fat. Amino acid
supplementation also has the potential to increase the risk of dehydration.
Furthermore, they are very expensive.
In the past several years, arginine and ornithine—two amino acids that the body
makes plenty of—have been promoted for their growth hormone releasing capabilities.
They are advertised to athletes under the guise that in high amounts, these amino
acids can stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.
It is
further believed that extra growth hormone causes larger muscles. The facts about
arginine and ornithine are as follows:
• When administered to people with a suspected growth hormone deficiency,
these amino acids are used to see
if the growth hormone secretion
is normal.
• Because the liver quickly metabolizes the extra amino acids not required by
the body,
it is unlikely that these oral supplements have any effect on growth
hormone release.
133

• Adults with diseases that cause an abnormally large secretion of growth
hormone are not necessarily thin or good athletes.
Quite to the contrary, they
suffer from acromegaly.
This disorder causes disfiguring enlargements of the
bones of the face, hands and feet. They also sometimes suffer from symptoms
similar to those of diabetes.
Similar to the aforementioned discussion on protein, the money spent for these amino
acids would be much better spent on high carbohydrate foods to increase muscle
glycogen stores.
The final nutrient in the training diet that provides calories
is fat. As might be
expected, the recommendation for fat consumption for the high school or collegiate
football player
is lower than what is typically consumed. Many athletes obtain 40%
of their calories from fat, although a diet which has a fat content of 30% or lower is
recommended.
Often calories from fat are not readily obvious.
Since one teaspoon
of margarine, butter,
oil, or mayonnaise contains 45 calories and
is pure fat,
it is
relatively easy to eat much more fat than you would expect.
Since foods that are
high
in complex carbohydrates or starches are not high
in fat, an athlete's fat intake
normally tends to decrease as he eats more carbohydrates.
Fluids are also an important factor in the training diet. The best fluid replacer for a
football player
is cool water.
Fluids that contain sugar are not emptied from the
stomach or intestinal tract as quickly as water.
If players believe that they need a
sugared beverage, diluting a commercial drink with three parts of water to one part
beverage
is a good compromise.
Excessive water loss through perspiration can lead to a dangerous situation for a
football player. A loss of only 3% of the body weight can lead to impaired
performance, while heat exhaustion can begin when 5% of the body's weight has
been
lost.
To avoid this, athletes should be required to drink water before practice,
during practice, and after practice.
Each one pound of weight lost during practice or
a game should be replaced with two cups of water.
The Meals Eaten the Day Before the Game
If a player
is eating a diet that is normally high
in carbohydrates, he may not need to
make any dietary changes the day before a game. Many players use the day before
to eat foods high
in carbohydrate to maximize their glycogen stores.
Since glycogen
synthesis takes several hours, there
is time to do this the day before, but not the day
of a game.
Several hours are also needed to ensure maximal hydration of the body.
The night before an early afternoon game
is also a good time to drink extra water.
The Pre-Game Meal
The purpose of the pre-game meal
is two-fold.
First of all,
it should keep the players
from getting hungry during the game.
Secondly, the pre-game meal
is important to
134

from getting hungry during the game.
Secondly, the pre-game meal
is important to
provide fluids to maintain or improve the players' hydration status.
Beyond these
two guidelines,
it
is difficult to make specific recommendations because many
psychological factors have been linked to the pre-game meal.
For many players this
meal
is smaller than other meals. As a standard rule of thumb, most nutritionist
recommend that a pre-game meal should contain approximately 500 calories.
Furthermore, this meal usually should not contain spicy foods, unless these are
typically consumed.
It should be low in fat, because fat slows the emptying of the
stomach.
Food
left in the stomach and intestinal tract at the beginning of the game
may cause nausea or cramping.
Since anxiety and excitement also slow digestion,
a high fat meal can add to these gastrointestinal problems.
Players who are
particularly bothered by anxiety may prefer to drink liquid meals. These are emptied
from the stomach faster than a meal of solid food.
Once again, the fluid of choice at the pre-game meal
is water.
If the team eats
together at a restaurant, coaches should request that pitches of cold water be put on
the tables.
The availability of water may encourage players to refill their glass more
often.
While coffee, tea, and cola beverages are high
in water, these are not
recommended because of the caffeine content.
Caffeine acts as a diuretic and a
central nervous system stimulant.
Caffeine can cause water loss from the body and
can increase an athlete's level of nervous excitement before the game.
Conclusion
Nutrition recommendations for athletes have undergone dramatic changes in the past
fifteen years.
Unfortunately, while the amount of interest and research
in sports
nutrition has greatly increased the knowledge available to coaches and athletes, the
level of nutrition misinformation has also flourished.
Hopefully, the recommendations,
explanations, and ideas presented
in this chapter will help you answer your players'
questions and contribute to their winning performance.
