# How to Evaluate Your Players' Performance

How to Evaluate Your Players' Performance
Following every game, the coach should evaluate the game films.
This review is
usually done on the Sunday immediately following a Saturday game.
The purpose of
this undertaking
is to evaluate techniques, coaching decisions, and personnel
in order
to make sure that the right people are being played
in the appropriate positions and
situations.
After reviewing the films, the coach should have identified each player's
mistakes, the steps which should be taken to correct these mistakes, and how each
player has contributed to the total effort.
It is important also that the players have
some knowledge of the results of the evaluations of their performance.
If a player
has performed well, a report of this fact can serve as an incentive and provide
motivation;
if a player has performed poorly, he should know what mistakes he made
so that he (together with his coach) can take steps
correct them.
An elaborate or complex performance grading system
is neither necessary nor
particularly worthwhile.
With so many variables in grading,
it
is very difficult to be
completely objective.
Certain intangibles, such as how one player complements
another, literally cannot be measured.
The grading system can be used to help make
personnel decisions but should not be the only factor An elaborate evaluation system
should not be used since
it would require a fair amount of time to grade, and thereby
possibly detracting from the time available to prepare for the next opponent.
In most
instances (at the collegiate level particularly),
it
is also not necessary to have signs,
gimmicks, or rewards — evaluation sheets given to the individual player are usually
sufficient.
The linebacker evaluation sheet should be designed so that each linebacker has the
results of his performance on one sheet of paper (refer to Figure 13-1).
Space should
be provided for:
• The total number of plays.
• The number of unassisted tackles made (i.e., the linebacker would have made
the tackle without assistance).
• The number of assisted tackles made (i.e., The linebacker contributed to the
tackle).
• The number of "great hits"
(i.e., a superior tackle).
• The number of "bonus plays:"
- causing a fumble.
- recovering a loose ball.
- making a tackle for a three or more yard loss.

- making an interception.
- deflecting a pass.
-
blocl<ing a kick.
- making a crucial play (i.e., a key tackle in a short yardage situation, a
touchdown saving tackle, etc.).
- making a tackle inside the opponent's twenty yard line on a kickoff.
- making a tackle on a punt for no gain.
- making a tackle for a safety.
The number of "loafs"
(i.e., anytime that the ball
is in play and the linebacker
is not going full speed).
The number of poor plays (i.e., violating a principle and not making the play,
missing a tackle, not using good judgment, etc.)
Comments:
- pertinent remarks about the linebacker's performance.
-
critical statements about incorrect play.
- suggestions for improvement and correction of mistakes.
- a good comment about a job well done (i.e., only exceptional performance or
effort).
- a general statement of the overall performance.
