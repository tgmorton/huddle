How to Keep Your Players' Minds in the Game
While
it is important to practice well, a team must also perform well. Many players
respond differently in a game situation; some rise to the occasion, while others seem
to become too nervous to function
effectively.
Still others enjoy the thrill of a crowd
and play much better than expected.
Most great players have uncanny timing and
natural instincts for the "big play."
Because
it appears that the majority of these
characteristics are primarily innate, the coach has little or no control over them.
It
is important, however, that coaches and players talk as much as possible about
each game situation and the
little things that might make the difference between
success and failure.
First,
it is necessary that the players be able to recognize the
most common plays that will be run by their opponent and understand the blocking
schemes that go with those plays.
Next
, the players should be able to recognize
offensive formations and backfield sets and know the characteristics of each.
Finally,
the players should be aware of down and distance situations, offensive strategy, big
plays, field position, and critical situations.
The Opponent's Basic Plays
As a general rule, each of your opponents will exhibit certain offensive tendencies.
Accordingly, each of these teams has specific plays that
it tends to run
in particular
situations.
These plays should be identified and defined so that everyone has a
thorough understanding of these plays. A few of the offensive plays which are
relatively popular (and commonly used) in high school and college football are
illustrated in diagrams 10-1
to 10-6.
Most great players have uncanny timing
and natural instincts for the "big play.

Understanding Offensive Formations
Linebackers should be alert to a team's offensive tendencies. Most teams will run
only certain plays from a particular formation.
Because each formation creates a
unique problem, a linebacker should be able to adjust more quickly and anticipate
better
if he can recognize the formation and its basic characteristics. The linebacker
should anticipate but not guess.
Inside linebackers should always call out the strength of the formation and the type
of backfield set, for example, "Flanker left, 1° backs".
Examples of several of the most
common backfield sets and their characteristics include the following:
• 1" backs
DUfiRiW 1fr7
Features:
-
Basically, this formation facilitates a tailback-oriented offense.
It enables the
tailback to hit quickly in a lot of different holes.
-
It facilitates a strong outside running game to either side (options, sweeps,
etc.).
- Most teams use play action passes or challenge the perimeter with the run-
pass option.
- Other basic plays include the sprint draw, isolation, off tackle, buck, veer,
veer option, and passes off those plays.
102

• -T" backs — the halfback is set away from the strength of the formation.
DIAGRAM IM
^^^^strongest running play is the "belly" to the side of the "set" halfback.
- The set halfback (number two) is more of a pass threat.
(Flare control and
weak-side flood game).
- Most of the running game to the flanker-side
is off counter action.
. Tower" backs — the halfback is set to the strength of the formation.
Features:

DIAGRAM IM
"ThTprimary purpose of this set is to be able to flood the flanker-side zones
(get three receivers out), usually off sprint action or semi-sprmt action passes.
- The strongest running plays are the sweep and belly to the flanker- side.
103

•
Full house "T" or solid backfleld.
DIAGRAM 10-10
Features:
-
This formation facilitates a power running set, usually revolving around the
fullback.
-
Basic plays off this formation include the belly, the belly option, and the belly
pass.
-
This formation
is very balanced because of the lead back to both sides.
-
Counters are easily run because of the closeness of all the backs.
• Pow/er
"I".
DIAGRAM 10-11
Features:
-
This formation offers another power running set.
-
This formation
is very similar to the
"I" with a stronger off tackle game
(isolation and belly) to the power side and better counter game away from
the strength of the formation.
- The isolation and the blast option are the basic plays away from the strength
of the formation.
104

• "Wishbone."
DIAGRAM 10^12
Features:
-
This formation is very similar to the fullhouse "T° except that everything is
quicker.
The backs are in better position to run the option and to get to
either side quickly.
- The passing game comes off play action.
• "Tight" split backs.
DIAGRAM 1IM3
Features:
-
This formation
is designed to facilitate another quick-hitting offense.
- The basic running plays are the veers, (inside and outside) veer option,
counters, counter options, and lead draw.
- The passing game
is usually play action (pop pass, boots, etc.)
10S

"Wide" split backs.
DIAGRAM IfrU
Features:
-
This formation primarily offers passing set (five-man out patterns and floods).
- The basic running plays are the pro sweep, quick pitch, trap, and off
tackle.
-
Play action passes are usually the boot and sweep pass.
Examples of several of the various offensive formations and their characteristics
include the following:
• Pro-flanker left.
DIAGRAM 10^15
Features:
- The strongest running plays are usually to the flanker side.
-
It is a good passing formation, especially with two wide receivers.
106

Wide slot — flanker left.
DIAGIAM 10-16
Features:

j,
a
- The strongest running plays are usually directed away from the flanker side
to the tight end.
- The slot creates a good counter game back to the tight end.
• "Twins" — flanker left.
DIAGRAM 1M7
Features:
This is a commonly used formation which teams employ in an
attempt to get
their opponents to reduce the eight-man defensive front;
it forces you to
remove one linebacker.
107

- The action-pass game to the twins
is very strong; many different combinations
are possible.
- The most common plays used in this formation are the off tackle and down-
the-line option to the twins, and off tackle plays away from the twins.
"Tight" wing or "tight" slot — flanker left.
Wing

'Tight' double wing.

0008000 o
DIAGRAM 1IM9
Features
This formation is designed to facilitate a misdirection offense with the guards
pulling quite often.
- The basic plays are counters (counter sweep, etc.), traps, the belly option,
and power sweep.
- The passing game is off action, mostly counter and boot action.
"Pro" double wing.
Features
DIAGRAM 10^20
This formation basically a passing formation (four quick receivers).
The most frequently thrown passes off of this fonnation are floods, delays, and
deep passes.
The running game is limited without motion.
Most teams run the draw, trap,
and down the line option.
109

"Trips."
DUGRAM llhZI
Features:
- This formation is a passing formation, primarily used to flood the formation
("trips") side.
- As a running formation,
it is usually limited to a sweep or trap.
Game Situations
Linebackers should be aware of many different situations which arise during a game.
They should be alert and flexible, and able to rapidly adjust their play. While each
team has its own personality, several general guidelines exist which linebackers
should adhere to during a game:
• Anticipate run or pass and adjust your alignment in the obvious situation.
• Anticipate, but do not guess; big defensive plays come about by recognition
and going full speed on every play.
• Do not let your opponent out of the defense's four-down area (i.e., keep them
inside their thirty-five yard line).
• Come up with a "big play" between the thirty-five yard lines.
Try not to let
them get into their four-down area with ease.
• Realize that once your opponent crosses your thirty-five yard line, he is in four-
down territory.
Most teams will use their most consistent plays and stay patient; the closer
that they get to the goal-line, the tougher
it gets to make yardage.
Near the
goal-line, the defense has less area to defend against the pass and as a result
can, play more aggressively against the run.
• Know the score and the amount of time remaining.
110

Many games are won or lost in the last two minutes. The following factors are
important to remember when trying to prevent a score:
• Be aware of what
it will take for the opponent to win (a touchdown or a field
goal).
• The outside linebackers should go out on the wide receivers
if they are playing
the flat zone.
Inside linebackers should deepen.
• The outside linebackers should think of covering square outs and quick outs.
• Everyone should attempt to keep the ball carrier in the field of play.
• Stay alert for a quick line-up. Some opponents will align quickly after a first
down. A few might even run two or three plays without huddling.
• Realize that the clock
is stopped after a first down until the chains have been
moved.
• Don't panic!
Equally important, don't give the appearance of losing your
composure.
The opposite situation arises when the defense must get the ball back in order to
win.
In this situation the defensive players should:
• Try to make a "big play."
Don't panic, however, and start playing a "helter-
skelter" type defense.
• Keep their poise and stay together.
• Get off pile ups quickly and move into/out of the huddle rapidly.
• Know how many time-outs that their team has left and be ready to utilize them
wisely. The offense can stop the clock without calling "time-out."
• Realize that the clock stops in certain situations (e.g., when a pass
is
incomplete, the ball carrier goes out of bounds, or the ball changes hands). A
defensive team must not "waste" a "time-out" (i.e., call) in these situations.
