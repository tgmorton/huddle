# Drills— Individual

Drills— Individual
Through individual drills a linebacker can be instructed in and given the opportunity
to practice the fundamentals and principles of proper play.
All linebackers should be
drilled in these fundamentals so that they are able to develop proper, game-like
habits. A v\/ell-organized drill can provide the basic foundation for a good performance.
All drills should be well-planned by you before going to the practice field.
Before
practice starts, you should:
• Make a checklist of all of the situations which might occur during a game and
make sure that you have designed appropriate drills for improving such areas.
• Understand and clearly define the purpose of every drill.
• Evaluate each drill as to whether
it is serving
its intended purpose; consult
with the players to see what benefits they believe that they are getting out of
the drills.
• Devise or emphasize certain drills to address particular problems your players
may have or your opponents may present.
• Organize the time allotted for individual
skill improvement drills so that the
most important objectives are reached.
• Organize the drills according to the number of players involved and the space
available.
• Make sure that the necessary equipment for the drills
is in the proper place on
the field prior to the start of practice.
• Fully explain the drill,
its purpose, and the planned rotation before you have
your players attempt
it.
Once practice begins all the drills should move quickly.
The tempo should be quick.
Everything should be done with a maximum effort — just as
if
it were an actual game
setting.
Structure your drills so that very little standing around occurs.
It is usually
a good practice to avoia staying on one drill too long.
If a player executes the
fundamental correctly once,
it should be sufficient.
You should guard against
monotony as much as possible and attempt to
instill competition between players
whenever possible.
You should also indicate the proper techniques to the players;
showing them the drill once and have them do
it as many times as necessary— if a
drill
is not done correctly,
it should be repeated.
It is important, however, not to slow
everyone down for the sake of one person.
If a player repeatedly performs a drill
incorrectly, he should receive individual instruction at a different time.
Movement Drills
All drills should begin with the linebacker(s) in a proper stance.
If more than one
linebacker is involved, a command of "break" should be used to get them into their
69

stance. Some of the typical drills that we have used at Penn State to develop a
number of highly successful linebackers include the following:
• Lateral Start Drill (one slide) — The purpose of this drill
is to teach linebackers
the proper techniques for initiating lateral movement.
DIAGRAM 81
The coach has the linebackers stand in a straight line facing him. With a hand signal,
the coach directs them to slide once in the direction that he points and then come to
a complete stop, while maintaining their stance.
He then repeats a signal for them
to move one slide
in the same or opposite direction.
After a number of slides, the
coach points straight ahead and the players turn and run full speed in a straight line
for a distance of five yards looking back over their shoulder at the coach.
• Continual Sliding Drill (shuffling) — The purpose of this drill
is to teach
linebackers the proper techniques for sustaining lateral movement.
DIAGRAM 82
70

The drill
is organized in the same manner as the lateral start drill.
The difference
between the drills
is that when the coach signals to one side, the players continue
to slide in that direction until the coach gives them a signal to stop (all while
maintaining a good stance).
The coach then gives a signal to slide in the opposite
direction.
After a number of direction changes, the coach signals, and the players
sprint in the same manner as the conclusion of the lateral start drill.
• Lateral Run Drill (crossover) — The purpose of this drill
is to teach
linebackers
the proper techniques for running laterally.
DIAGUUI 83
The drill
is organized and run in the same manner as the continual sliding drill, except
the linebacker runs laterally, keeping his shoulders square, instead of sliding.
• Mirror Crossfield Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to train linebackers to
mirror a ball carrier by moving laterally at an appropriately relative distance.

DIAGIUUII84
71

The drill starts with a ball carrier (leader) who walks or sprints in a straight line,
changing from one speed to another.
He should stay at one speed for at least five
yards. When the leader gets to a marker (twenty-five to thirty yards away), he steps
forward to either side. The linebacker mirrors the leader by sliding or running laterally,
staying slightly behind him, and maintaining the same distance between them
(approximately two yards).
He stays lateral until the ball carrier turns up, and then
tackles him.
If done without pads, the drill
is ended with a "push-acceleration".
• Change of Direction Race Drills — The purpose of these drills
is to evaluate
and improve a linebacker's ability to quickly change direction.
DIAGRAM 8-S
Lateral race
- The linebackers stand facing the coach with their near foot on a
line.
On a hand signal from coach, they run laterally, keeping their shoulders
square to the coach until they touch or cross a line five yards five times (a total
distance of twenty-five yards). They then repeat the drill facing
in the opposite
direction.
Forward-backward race
- The linebackers stand with both feet behind the line
and shoulders parallel to the line.
On a signal from the coach, they sprint
forward five yards until they touch or cross the next line.
Then, they run
backwards to the starting line and repeat until they have gone five times (a
total of twenty-five yards).
Around-the-Bag
Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to develop a linebacker's
quickness and teach him to strain into pressure without becoming overextended
and to recover by making a second effort.
72

DIAGRAM 8Hi
A ball carrier (leader) stands at one end of a long bag that is lying on the ground,
while the linebacker stands at the other end and faces the leader
The leader comes
forward on one side of the bag and steps into the linebacker The defender reacts by
coming forward on that side of the bag and pushes the leader back a short distance,
maintaining his head high with his buttocks lowered to prevent over extension, his
back arched, and his feet accelerating with short, choppy steps.
Both men recover
and race to the other side of the bag and repeat the same procedure.
On the last
contact (usually the third), the defender strains and pushes the leader back beyond
the bag.
• Lateral Fill-Around-The-Bags
Drill — The purpose of this drill
is the same as
that of the "around the bag"
drill.
DIAGRAM 87
Four or more bags are placed on the ground so that they are parallel to each other
The drill
is executed
in the same manner as the around-the-bag drill except that after
each contact, both the ball carrier (leader) and the defender continue on to the next
alley. The defender pushes the leader back after they have gone around the last bag.
73

Diamond Mirror Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to develop the ability to
move backwards and laterally change directions on both the signal of a coach
and the action of an opponent.
DIA6iUW84
To begin the drill, the linebackers position themselves as diagrammed, facing the
coach.
The coach first signals the closest defender to run backwards in a straight
line, laterally at forty-five degree angles, or forward
in a straight line.
The other
three linebackers do what the first man does, trying to maintain the same distance
between each other. On the final signal, everyone sprints full speed to the coach.
• Score Drill (Mirror Dodge) — The purpose of this drill
is to develop quickness,
sliding ability, and the ability to react to an offensive player without becoming
overextended.
It also provides an excellent tool to evaluate the movement
ability of a defender.
DIA6UII84
74

The ball carrier (leader) stands about three to four yards from a line between two
long bags lying on the ground.
He attempts to cross the line between the two bags
as fast as possible by moving laterally and faking the defender who
is mirroring him.
As soon as he crosses the line, he returns to the starting position and tries to score
(by crossing the lines untouched) as many times as possible in a given time limit,
usually fifteen to twenty seconds. The defender slides to stay in front of the leader
trying to prevent him from scoring.
He may use his hands but the emphasis
is on
moving the feet and not being overextended.
To emphasize the importance of moving
the feet, the drill
is done occasionally with the defender putting his hands behind his
back.
Tackling Drills
• Form Tackling Drills (versus a player or a sled) — The purpose of form tackling
drills
is to teach the proper form
in making a tackle.
Fit
- the defender is fitted into the sled (or ball carrier) in the proper contact
position. The position that he should end up
in upon making contact with the
ball carrier.
Fit and follow through
- from the fitted position the defender drives through
the sled (or ball carrier) wrapping his arms, keeping his head up, and
accelerating his feet.
The tackle
- starting from a good hitting position about three yards away from
the sled (or ball carrier), the defender fires into the sled, makes the tackle, and
follows through as described.
• Score Tackling Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to force the linebacker to
move and change directions before making a tackle.
L
B
DUGRAM 810
7S

Three to five bags are positioned on the ground parallel to each other about two yards
apart. The ball carrier and defender align on opposite sides of the middle bag. The
ball carrier runs back and forth between the outside bags and tries to fake the
defender.
On the command "score", the ball carrier runs straight up the nearest alley.
When the command
is given, he tries to get across the front edge of the bags.
The
defender mirrors the ball carrier and attempts to tackle the ball carrier and drive him
back before he crosses the front edge of the bags.
• Attack-A-Bag Drill — Similar to the "score tackling drill," the purpose of this
drill
is to force the linebacker to move and change directions before making a
tackle.
DIAGRAM 8-11
Two bags are positioned about eight yards apart with a coach (player) standing
in the
middle of the bags. A defender is positioned 10-12 yards away from the bags. The
defender moves forward as fast as possible yet in a good position. When he reaches
a point approximately five yards from the bags, the coach steps to one side or the
other. The defender then angles toward that bag, drives his head across
in front,
turns into the bag, picks
it up, and takes
it back five yards. When practicing without
pads tackling
is simulated with a push-acceleration (the defender places both hands
under the leader's shoulders, with his head up, back arched, and feet moving
in short,
choppy steps).
Drills on Shedding Blockers
The purpose of these drills
is to practice and develop the techniques involved in
shedding blockers.
• Simulated Blow vs. Air Drill — Hit, accelerate feet, strain, get off the block.
(Straighten, angle, etc.)
• Slide-Butt Drill — Slide as
if reacting to a blocker then pop as
if striking a
blow.
Slide-Pop, Slide-Pop Drill — Do not cross over.
76

• Slide-Push-Give Drill — Simulate playing off a low block by sliding, pushing,
and giving (all
in one synchronized movement).
Use a sled,
if available.
Combination Drills
• Dive Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to have a linebacker learn to play off
various types of blocks and make a tackle.
DIAGRAM 8-12
Two bags are laid on the ground parallel to each other approximately five yards apart.
An offensive blocker
is positioned between the bags with a ball carrier about five
yards directly behind him. The linebacker aligns facing the blocker. The coach signals
for the blocker either to fire straight ahead or to execute a low block to one side.
If
the coach points straight ahead, the ball carrier goes to either side of the blocker but
stays inside the bag.
The offensive blocker then gets involved
in the drill.
The
linebacker plays off the block and makes a tackle.
• Two-man Dive Drill — The purpose of the drill
is the same as that of the dive
drill, with the exception that more people are involved.

DIAGRAM 813
77

The drill
is organized in the same way as the dive drill, except two bags are positioned
about three yards outside the other bags, and that there are two blockers and two
linebackers involved. The coach signals the type of blocks (same as in dive drill) and
the starting count. The coach calls the starting signals.
If the blockers go straight
ahead, the ball carrier runs forward and must stay within the inside bags.
If the
blockers position block to one side, the ball carrier goes between the two outside
bags in that direction. The linebackers play the blocks and make the tackle whichever
way the ball carrier chooses to run.
• Three-On-One Key Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to have the linebacker
react to a key, play off various types of blocks, and make a tackle.
DIAGRAM 8-14
Two bags are laid on the ground parallel to each other and about seven yards apart.
Three offensive blockers are positioned alongside each other, between the bags, and
in a three- or four-point stance. A ball carrier aligns himself approximately five yards
behind the middle blocker and the linebacker starts opposite the middle blocker
The
coach signals to one of the blockers and initiates the action with the command "go."
If he points to one of the outside blockers, they come at an angle and block the
linebacker above the waist. The ball carrier breaks
in that direction and stays inside
the bags.
The linebacker slides, plays the block, and makes the tackle.
If the coach
points to the middle blocker, he also gives him a direction.
On command, the blocker
tries to gain position on that side and blocks below the waist.
The bail carrier goes
to that side and runs between the bag and the outside blocker. The linebacker plays
the block and makes the tackle.
• Inside Linebacker Key Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to force an inside
linebacker to play off blocks and make a tackle after moving laterally.
78

DIAGUUI 8 IS
Three bags are laid on the ground parallel to each other, about three yards apart. A
blocker is positioned
in each of the two alleys in a three- or four-point stance. A ball
carrier is positioned about three yards on the opposite side of the middle bag. The
coach signals to one side and initiates the action with the command "go."
On the
command, the ball carrier starts to the signaled side and the blocker comes forward
and high blocks the linebacker. The ball carrier breaks anywhere between the two
bags. The linebacker slides in the direction of the ball carrier, plays the block, and
makes the tackle.
• Deiiver-A-Blow Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to develop "shock" when
delivering a blow, to react to blockers at different angles, and to come off
blocks properly.
DIAGRAM 8-1
B
Three offensive blockers are aligned alongside each other with a distance of about
one and one-half yards between each man. A ball carrier
is positioned about five
yards behind the middle blocker, and the linebacker aligns across from the middle
blocker and faces him. The coach points to one of the blockers and the designated
man blocks the linebacker above the waist.
The linebacker reacts to square up on
the blocker and delivers a blow.
After contact, both players recover to the starting
positions as quickly as possible.
The coach then points to another blocker and the
79

drill continues.
To conclude the drill, the coach raises his hand to one side.
On this
signal, the ball carrier goes
in that direction, while the blocker on that side fires out.
The linebacker plays the block and then makes the tackle.
Pass Defense Drills
• Catching Drills — The primary purpose of these drills
is to develop and improve
a linebacker's ability to catch the football.
One-hand-catch — The coach and linebacker face each other at varying
distances (seven to twelve yards).
The ball
is thrown to a point above the
linebacker's head, where he must catch
it with one hand.
Two-hand-catch — The coach and linebacker face each other at a distance
between seven and twenty yards.
The ball
is thrown to the linebacker so that
he must catch
it with his hands in various positions.
Step-forward catch — The ball
is thrown to the linebacker in the same manner
as the two-hand catch, but the linebacker now comes one or two steps forward
to catch the ball at the highest possible point.
Look — The linebacker stands with his back to the coach at a distance of about
ten yards.
On the command, "look," the linebacker turns completely around to
face the coach, and the ball
is thrown.
The linebacker steps forward to catch
the ball at the highest possible point.
Concentration — Two players are positioned
in front of a linebacker.
All of the
players face the coach at a distance of approximately ten yards.
As the ball
is thrown, the two players wave their hands in front of the linebacker but do
not touch the ball. The linebacker concentrates and catches the ball.
Angle interception — Some type of object is placed on the ground at a distance
of about seven yards from the linebackers and ten yards from the coach. The
linebackers are positioned beyond the object so that they must come forw/ard
at various angles to catch the ball.
On the signal the linebacker runs towards
the marker, the ball
is thrown, and the catch
is made in front of the marker.

DIAGRAM 8 17
Semi-Circle Peripheral Vision Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to emphasize
quick hands, concentration, peripheral vision, and to have fun.
DIAGRAM 818
The other players form a semi-circle around a designated linebacker. The designated
player and the first man
in the semi-circle both have footballs.
As soon as the
designated player passes the ball to the second man, the first player passes the ball
to him.
This pattern continues around the semi-circle and back to the beginning.
• Match-Up, Zone Drills (A receiver has threatened a linebacker's zone from the
outside). ball from a terminal position which the linebacker would have
if his
zone had been threatened.

DIAGBAM8-I9
The linebacker looks at the coach and assumes a position with his feet at
approximately a 45° angle to the coach. The distance between them
is approximately
ten yards.
On the coach's "look", the linebacker breaks to intercept the ball (pivots
back to face the ball or just breaks), shouts "fire," and sprints toward the coach for a
distance of five yards.
• Terminal Mirror Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the linebacker
his proper position
in relation to a receiver in his zone and to have him
anticipate making an interception.
3 yards

DIAGRAM 8 21
The procedure
is the same as for the terminal mirror drill, except that the linebacker
aligns himself seven yards from the coach and runs laterally back to the terminal
position.
• Lateral Retreat-To-The-Pattern Drill — The purpose of this drill
is for the
linebacker to develop the ability to retreat to an area, read the offensive
pattern and the ball, and make an interception.

The coach and linebacker line up as they did
in the lateral retreat mirror drill and a
receiver is positioned about eight to ten yards outside the linebacker
On command,
the receiver runs straight down the field about twelve to fifteen yards and breaks
in
or out. The coach throws the ball on the receiver's break. The linebacker retreats to
his terminal position, makes the interception, shouts "fire," and sprints five yards
forward at full speed.
• True Zone Drills (a receiver is not threatening the linebacker's zone).
Terminal back pedal — The purpose of this drill
is to learn to back pedal
properly and break on the ball at a proper angle to make the interception.
DIAGRAM 8-23
Two bags are positioned upright approximately fourteen yards apart and twenty yards
from the coach. A linebacker lines up three yards
in front of the bags, midway
between the two bags, and facing the coach. On a signal the linebacker back pedals
until the coach looks at one of the bags. When the coach looks, the linebacker turns
his shoulders and sprints at an angle to make the interception
in front of the bag.
After the ball
is caught, the linebacker shouts "fire" and sprints forward for five yards.
• Lateral Retreat and Back Pedal Drill — The purpose of this drill
is the same as
the terminal back pedal
drill, except the linebacker must now retreat to his
zone.
84

DIAGRAM 8-24
The bags are positioned in the same places as in the terminal back pedal drill. The
coach aligns in front of one of the bags at a distance of twenty yards, while the
linebacker
is seven yards in front of the coach.
On a signal the linebacker runs
laterally to the terminal spot (twelve yards deep and midway between the bags) and
from that point everything
is the same as the terminal back pedal.
• Two-Man Tip Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to ensure that the linebacker
continues to pursue the ball until
it hits the ground.
DIAGRAM 8 2S
8S

Two bags are positioned upright and eighteen yards apart. The coach stands midway
between the bags and about twenty yards away from them. Two linebackers line up
alongside each other, and face the coach—approximately seven yards from him. On
a signal, each linebacker retreats to the bag on his side. The ball
is then thrown to
one of the linebackers when he reaches the bag, and he tips the ball into the air. The
other linebacker sprints to the ball and catches
it at the highest possible point.
Both
linebackers then sprint full speed to the coach.
• One-On-One Coverage Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to cover a receiver
man-for-man, both cautiously and aggressively.
The linebacker covers a receiver all over the field using either cautious or aggressive
man-for-man techniques.
Fumble Recovery
• Form Recovery Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the proper method of
falling on a loose football.
A ball
is placed three to four yards in front of a linebacker. On command, the linebacker
dives forward and reaches out to the ball.
On contact, the linebacker pulls the ball to
his stomach and curls around the ball, lying on his side to protect himself.
• Competitive Recovery Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the
linebackers to fight for a loose ball.
Two linebackers line up alongside each other.
On command, the linebackers fall
forward, touch their chests to the ground, and scramble after a ball that has been
thrown between them.
86

Drills— Group and Team
Football
is a team game, requiring individuals to practice
in groups or as a team.
In
order to be successful, players must learn to function as a cohesive unit, working
together and anticipating each other's reactions.
Group and team drills are designed
to create game-like situations that enable individuals to develop proficiency at
selected skills and techniques, while fostering group cohesion.
The preparation for all of the group and team drills begins off the field.
Coaches
should coordinate their efforts.
If several coaches are involved in a drill, they should
identify the objectives they want to achieve and what role each individual coach must
undertake
if the drill
is to be conducted properly. The coaches should also make sure
that they are not duplicating something that has already been covered
in another drill
or activity.
If a scout team
is running plays from cards, every play should be drawn exactly the
way
it is anticipated the opponents will run the play. The opponent's plays that must
be stopped should be run against all the defensive schemes—especially the defenses
which are most vulnerable to those plays. The plays should be listed
in sequence
with the hash mark, formation, and the down and distance of each play recorded.
The person responsible for running the plays should have all this information.
During group and team drills,
it is also important to emphasize basic fundamentals
such as stance and proper techniques.
Quickness, hustle, second effort, getting off
the ground, and going after loose balls should also be emphasized. The necessary to
develop good habits should be emphasized at all times.
For instance, even
if the ball
carriers are not to be taken to the ground,
it
is
still important for the linebacker to
accelerate his feet and take the ball carrier back.
Everyone should get to the ball by
taking the proper lane of pursuit.
During pass drills, a coach should check to see
if a receiver could have been knocked
to the ground, whether everyone
is going to the football, and
if the defensive team
turns to offense once an interception has been made.
Aggressiveness (trying to make
a big play) should be emphasized
in all drills.
Every drill should have a primary
purpose (defend outside runs, etc.).
"Surprise" plays (a deep pass, etc.) should be run
occasionally to keep the defense alert.
Group Pass Defense Drills
In our defensive scheme, five underneath zones are defined.
If the ball
is in the
middle of the field, the flats are seven yards from the sideline and twelve yards deep.
87

The middle zone
is
in the middle of the field and
is fifteen yards deep. The curls are
one yard inside the hash (toward the middle) and are twelve to fifteen yards deep.
For every two yards that the ball moves, the zone moves one yard
in the same
direction.
The flat zone, however,
is never closer than four yards to the sideline or
farther than nine yards from the sideline. The curls are never farther than three yards
on either side of the hash mark. The middle zone
is never closer than five yards to
either hash mark.
Linebackers should be reminded that the farther they have to go
to their pass zone, the more concerned they should be with width and less concerned
with depth.
Various drills have been devised to develop the necessary skills to play
good pass defense.
• Zone Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to define the five underneath pass
zones in relation to the ball and the field and have the linebackers retreat to
those areas.

Holding a ball, the coach stands inside the ten-yard line at different positions on the
field. When everyone
is ready, the coach drops straight back or sprints to either side,
while the linebackers retreat to their proper zones.
On the coach's signal, they stop.
Each linebacker's position
is checked; then the ball
is moved to another spot on the

• Goal-Line Pass Skeleton — The purpose of this drill
is to defend against
anticipated goal-line passes and to give the linebackers a feel for playing
pass defense inside the ten-yard line.

Offensive backs and receivers run patterns against those linebackers involved in goal-
line pass coverage. The plays are run from the ten-yard line to the goal-line, in
sequence, off cards, and against pre-determined defenses.

Goal-Line Corner Run Support Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the
proper run support techniques against outside runs
in a goal-line situation.
o

Pursuit
• Skeleton Pursuit Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the linebackers
the proper angles of pursuit and of convergence on the ball.
The coach or quarterback, two running backs, and two wide receivers run three plays
at the linebackers.
Each play is first walked through, including the defensive pursuit
lanes, then
is run at full speed. The first play
is a simple down-the-line option where
the quarterback comes along the line of scrimmage and pitches the ball to the nearer
back.
The ball carrier runs for the sideline, then turns toward the goal-line.
All
linebackers must take the proper lane of pursuit and touch the ball carrier.
Next, the
quarterback drops back and throws a flare pass to one of the backs.
The ball carrier
heads for the goal-line, and the linebackers converge and touch him.
Finally, the
quarterback throws the ball out to one of the wide receivers, and the linebackers
pursue and touch the runner.
DIAGRAM 9-10
Special Problems
If an opponent's offense presents a special dilemma to the defense, a drill can be
organized to emphasize some of their best plays.
It might be an option period, an
inside running period, a period for screens and delays, or other types of passes, etc.
Teamwork
• Thud
Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to present game situations to the
linebackers and condition them to the tempo of the game.
93

This practice period involves an entire offensive and defensive team. The plays are
run off cards,
in sequence, from different positions on the field, and against pre-
determined defenses. The down and distance
is called out for every play, and the
ball
is moved down the field.
The plays are run quickly, and everyone must hustle
in
and out of the huddle.
The blocking
is full speed, but the ball carrier is not taken to
the ground.
Special situations such as "get the ball back" defense and "two minutes
to go" defense are practiced during this period.
One sequence usually comprises ten
to fourteen plays.
94
