How to Condition Your Players: Ht to Win
In order for a linebacker to reach his full athletic potential, he must become as
physically fit as his personal genetics will allow.
Dedicated participation
in a sound
conditioning program will ensure that an individual reaches his "physical fitness"
potential, and,
in turn, help him to reach his true potential as a linebacker. A
comprehensive conditioning program for linebackers should include activities aimed
at improving:
• Muscular power
• Running speed
• Anaerobic capacity
• Aerobic capacity
• Agility
• Quickness
Muscular Power
Football, particularly the position of linebacker, requires the demonstration of
muscular power (frequently referred to as explosive strength or explosiveness).
Unfortunately, many coaches do not understand what muscular power really
is.
Power is the rate at which work
is performed,
it
is not just speed of movement nor
is
it simply muscular strength.
It can be represented by the equation:
Power = (Force X Distance)/Time
From this equation,
it
is quite evident that power is dependent upon the interaction
of three factors:
strength (force), speed (time) and flexibility (distance).
Muscular
power can be enhanced by improving any one of the three factors without adversely
affecting the other two.
Factors Contributing to Power
Strength (Force). Strength
is simply the ability to exert muscular force.
It is primarily
determined by the ability of each muscle fiber to generate force and the ability of
the nerves to stimulate a large number o muscle fibers.
Proper strength training
develops individual muscle fibers and enables the body to recruit an increased
number of fibers at any given time.
Strength training for power does not mean fast or explosive training. The speed at
which an individual executes his strength exercises has
little or no beneficial effect
on speed of movement or strength development.
Additionally, explosive training
125

significantly increases the amount of stress placed on the connective tissues, thereby
increasing the individual's injury potential.
High intensity (high-tension) training is
proper strength training (i.e., training with relatively heavy weightloads in a controlled
manner).
In order to develop maximum strength, an athlete should:
(1
) lift and lower resistances
in a controlled manner to ensure that the exercising muscle—not momentum— is
responsible for executing the movement; (2) exercise the muscle through
its full range
of motion to ensure that flexibility is maintained and that the muscle strengthened at
all joint angles; (3) include exercises for all the major muscle groups of the body; this
will increase overall body strength and will help to prevent injuries by maintaining
muscle balance; and (4) progressively increase resistances as muscular adaptation
occurs overtime.
Speed (Time). The time required for force application
is most closely related to speed
of movement.
Speed of movement is a very complex factor that requires precise
coordination between the nervous and muscular systems.
It is highly dependent upon
the development of efficient motor neuron pathways.
Therefore, speed of movement
can be enhanced by improving coordination, efficiency of movement, and timing.
It
requires endless hours of repetitive, skill-specific training to improve one's
coordination, efficiency of movement and timing.
Skill-specific training
is critical for
increasing speed and subsequently power.
Movement speed for a particular athletic event depends primarily on inherited
neuromuscular factors, and secondarily on quality skill practice.
Athletes should
practice their skills through the particular activity's range of motion, concentrating
on the optimal sequence of events to fine tune their coordination and timing.
For
best results, skills should be practiced exactly as they will be performed
in
competition.
Flexibility (Distance). The distance component of the power equation can be limited
by an individual's functional range of motion.
For example, the velocity at which
athletes throw different objects (baseballs, footballs, javelins, etc.) can be severely
limited by poor shoulder girdle flexibility.
Joint range of motion can be improved
through proper strength and flexibility training.
A static stretching (i.e., slowly stretching a muscle past its normal length and holding
the stretch) program can be used to improve joint flexibility.
The intensity of the
exercises for the slow, static stretching should be just below the pain threshold of
the individual. A sound program will include exercises for each of the major muscle
groups of the body.
In the initial stages of a static stretching program, the stretched position should be
held for approximately 10-15 seconds. As flexibility improves, the stretched position
can be held for up to a maximum of 60 seconds for each repetition.
The total length
126

of time for the workout will be roughly 10 minutes, depending on the number of
exercises performed.
Proper stretching can significantly improve an individual's joint
flexibility.
Improved joint flexibility can increase power by enabling an athlete to
apply force over a greater distance and usually with more ease and fluidity.
Running Speed
Running speed
is primarily a function of stride frequency and stride length.
Stride
frequency can be defined as the number of steps you take when running for a given
length of time or distance.
It
is a direct reflection of the speed with which you are
able to move your limbs. The ability to move the limbs at an increased velocity relies
on two factors:
fiber type composition of the muscles providing the limb movement,
and the neurological efficiency of the involved muscle groups (i.e., the nervous
system's ability to transmit impulses from the brain to the receptors
in the contracting
muscles).
Not much can be done to dramatically alter a player's genetic components;
however, through proper training, functional capabilities can be enhanced.
Stride
length
is the distance you can cover with each stride.
Stride length requires functional
strength (i.e., ability to apply force through the range of motion) of the extensor
muscles of the hips, knees, and ankles.
The individual should also possess sufficient
flexibility in the joints involved to allow a greater range of motion and fluidity. An
effective program to develop sprinting speed should include work in three distinct
areas:
strength training, flexibility training, and quality sprint training.
Speed
is
basically a result of the rapid application of force by muscular contractions and
is an
important component of muscular power.
Strength Training.
In order to maintain balance between muscle groups, a properly
designed strength training program should include exercises for all the major muscular
structures of the body.
To develop leg strength for sprinting,
all muscle groups of the
lower body should be trained, including the gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, hip
flexors, adductors/abductors, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles. A limited number
of sets should be performed with rep ranges varying according to the desired result.
The relationship between muscular strength and muscular endurance can be
expressed by using the concept of the repetition continuum.
Using rep ranges toward
the lower end of the continuum (6-8 reps) emphasizes muscular strength, while the
rep ranges greater than 10-12, enhance muscular endurance to a greater degree.
To
develop muscular strength for sprinting, the number of repetitions should be kept
toward the lower end of the continuum, in the range of 6-10.
It is important to keep
in mind, however, that the lower the rep range used, the heavier the resistance loads,
and consequently, the greater potential of injury.
Throughout the training year, the
repetition ranges utilized may change to increase muscular strength and muscular
endurance while also introducing variety into the program.
Each repetition should be
performed at a controlled speed of movement for all exercises. As the muscles which
provide leg drive become stronger, their ability to overcome inertia and accelerate
the body mass increases, thus enhancing the athlete's potential for speed.

Flexibility Training. A proper strength training program will increase the muscles'
ability to exert force. As stated before, however, this functional strength must be
exerted through an appropriate range of motion.
Flexibility training should include
static stretching of the muscle groups of the lower body, as well as running drills to
increase dynamic flexibility and facilitate a relaxed running style.
Static stretching
should be performed both before (following a warm-up) and especially after the
running workout.
There are a number of form running drills that may be included in
the program.
Drills we have utilized at Penn State include high knees, heel kicks,
power skips, and arm action drills.
Quality Sprinting. The ability to sprint
is an athletic event in itself and requires
precise coordination of agonists/antagonists via specific motor pathways.
The
principle of specificity states that
in order to "fine tune" the motor pathways required
to perform a given skill, an individual should practice the skill exactly as
it will be
performed
in competition.
In other words, by increasing the coordination of the
muscle groups involved in sprinting, speed of movement of these body segments will
increase. An athlete can spend time performing various running drills to increase
dynamic flexibility and to enhance proper technique, but to provide an effective
training stimulus, the program must ultimately include maximal speed sprints.
Generally, the length of the sprints
is determined by the requirements of the particular
event.
For the sport of football, distances ranging from 10 yards up to 50-60 yards
are appropriate.
Initially, a limited number of repetitions (generally between 4 and
10) should be performed. As conditioning levels improve, a greater number of sprints
may be completed.
The key ingredient
is the quality of work.
All quality sprints
should be run full speed (95-100% effort) with complete recovery allowed between
repetitions.
If the recovery time between sprints
is not sufficient, sprint times will
increase and hence the intensity of training declines. When the heart returns to 130
beats per minute, the athlete
is probably approaching nearing adequate recovery.
This
is not an absolute reality.
Individuals will respond differently, depending upon
their level of training.
The bottom line
is that an athlete should feel almost fully
recovered before sprinting again.
Anaerobic Capacity
Anaerobic conditioning (sometimes referred to as "sprint conditioning")
is necessary
to increase an individual's ability to perform repeated maximal bursts of activity
interspersed with periods of rest. The goal of the anaerobic conditioning portion of
the workout is to overload the anaerobic system to increase the ability of the body to
supply energy (ATP) to the muscles
in the absence of oxygen.
During anaerobic
conditioning, the intensity of effort will be high, but because of the increased amount
of exercise and shorter rest intervals, the absolute speed of the repetitions may not
be as high as in "speed" sprinting. The goal
is to place an effective metabolic demand
on the athlete rather than worrying about maximal speed repeats.
In order to train
the anaerobic system, exercise intervals should be kept below two minutes because
aerobic energy stores are increasingly called upon as exercise intervals increase in
duration.
If the exercise intervals used are 30 seconds or longer, the rest intervals
128

on the athlete rather than worrying about maximal speed repeats.
In order to train
the anaerobic system, exercise intervals should be kept below two minutes because
aerobic energy stores are increasingly called upon as exercise intervals increase in
duration.
If the exercise intervals used are 30 seconds or longer, the rest intervals
should be initially set at three to four times as long. As conditioning improves, this
exercise/rest ratio may decrease to 1-to-1
or even 1-to- 1/2,
in order to provide
progressive overload.
If the sprint distances chosen are 20 seconds or less, recovery
periods should be limited to 10-15 seconds. The sprint distances chosen will depend
on the demands of the sport or position.
Keep
in mind that
it is difficult to "condition"
the athlete with very short sprints.
Sprints shorter than 20 yards should be used for
agilities and other position-specific drills.
For sprint conditioning purposes, distances
at least 20 yards or greater are most effective.
The total number of repetitions
performed in the sprint conditioning period will depend on the length of the exercise
interval (sprint distance).
Increasing the amount of exercise
is another method to
provide progressive overload. Remember that the total volume (amount) of exercise
will be greater than that performed during the quality sprint portion of the workout.
As the number of repetitions increases, they can be segmented
in order to allow an
extended rest period (2-10 minutes) between sets.
Aerobic Capacity
Aerobic capacity refers to the ability of an individual to use oxygen during prolonged
and strenuous exercise. An athlete's ability to recover from all-out, intermittent
bursts of activity is highly related to his aerobic capacity.
All factors considered, a
football player with a high aerobic capacity will be able to perform longer, with less
fatigue, and at a higher level of functioning than one with a low aerobic capacity.
A football player can significantly improve his aerobic capacity by adhering to the
following basic guidelines:
• Engage in continuous, dynamic activities that involve the large muscles of the
body (e.g., running, cycling, stair climbing, etc.)
• Exercise at a level of intensity that
is equivalent to 70-85% of maximum
capacity (i.e., a training of between 150-175 beats per minute for most high
school-age and college-age football players).
• Sustain the aerobic activity for a duration of at least 20 minutes but not more
than 60 minutes.
• Perform the aerobic activity three to five times per week.
Agility
Agility, like speed,
is largely influenced by the precise coordination that occurs
between the muscular and nervous systems.
In order for an athlete to experience
optimal improvement in agility, the agility drills performed during training should
mimic skills the athlete must perform in competition (drills involving agility can been
found in Chapters 8 and
9).
The remark of the old football coach upon watching
129

players perform the traditional tire drill during practice illustrates a proper view of
agility drills: "We don't have tires on the football fields for games in our conference."
Quickness
Response time
is the time required for an individual to initiate a response to a specific
stimulus and to move part of his body from one point to another.
Coaches often refer
to this motor skill as "quickness".
Obviously, this
is a highly valuable trait for football
players.
Like agility, the most effective methods for improving an athlete's quickness
are general conditioning and specificity training.
To enhance quickness, an athlete
should adhere to the following general principles:
• Place a demand on all involved systems.
• Regular practice of all specific skills
• Engage in a sound strength training program.
