How to Keep Your Players' Minds in the Game
While
it is important to practice well, a team must also perform well. Many players
respond differently in a game situation; some rise to the occasion, while others seem
to become too nervous to function
effectively.
Still others enjoy the thrill of a crowd
and play much better than expected.
Most great players have uncanny timing and
natural instincts for the "big play."
Because
it appears that the majority of these
characteristics are primarily innate, the coach has little or no control over them.
It
is important, however, that coaches and players talk as much as possible about
each game situation and the
little things that might make the difference between
success and failure.
First,
it is necessary that the players be able to recognize the
most common plays that will be run by their opponent and understand the blocking
schemes that go with those plays.
Next
, the players should be able to recognize
offensive formations and backfield sets and know the characteristics of each.
Finally,
the players should be aware of down and distance situations, offensive strategy, big
plays, field position, and critical situations.
The Opponent's Basic Plays
As a general rule, each of your opponents will exhibit certain offensive tendencies.
Accordingly, each of these teams has specific plays that
it tends to run
in particular
situations.
These plays should be identified and defined so that everyone has a
thorough understanding of these plays. A few of the offensive plays which are
relatively popular (and commonly used) in high school and college football are
illustrated in diagrams 10-1
to 10-6.
Most great players have uncanny timing
and natural instincts for the "big play.

Understanding Offensive Formations
Linebackers should be alert to a team's offensive tendencies. Most teams will run
only certain plays from a particular formation.
Because each formation creates a
unique problem, a linebacker should be able to adjust more quickly and anticipate
better
if he can recognize the formation and its basic characteristics. The linebacker
should anticipate but not guess.
Inside linebackers should always call out the strength of the formation and the type
of backfield set, for example, "Flanker left, 1° backs".
Examples of several of the most
common backfield sets and their characteristics include the following:
• 1" backs
DUfiRiW 1fr7
Features:
-
Basically, this formation facilitates a tailback-oriented offense.
It enables the
tailback to hit quickly in a lot of different holes.
-
It facilitates a strong outside running game to either side (options, sweeps,
etc.).
- Most teams use play action passes or challenge the perimeter with the run-
pass option.
- Other basic plays include the sprint draw, isolation, off tackle, buck, veer,
veer option, and passes off those plays.
102

• -T" backs — the halfback is set away from the strength of the formation.
DIAGRAM IM
^^^^strongest running play is the "belly" to the side of the "set" halfback.
- The set halfback (number two) is more of a pass threat.
(Flare control and
weak-side flood game).
- Most of the running game to the flanker-side
is off counter action.

DIAGRAM IM
"ThTprimary purpose of this set is to be able to flood the flanker-side zones
(get three receivers out), usually off sprint action or semi-sprmt action passes.
- The strongest running plays are the sweep and belly to the flanker- side.
103

•
Full house "T" or solid backfleld.
DIAGRAM 10-10
Features:
-
This formation facilitates a power running set, usually revolving around the
fullback.
-
Basic plays off this formation include the belly, the belly option, and the belly
pass.
-
This formation
is very balanced because of the lead back to both sides.
-
Counters are easily run because of the closeness of all the backs.
• Pow/er
"I".

This formation offers another power running set.
-
This formation
is very similar to the
"I" with a stronger off tackle game
(isolation and belly) to the power side and better counter game away from
the strength of the formation.
- The isolation and the blast option are the basic plays away from the strength
of the formation.
104

• "Wishbone."
DIAGRAM 10^12
Features:
-
This formation is very similar to the fullhouse "T° except that everything is
quicker.
The backs are in better position to run the option and to get to
either side quickly.
- The passing game comes off play action.
• "Tight" split backs.
DIAGRAM 1IM3
Features:
-
This formation
is designed to facilitate another quick-hitting offense.
- The basic running plays are the veers, (inside and outside) veer option,
counters, counter options, and lead draw.
- The passing game
is usually play action (pop pass, boots, etc.)

Features:
-
This formation primarily offers passing set (five-man out patterns and floods).
- The basic running plays are the pro sweep, quick pitch, trap, and off
tackle.
-
Play action passes are usually the boot and sweep pass.
Examples of several of the various offensive formations and their characteristics
include the following:
• Pro-flanker left.
DIAGRAM 10^15
Features:
- The strongest running plays are usually to the flanker side.
-

("trips") side.
- As a running formation,
it is usually limited to a sweep or trap.
Game Situations
Linebackers should be aware of many different situations which arise during a game.
They should be alert and flexible, and able to rapidly adjust their play. While each
team has its own personality, several general guidelines exist which linebackers
should adhere to during a game:
• Anticipate run or pass and adjust your alignment in the obvious situation.
• Anticipate, but do not guess; big defensive plays come about by recognition
and going full speed on every play.
• Do not let your opponent out of the defense's four-down area (i.e., keep them
inside their thirty-five yard line).
• Come up with a "big play" between the thirty-five yard lines.
Try not to let
them get into their four-down area with ease.
• Realize that once your opponent crosses your thirty-five yard line, he is in four-
down territory.
Most teams will use their most consistent plays and stay patient; the closer
that they get to the goal-line, the tougher
it gets to make yardage.
Near the
goal-line, the defense has less area to defend against the pass and as a result
can, play more aggressively against the run.
• Know the score and the amount of time remaining.
110

Many games are won or lost in the last two minutes. The following factors are
important to remember when trying to prevent a score:
• Be aware of what
it will take for the opponent to win (a touchdown or a field
goal).
• The outside linebackers should go out on the wide receivers
if they are playing
the flat zone.
Inside linebackers should deepen.
• The outside linebackers should think of covering square outs and quick outs.
• Everyone should attempt to keep the ball carrier in the field of play.
• Stay alert for a quick line-up. Some opponents will align quickly after a first
down. A few might even run two or three plays without huddling.
• Realize that the clock
is stopped after a first down until the chains have been
moved.
• Don't panic!
Equally important, don't give the appearance of losing your
composure.
The opposite situation arises when the defense must get the ball back in order to
win.
In this situation the defensive players should:
• Try to make a "big play."
Don't panic, however, and start playing a "helter-
skelter" type defense.
• Keep their poise and stay together.
• Get off pile ups quickly and move into/out of the huddle rapidly.
• Know how many time-outs that their team has left and be ready to utilize them
wisely. The offense can stop the clock without calling "time-out."
• Realize that the clock stops in certain situations (e.g., when a pass
is
incomplete, the ball carrier goes out of bounds, or the ball changes hands). A
defensive team must not "waste" a "time-out" (i.e., call) in these situations.

How to Prepare for the Moment of Truth— Game Week
For most teams, preparation for a Friday or Saturday game begins the day after the
preceding game.
All team situations are different however.
Various coaching staffs
have their own methods of preparations.
Certain items, however,
should not be
overlooked. The basic day-to-day responsibilities of the linebacker coach during the
week of the game are outlined as follows:
Sunday
• The scout's report is reviewed to get a general idea about the upcoming
opponent.
• All available game films are evaluated.
• A list of the opponent's strengths
is developed.
• Charts of the opponent's running plays with the exact blocking schemes are
prepared.
• Charts of the underneath pass plays with the exact breaking points of the
primary receivers are drawn.
• Notes are made of any special problems, things to emphasize, and adjustments
that might be considered.
• The films of Saturday's game are reviewed.
• The linebackers are shown one or two reels of film of their upcoming opponent.
• Several of the pass and running plays frequently used by the upcoming opponent
are drawn up for the practice periods on Monday.
Monday
• A discussion of general practice organization involving the linebackers
is held.
• The general defensive scheme
is reviewed and discussed.
• Any problems with the defenses are analyzed and opened for discussion.
• The practice sessions are organized (i.e., draw up plays, organize drills, etc.)
• A meeting with the linebackers
is held prior to practice to present the defenses.
• Practice.
• The assignments for each defense are written up on Monday night (refer to
Example
1
at end of this chapter). As the coach writes, he should check for
any problems and be contemplating the appropriate adjustments which will be
required. The assignments are written to eliminate lengthy meetings and to
ensure that the linebackers know their precise assignments.
Tuesday
• The general practice organization involving the linebackers
is discussed.
• The defensive game plan
is discussed and finalized.
113

• The writing up of assignments
is completed.
• Preparations are made for practice.
• A meeting is held before practice during which the assignment sheets are
distributed.
• Practice.
• The coach meets with the linebackers
in the evening for a thorough review of
the opponent.
At this meeting the coach should: Analyze the opponent's
offense. Talk about the expected plays and offensive attack. Call out a defense
and point out the reaction that the linebacker should make to a certain play
when
in that defense.
• Point out any tips that might be helpful to the linebackers.
Wednesday
• Organize for practice.
• Discuss all of the problems that have to come to light on the practice field.
• Meet with the linebackers before practice to review or add any adjustments.
• Practice.
• Draw up the opponent's key plays.
(Refer to Examples 2a and 2b.)
Thursday
• Organize for practice.
• Tie any remaining loose ends together.
• Make a concerted effort to instill confidence at practice.
Friday
• Special notes (things to remember) are prepared for the linebackers. (Refer to
Example 3).
• A list is made of the defenses which will be used
in the game to include the
strengths of each defense and the reasons for using them.
(Refer to Example
4).
• A down and distance chart is prepared for the game.
This chart includes all of
the defenses and a place to record on which down the defenses are used
during the game.
(Refer to Example 5).
• Each linebacker should pre-play the game mentally to think of how he will
react to some of the problems which might arise during the game.
• A thorough review session
is held with the linebackers.

How to Deal With the Moment of Truth— Game Day
The basic alignment in the Penn State multiple defensive scheme
is the Split 6.
The
numerous variations of the Split 6 Defense and the role that linebackers play in these
defenses are outlined as follows:Game day
is the players' day. A coach's duties on
game day will vary from one staff to another.
However, some common responsibilities
pertaining to the linebackers exist.
Essentially, the linebacker coach should make
himself available should any problems arise.
He should answer all questions that the
players might have.
Occasionally, he may remind them of some specific points to
remember but will do so without causing any confusion or uncertainty (remember:
do not "overcoach").
Every coach approaches each game slightly differently.
In
general, however,
all coaches should make certain that their players are alert without
being tense. The basic objective
is to make each player feel as though he
is well-
prepared and ready to make an all-out effort, regardless of who his opponent might
be.
One of the responsibilities of the linebacker coach
is to "warm up" the linebackers.
It is important that the players begin to "sweat" and prepare themselves both
physically and mentally for the upcoming contest.
In most situations, the various phases
of the warm-up period for linebackers involve the following steps:
• Stretch as a team.
• Eive or six minutes of pass defense drill:
- terminal back pedal.
-
lateral start.
- angle interception.
• r\/lovement drills:
-
lateral start.
- continual sliding.
-
lateral run.
• Work with a partner:
- low blocks.
- bounce the shoulders.
- form tackles.
• Deliver the blow drill.
• Fumble recovery drill.
Once the game begins, the linebacker coach must try to remember to:
• Remain as focused, yet as objective, as possible.
• Work with and utilize the other assistant coaches.
• Know the defenses and the situations in which they are being used.
121

Evaluate the defense, particularly the play of the linebackers.
Record any mistakes or problems (recognize the opponent's plays that are
hurting the team).
Discuss these mistakes or problems with the linebackers when they come off
the field.
Confer with the other coaches
if problems have been identified which need
their input.
Review mistakes and problems during halftime, make the appropriate
adjustments, and review what is expected to happen
in the second half of the
game.
122

How to Evaluate Your Players' Performance
Following every game, the coach should evaluate the game films.
This review is
usually done on the Sunday immediately following a Saturday game.
The purpose of
this undertaking
is to evaluate techniques, coaching decisions, and personnel
in order
to make sure that the right people are being played
in the appropriate positions and
situations.
After reviewing the films, the coach should have identified each player's
mistakes, the steps which should be taken to correct these mistakes, and how each
player has contributed to the total effort.
It is important also that the players have
some knowledge of the results of the evaluations of their performance.
If a player
has performed well, a report of this fact can serve as an incentive and provide
motivation;
if a player has performed poorly, he should know what mistakes he made
so that he (together with his coach) can take steps
correct them.
An elaborate or complex performance grading system
is neither necessary nor
particularly worthwhile.
With so many variables in grading,
it
is very difficult to be
completely objective.
Certain intangibles, such as how one player complements
another, literally cannot be measured.
The grading system can be used to help make
personnel decisions but should not be the only factor An elaborate evaluation system
should not be used since
it would require a fair amount of time to grade, and thereby
possibly detracting from the time available to prepare for the next opponent.
In most
instances (at the collegiate level particularly),
it
is also not necessary to have signs,
gimmicks, or rewards — evaluation sheets given to the individual player are usually
sufficient.
The linebacker evaluation sheet should be designed so that each linebacker has the
results of his performance on one sheet of paper (refer to Figure 13-1).
Space should
be provided for:
• The total number of plays.
• The number of unassisted tackles made (i.e., the linebacker would have made
the tackle without assistance).
• The number of assisted tackles made (i.e., The linebacker contributed to the
tackle).
• The number of "great hits"
(i.e., a superior tackle).
• The number of "bonus plays:"
- causing a fumble.
- recovering a loose ball.
- making a tackle for a three or more yard loss.
123

- making an interception.
- deflecting a pass.
-
blocl<ing a kick.
- making a crucial play (i.e., a key tackle in a short yardage situation, a
touchdown saving tackle, etc.).
- making a tackle inside the opponent's twenty yard line on a kickoff.
- making a tackle on a punt for no gain.
- making a tackle for a safety.
The number of "loafs"
(i.e., anytime that the ball
is in play and the linebacker
is not going full speed).
The number of poor plays (i.e., violating a principle and not making the play,
missing a tackle, not using good judgment, etc.)
Comments:
- pertinent remarks about the linebacker's performance.
-
critical statements about incorrect play.
- suggestions for improvement and correction of mistakes.
- a good comment about a job well done (i.e., only exceptional performance or
effort).
- a general statement of the overall performance.
124

How to Condition Your Players: Ht to Win
In order for a linebacker to reach his full athletic potential, he must become as
physically fit as his personal genetics will allow.
Dedicated participation
in a sound
conditioning program will ensure that an individual reaches his "physical fitness"
potential, and,
in turn, help him to reach his true potential as a linebacker. A
comprehensive conditioning program for linebackers should include activities aimed
at improving:
• Muscular power
• Running speed
• Anaerobic capacity
• Aerobic capacity
• Agility
• Quickness
Muscular Power
Football, particularly the position of linebacker, requires the demonstration of
muscular power (frequently referred to as explosive strength or explosiveness).
Unfortunately, many coaches do not understand what muscular power really
is.
Power is the rate at which work
is performed,
it
is not just speed of movement nor
is
it simply muscular strength.
It can be represented by the equation:
Power = (Force X Distance)/Time
From this equation,
it
is quite evident that power is dependent upon the interaction
of three factors:
strength (force), speed (time) and flexibility (distance).
Muscular
power can be enhanced by improving any one of the three factors without adversely
affecting the other two.
Factors Contributing to Power
Strength (Force). Strength
is simply the ability to exert muscular force.
It is primarily
determined by the ability of each muscle fiber to generate force and the ability of
the nerves to stimulate a large number o muscle fibers.
Proper strength training
develops individual muscle fibers and enables the body to recruit an increased
number of fibers at any given time.
Strength training for power does not mean fast or explosive training. The speed at
which an individual executes his strength exercises has
little or no beneficial effect
on speed of movement or strength development.
Additionally, explosive training
125

significantly increases the amount of stress placed on the connective tissues, thereby
increasing the individual's injury potential.
High intensity (high-tension) training is
proper strength training (i.e., training with relatively heavy weightloads in a controlled
manner).
In order to develop maximum strength, an athlete should:
(1
) lift and lower resistances
in a controlled manner to ensure that the exercising muscle—not momentum— is
responsible for executing the movement; (2) exercise the muscle through
its full range
of motion to ensure that flexibility is maintained and that the muscle strengthened at
all joint angles; (3) include exercises for all the major muscle groups of the body; this
will increase overall body strength and will help to prevent injuries by maintaining
muscle balance; and (4) progressively increase resistances as muscular adaptation
occurs overtime.
Speed (Time). The time required for force application
is most closely related to speed
of movement.
Speed of movement is a very complex factor that requires precise
coordination between the nervous and muscular systems.
It is highly dependent upon
the development of efficient motor neuron pathways.
Therefore, speed of movement
can be enhanced by improving coordination, efficiency of movement, and timing.
It
requires endless hours of repetitive, skill-specific training to improve one's
coordination, efficiency of movement and timing.
Skill-specific training
is critical for
increasing speed and subsequently power.
Movement speed for a particular athletic event depends primarily on inherited
neuromuscular factors, and secondarily on quality skill practice.
Athletes should
practice their skills through the particular activity's range of motion, concentrating
on the optimal sequence of events to fine tune their coordination and timing.
For
best results, skills should be practiced exactly as they will be performed
in
competition.
Flexibility (Distance). The distance component of the power equation can be limited
by an individual's functional range of motion.
For example, the velocity at which
athletes throw different objects (baseballs, footballs, javelins, etc.) can be severely
limited by poor shoulder girdle flexibility.
Joint range of motion can be improved
through proper strength and flexibility training.
A static stretching (i.e., slowly stretching a muscle past its normal length and holding
the stretch) program can be used to improve joint flexibility.
The intensity of the
exercises for the slow, static stretching should be just below the pain threshold of
the individual. A sound program will include exercises for each of the major muscle
groups of the body.
In the initial stages of a static stretching program, the stretched position should be
held for approximately 10-15 seconds. As flexibility improves, the stretched position
can be held for up to a maximum of 60 seconds for each repetition.
The total length
126

of time for the workout will be roughly 10 minutes, depending on the number of
exercises performed.
Proper stretching can significantly improve an individual's joint
flexibility.
Improved joint flexibility can increase power by enabling an athlete to
apply force over a greater distance and usually with more ease and fluidity.
Running Speed
Running speed
is primarily a function of stride frequency and stride length.
Stride
frequency can be defined as the number of steps you take when running for a given
length of time or distance.
It
is a direct reflection of the speed with which you are
able to move your limbs. The ability to move the limbs at an increased velocity relies
on two factors:
fiber type composition of the muscles providing the limb movement,
and the neurological efficiency of the involved muscle groups (i.e., the nervous
system's ability to transmit impulses from the brain to the receptors
in the contracting
muscles).
Not much can be done to dramatically alter a player's genetic components;
however, through proper training, functional capabilities can be enhanced.
Stride
length
is the distance you can cover with each stride.
Stride length requires functional
strength (i.e., ability to apply force through the range of motion) of the extensor
muscles of the hips, knees, and ankles.
The individual should also possess sufficient
flexibility in the joints involved to allow a greater range of motion and fluidity. An
effective program to develop sprinting speed should include work in three distinct
areas:
strength training, flexibility training, and quality sprint training.
Speed
is
basically a result of the rapid application of force by muscular contractions and
is an
important component of muscular power.
Strength Training.
In order to maintain balance between muscle groups, a properly
designed strength training program should include exercises for all the major muscular
structures of the body.
To develop leg strength for sprinting,
all muscle groups of the
lower body should be trained, including the gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, hip
flexors, adductors/abductors, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles. A limited number
of sets should be performed with rep ranges varying according to the desired result.
The relationship between muscular strength and muscular endurance can be
expressed by using the concept of the repetition continuum.
Using rep ranges toward
the lower end of the continuum (6-8 reps) emphasizes muscular strength, while the
rep ranges greater than 10-12, enhance muscular endurance to a greater degree.
To
develop muscular strength for sprinting, the number of repetitions should be kept
toward the lower end of the continuum, in the range of 6-10.
It is important to keep
in mind, however, that the lower the rep range used, the heavier the resistance loads,
and consequently, the greater potential of injury.
Throughout the training year, the
repetition ranges utilized may change to increase muscular strength and muscular
endurance while also introducing variety into the program.
Each repetition should be
performed at a controlled speed of movement for all exercises. As the muscles which
provide leg drive become stronger, their ability to overcome inertia and accelerate
the body mass increases, thus enhancing the athlete's potential for speed.
127

Flexibility Training. A proper strength training program will increase the muscles'
ability to exert force. As stated before, however, this functional strength must be
exerted through an appropriate range of motion.
Flexibility training should include
static stretching of the muscle groups of the lower body, as well as running drills to
increase dynamic flexibility and facilitate a relaxed running style.
Static stretching
should be performed both before (following a warm-up) and especially after the
running workout.
There are a number of form running drills that may be included in
the program.
Drills we have utilized at Penn State include high knees, heel kicks,
power skips, and arm action drills.
Quality Sprinting. The ability to sprint
is an athletic event in itself and requires
precise coordination of agonists/antagonists via specific motor pathways.
The
principle of specificity states that
in order to "fine tune" the motor pathways required
to perform a given skill, an individual should practice the skill exactly as
it will be
performed
in competition.
In other words, by increasing the coordination of the
muscle groups involved in sprinting, speed of movement of these body segments will
increase. An athlete can spend time performing various running drills to increase
dynamic flexibility and to enhance proper technique, but to provide an effective
training stimulus, the program must ultimately include maximal speed sprints.
Generally, the length of the sprints
is determined by the requirements of the particular
event.
For the sport of football, distances ranging from 10 yards up to 50-60 yards
are appropriate.
Initially, a limited number of repetitions (generally between 4 and
10) should be performed. As conditioning levels improve, a greater number of sprints
may be completed.
The key ingredient
is the quality of work.
All quality sprints
should be run full speed (95-100% effort) with complete recovery allowed between
repetitions.
If the recovery time between sprints
is not sufficient, sprint times will
increase and hence the intensity of training declines. When the heart returns to 130
beats per minute, the athlete
is probably approaching nearing adequate recovery.
This
is not an absolute reality.
Individuals will respond differently, depending upon
their level of training.
The bottom line
is that an athlete should feel almost fully
recovered before sprinting again.
Anaerobic Capacity
Anaerobic conditioning (sometimes referred to as "sprint conditioning")
is necessary
to increase an individual's ability to perform repeated maximal bursts of activity
interspersed with periods of rest. The goal of the anaerobic conditioning portion of
the workout is to overload the anaerobic system to increase the ability of the body to
supply energy (ATP) to the muscles
in the absence of oxygen.
During anaerobic
conditioning, the intensity of effort will be high, but because of the increased amount
of exercise and shorter rest intervals, the absolute speed of the repetitions may not
be as high as in "speed" sprinting. The goal
is to place an effective metabolic demand
on the athlete rather than worrying about maximal speed repeats.
In order to train
the anaerobic system, exercise intervals should be kept below two minutes because
aerobic energy stores are increasingly called upon as exercise intervals increase in
duration.
If the exercise intervals used are 30 seconds or longer, the rest intervals
128

on the athlete rather than worrying about maximal speed repeats.
In order to train
the anaerobic system, exercise intervals should be kept below two minutes because
aerobic energy stores are increasingly called upon as exercise intervals increase in
duration.
If the exercise intervals used are 30 seconds or longer, the rest intervals
should be initially set at three to four times as long. As conditioning improves, this
exercise/rest ratio may decrease to 1-to-1
or even 1-to- 1/2,
in order to provide
progressive overload.
If the sprint distances chosen are 20 seconds or less, recovery
periods should be limited to 10-15 seconds. The sprint distances chosen will depend
on the demands of the sport or position.
Keep
in mind that
it is difficult to "condition"
the athlete with very short sprints.
Sprints shorter than 20 yards should be used for
agilities and other position-specific drills.
For sprint conditioning purposes, distances
at least 20 yards or greater are most effective.
The total number of repetitions
performed in the sprint conditioning period will depend on the length of the exercise
interval (sprint distance).
Increasing the amount of exercise
is another method to
provide progressive overload. Remember that the total volume (amount) of exercise
will be greater than that performed during the quality sprint portion of the workout.
As the number of repetitions increases, they can be segmented
in order to allow an
extended rest period (2-10 minutes) between sets.
Aerobic Capacity
Aerobic capacity refers to the ability of an individual to use oxygen during prolonged
and strenuous exercise. An athlete's ability to recover from all-out, intermittent
bursts of activity is highly related to his aerobic capacity.
All factors considered, a
football player with a high aerobic capacity will be able to perform longer, with less
fatigue, and at a higher level of functioning than one with a low aerobic capacity.
A football player can significantly improve his aerobic capacity by adhering to the
following basic guidelines:
• Engage in continuous, dynamic activities that involve the large muscles of the
body (e.g., running, cycling, stair climbing, etc.)
• Exercise at a level of intensity that
is equivalent to 70-85% of maximum
capacity (i.e., a training of between 150-175 beats per minute for most high
school-age and college-age football players).
• Sustain the aerobic activity for a duration of at least 20 minutes but not more
than 60 minutes.
• Perform the aerobic activity three to five times per week.
Agility
Agility, like speed,
is largely influenced by the precise coordination that occurs
between the muscular and nervous systems.
In order for an athlete to experience
optimal improvement in agility, the agility drills performed during training should
mimic skills the athlete must perform in competition (drills involving agility can been
found in Chapters 8 and
9).
The remark of the old football coach upon watching
129

players perform the traditional tire drill during practice illustrates a proper view of
agility drills: "We don't have tires on the football fields for games in our conference."
Quickness
Response time
is the time required for an individual to initiate a response to a specific
stimulus and to move part of his body from one point to another.
Coaches often refer
to this motor skill as "quickness".
Obviously, this
is a highly valuable trait for football
players.
Like agility, the most effective methods for improving an athlete's quickness
are general conditioning and specificity training.
To enhance quickness, an athlete
should adhere to the following general principles:
• Place a demand on all involved systems.
• Regular practice of all specific skills
• Engage in a sound strength training program.
130

Eat to Compete: Nutrition For Football
Research has shown that coaches can be important sources of nutrition information
for athletes—particularly the adolescent athlete.
Because the nutritional habits that
an individual develops in high school usually continue throughout his college athletic
career and into adulthood,
it is critical that coaches encourage their athletes to
adhere to sound nutritional practices. While almost all available data on the subject
indicates that no single food will make an individual into a champion, a corresponding
amount of evidence suggest that poor nutritional habits can— in fact—prevent an
athlete from playing up to his genetic potential.
Besides the effect on an individual's
gridiron performance, an unsound diet will also have a negative affect on a player's
health—an impact of profound importance.
In order to be able to offer sound advice concerning nutrition fundamentals, a
coach
should be able to address and answer the following three questions (issues) with his
players;
• What should be included
in a training diet?
• What should be eaten the day before a game?
• What should be eaten for a pre-game meal?
The Training Diet
Calories for growth, development, basal metabolism, and physical activity are derived
from three main sources:
carbohydrates, protein and fat.
While
it is true that alcohol
can contribute many calories to an individual's diet, this drug
is not
a useful source
of calories for competitive athletes (or for anyone else for that matter).
Since the major energy source for muscular contraction
is derived from stored
carbohydrates
in the form of liver and muscle glycogen, the diet should be high
in
carbohydrates, A diet that
is 55 to 60% carbohydrates will maintain glycogen stores
during the training season. When too
little carbohydrate
is eaten, these stores
become low.
After several days on a low carbohydrate diet in combination with daily
two-hour workouts, muscle glycogen levels can decrease to less than 50% of normal.
These low levels can contribute to feelings of tiredness, soreness, and general
fatigue.
If humans had to depend only on their glycogen stores to support daily living
activities, we would run out of energy in less than 24 hours.
Because of this
inadequate amount and because athletes rely on these stores for the majority of their
energy expenditure, a diet high
in carbohydrate
is necessary.
131

Not only is
it recommended that an athlete's diet be high
in carbohydrates, but the
sources of his carbohydrates should be mostly complex carbohydrate or starch.
Foods
such as pasta, bread, muffins, bagels, rice, potatoes, and cereals are recommended
rather than foods high in simple sugar.
While
it is true that sweet foods such as soda
pop, candy, and desserts contribute to glycogen stores, these foods do not contain
other essential vitamins and minerals.
For this reason, athletes are encouraged to
eat the more nutrient dense, starch foods rather than sweets to build muscle glycogen.
Because any players feel that they need a snack before afternoon practice, they often
reach for a candy bar and can of soda. While this sugar snack does provide a feeling
of well-being and give "energy" during the early stages of practice, they may find that
after about 30 to 60 minutes a feeling of sluggishness sets in
. The reason for this
sluggishness
is that the sugar in the snack does not maintain the blood sugar level
as long as a snack would which combines protein, fat, and carbohydrate. A better
snack before practice would be a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cheese and
crackers, or a piece of fruit.
Most athletes find
it surprising that their protein needs are not as high as they
believe.
It is true that athletes require more protein than non-athletes.
It is also true
that growing athletes require more protein than adult athletes.
However, the extra
food that is eaten to support growth and the athletic activity fulfills the protein needs
of the athlete.
In this way the athlete
is eating both calories and protein for growth
and muscle development. An example of how an athlete can fulfill his need for protein
is as follows:
T. D. Smith
is a 17 year old football player and weighs 190 lbs. (86.4 kilograms).
He
requires between
1 .0 and
1 .5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
From these
calculations then, he needs to eat between 86 and 129 grams of protein each day.
T. D.
could obtain
1
1
grams of protein from eating two low-fat yogurts, three ounces of baked
chicken breast, one cup of green peas, and four, eight-ounce cartons of skim milk.
The
vegetable protein contributed by complex carbohydrates will easily push T D. beyond his
actual requirement.
It
is not unusual to find that football players consume two to three times the amount
of protein that they need to continue to grow and develop more muscle. The research
is not clear about the hazards of eating excessive amounts of protein over a long
period of time.
It is known, however, that excessive consumption of protein
is not
beneficial for athletes. Two basic arguments exist for encouraging athletes not to
consume excessive amounts of protein.
First of all, protein that the body does not
need
is not stored as protein.
Depending on the energy needs of the body, this extra
protein
is stored as fat or used for energy.
To use dietary protein as a source of
energy is a very inefficient metabolic process.
Dietary carbohydrate
is a much better
source of energy.
Secondly, when extra dietary protein
is metabolized,
its nitrogen
protein
is excreted
in the urine in the form of urea.
In order to excrete these large
132

diets increase the athlete's risk of dehydration.
For these two reason,
it
is
recommended that approximately 15% of the calories come from the protein in foods.
Many advertisements promote the use of "protein drinks" or "protein powders" for
weight gain or increases
in muscle mass.
These products typically contain both a
carbohydrate and a protein source and simply add extra calories to the athlete's diet.
It is true that muscular development does not occur without enough calories, but the
typical high school or collegiate football player eats enough protein and calories for
muscle growth.
If a player buys one of these expensive products in the hopes of
gaining weight, his money would be better spent by eating "normal food" more often
during the day so that he has more opportunities to consume more calories. When
liquid supplements are preferred for between meal snacks, instant breakfast drinks
made with 2% milk can be used. These instant drinks can be purchased at a
supermarket and are much less expensive than weight gain powders.
While weight gain and muscle building powders continue to be advertised, a newer
addition to the marketplace
is single amino acid supplements.
It is true that amino
acids are the "building blocks" of proteins since all proteins are made up of amino
acids.
It is also true that eight are considered to be "essential"—that
is, these eight
amino acids cannot be made or synthesized by the body and must be eaten. What is
not true, however,
is that supplements of amino acids are needed by healthy football
players.
For example, one egg, two eight-ounce cartons of milk and a three-ounce
hamburger provides an excess of essential amino acids for a 170 pound young athlete.
Unfortunately, however, eating an excessive amount of amino acids can have a
negative impact on an athlete.
Just as described above, they will not be stored as
amino acids in the body, but will be inefficiently utilized or stored as fat. Amino acid
supplementation also has the potential to increase the risk of dehydration.
Furthermore, they are very expensive.
In the past several years, arginine and ornithine—two amino acids that the body
makes plenty of—have been promoted for their growth hormone releasing capabilities.
They are advertised to athletes under the guise that in high amounts, these amino
acids can stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.
It is
further believed that extra growth hormone causes larger muscles. The facts about
arginine and ornithine are as follows:
• When administered to people with a suspected growth hormone deficiency,
these amino acids are used to see
if the growth hormone secretion
is normal.
• Because the liver quickly metabolizes the extra amino acids not required by
the body,
it is unlikely that these oral supplements have any effect on growth
hormone release.
133

• Adults with diseases that cause an abnormally large secretion of growth
hormone are not necessarily thin or good athletes.
Quite to the contrary, they
suffer from acromegaly.
This disorder causes disfiguring enlargements of the
bones of the face, hands and feet. They also sometimes suffer from symptoms
similar to those of diabetes.
Similar to the aforementioned discussion on protein, the money spent for these amino
acids would be much better spent on high carbohydrate foods to increase muscle
glycogen stores.
The final nutrient in the training diet that provides calories
is fat. As might be
expected, the recommendation for fat consumption for the high school or collegiate
football player
is lower than what is typically consumed. Many athletes obtain 40%
of their calories from fat, although a diet which has a fat content of 30% or lower is
recommended.
Often calories from fat are not readily obvious.
Since one teaspoon
of margarine, butter,
oil, or mayonnaise contains 45 calories and
is pure fat,
it is
relatively easy to eat much more fat than you would expect.
Since foods that are
high
in complex carbohydrates or starches are not high
in fat, an athlete's fat intake
normally tends to decrease as he eats more carbohydrates.
Fluids are also an important factor in the training diet. The best fluid replacer for a
football player
is cool water.
Fluids that contain sugar are not emptied from the
stomach or intestinal tract as quickly as water.
If players believe that they need a
sugared beverage, diluting a commercial drink with three parts of water to one part
beverage
is a good compromise.
Excessive water loss through perspiration can lead to a dangerous situation for a
football player. A loss of only 3% of the body weight can lead to impaired
performance, while heat exhaustion can begin when 5% of the body's weight has
been
lost.
To avoid this, athletes should be required to drink water before practice,
during practice, and after practice.
Each one pound of weight lost during practice or
a game should be replaced with two cups of water.
The Meals Eaten the Day Before the Game
If a player
is eating a diet that is normally high
in carbohydrates, he may not need to
make any dietary changes the day before a game. Many players use the day before
to eat foods high
in carbohydrate to maximize their glycogen stores.
Since glycogen
synthesis takes several hours, there
is time to do this the day before, but not the day
of a game.
Several hours are also needed to ensure maximal hydration of the body.
The night before an early afternoon game
is also a good time to drink extra water.
The Pre-Game Meal
The purpose of the pre-game meal
is two-fold.
First of all,
it should keep the players
from getting hungry during the game.
Secondly, the pre-game meal
is important to
134

from getting hungry during the game.
Secondly, the pre-game meal
is important to
provide fluids to maintain or improve the players' hydration status.
Beyond these
two guidelines,
it
is difficult to make specific recommendations because many
psychological factors have been linked to the pre-game meal.
For many players this
meal
is smaller than other meals. As a standard rule of thumb, most nutritionist
recommend that a pre-game meal should contain approximately 500 calories.
Furthermore, this meal usually should not contain spicy foods, unless these are
typically consumed.
It should be low in fat, because fat slows the emptying of the
stomach.
Food
left in the stomach and intestinal tract at the beginning of the game
may cause nausea or cramping.
Since anxiety and excitement also slow digestion,
a high fat meal can add to these gastrointestinal problems.
Players who are
particularly bothered by anxiety may prefer to drink liquid meals. These are emptied
from the stomach faster than a meal of solid food.
Once again, the fluid of choice at the pre-game meal
is water.
If the team eats
together at a restaurant, coaches should request that pitches of cold water be put on
the tables.
The availability of water may encourage players to refill their glass more
often.
While coffee, tea, and cola beverages are high
in water, these are not
recommended because of the caffeine content.
Caffeine acts as a diuretic and a
central nervous system stimulant.
Caffeine can cause water loss from the body and
can increase an athlete's level of nervous excitement before the game.
Conclusion
Nutrition recommendations for athletes have undergone dramatic changes in the past
fifteen years.
Unfortunately, while the amount of interest and research
in sports
nutrition has greatly increased the knowledge available to coaches and athletes, the
level of nutrition misinformation has also flourished.
Hopefully, the recommendations,
explanations, and ideas presented
in this chapter will help you answer your players'
questions and contribute to their winning performance.
