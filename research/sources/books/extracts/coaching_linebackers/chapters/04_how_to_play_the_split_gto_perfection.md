How to Play the "Split G^'to Perfection
The basic alignment in the Penn State multiple defensive scheme
is the Split 6.
The
numerous variations of the Split 6 Defense and the role that linebackers play in these
defenses are outlined as follows:
I.
Split 6 Rotate Defense*
A.
Inside linebackers
1. Alignment rules:
• Align three yards deep.
• The inside linebacker, on the side of the flanker, aligns his outside foot
on the inside foot of the defensive tackle (refer to diagram 5.1
).
• The inside linebacker, away from flanker, aligns himself by straddling the
inside leg of the defensive tackle (refer to diagram 5.1
).
2. Keys:
In order to diagnose certain plays, linebackers must be able to key specific
offensive players.
Inside linebackers read the near triangle.
They focus
on the bail but see the near guard and near back out of their peripheral
vision (refer to diagram 5.2).

The movement of an inside linebacker is dictated by the movement of the near
triangle.
On plays toward the linebacker, he should slide laterally to get square with
the offensive tackle and pursue from inside to outside. The inside linebacker's actions
are dictated by:
• The ball coming his way (refer to diagram 5-3).
DIAGRAM S-3
• The guard pulling (anytime the guard pulls he takes precedence over the
action of the ball or the running backs) (refer to diagram 5-4).
DIAGRAM &4
The flow comes his way—the quarterback reverse pivots but both backs
come in the direction of the linebacker (refer to diagram 5-5).
DIAGRAM S-S
22

On action away from an inside linebacker, he attacks the nose of the offensive center
(refer to diagrams 5-6a, 5-6b, 5-6c).
His focal point
is the nose of the center where
he
is aligned before the snap of the ball.
If the center charges off the line of
scrimmage at an angle to handle the gap on the side that the play is going, the
linebacker should move behind the center and take a flat angle of pursuit.
If the
offensive center blocks the linebacker, the linebacker should square up against the
center and keep everything on his play side shoulder in order to guard against
cutbacks (refer to diagram 5-6d).

When the quarterback goes straight back or an offensive hneman sets up for pass
protection, the linebacker should start to his pass zone but remain alert for draw
plays (refer to diagram 5-10).

Pass coverage responsibilities:
• Roll-out action toward the linebacker—slide, near hook or curl (refer to
diagram 5-11).

Straight drop back—curl (refer to diagram 5-1 2).

Roll-out action away from the linebacker (refer to diagram 5-13).

Option responsibilities:
The inside linebackers are responsible for the veer (refer to diagram 5-14).
DIAGRAM S-14
5.
Play is against two wide receivers—separated by more than five
yards—to one side (twins):
The inside linebackers have the same responsibilities toward them (except
on an action pass)—they must contain
( refer to diagram 5-1 5).

B.
Outside linebackers
1.
Alignment rules:
• Align nose on the inside eye of a normally positioned (one yard split) tight
end
.
•
If the tight end splits out to two yards, align on the inside half of the tight
end (refer to diagram 5-16).

DUGUM S-IS
When away from the strength of the formation and the tight end splits
from two to three yards, the defensive end to the inside and the linebacker
should line up on the tight end at a depth of two yards (refer to diagram
5-17).
(8)00
E

DIAGRAM 5-18
When aligned on the same side as two eNgible receivers (the strength of
the formation) and the tight end or slot splits more than two yards, the
defensive end should switch to the inside and the linebacker should move
out on the inside receiver up to six yards from the offensive tackle at a
depth of about three yards (refer to diagram 5-19).

If the tight end blocks the linebacker, the proper reaction is to get square with
the blocker and be ready to move in either direction— most often,
it will be to
the outside (refer to diagram 5-21).
DIAGRAM S^ZI
• After his initial reaction, the linebacker should then react to the next
potential blocker or to the ball.
If the tight end blocks out, the linebacker
should slide with him, quickly recover to his initial position, and be ready
to react to a kick-out by a guard, tackle, or near running back.
He should
keep his shoulders square, react to the pressure of the blocker, and give
ground
if necessary to come off a block (refer to diagram 5-22).
DIAGRAM 5^22
The linebacker should never let a tight end release from the line of
scrimmage to his inside without obstructing him.
If the tight end blocks
down, the linebacker should slide with him, recover to his initial position,
and be ready to react to a kick out block by a guard, tackle, or near running
back.
He should keep his shoulders square, react to the pressure of the
blocker, and give ground
if necessary to come off a block (refer to diagram
5-23).

When the tight end releases for a pass, the linebacker should slide with
him and then react to the action of the quarterback (refer to diagram 5-24).
DIAGRAM »4
When aligned on the side of the formation that does not have a tight end,
the linebacker should key through the offensive tackle to the ball (refer to
diagram 5-25).

Pass coverage responsibilities:
• Roll-out action toward the linebacker—rush with reckless abandon to the
quarterback (refer to diagram 5-26).
DIAGRAM M6
Straight drop back—cover the flat (refer to diagram 5-27).
DIAGRAM S^27
Action away from the linebacker—cover the deep seam, pivot to the inside
and come straight back (refer to diagram 5-28).
DIAGRAM S^ZS

Option responsibilities:
• Against the down the line option (no junction between the quarterback and
a running bacl<), the outside Nnebackers are responsible for the quarterback
(refer to diagram 5-29).

Split 6 (Roll to two deep zone defense coverage versus a drop back pass)
The responsibilities are the same for the linebackers as in rotate coverage, except
on a drop back pass the outside linebacker on the strong side of formation plays
curl, the inside linebacker on the strong side of formation plays middle, the
inside linebacker away from the strong side of formation plays the curl, and the
outside linebacker away from the strong side of formation plays the flat.
This
coverage makes
it possible to cover all five of the underneath pass zones
versus a drop back pass (refer to diagram 5-32).

Split 6 Blitz Defense
The inside linebackers charge straight forward on the snap of the ball.
Although
they try to penetrate across the line of scrimmage,
they must read the play on
the run. As soon as they diagnose the play or get blocked, they should adjust
their course. The weak side outside linebacker should play #4 cautious man-for-
man against a pass, while the outside linebacker on the strong side of the
formation will either play #2 cautious man-for-man or curl versus a pass
depending on the coverage (refer to diagram 5-34).
DIAGRAM S^34
V.
Split 6 Blow Defense
The outside linebackers charge directly behind the buttocks of the offensive
tackles.
Against a normal tight end (one yard split), they should open step to
the inside and then come straight up the field.
If the split of the tight end
is
over one yard, they should charge directly to their penetration point.
If the split
is less than one yard, they should switch assignments with the defensive end
34

and step outside the end, move up field, and contain the bail carrier—the
defensive end should charge to the inside on this switch call.
Versus a split
end, the outside linebackers should aim for the nose of the offensive tackle
(refer to diagrams 5-35, 5-36a, 5-36b, 5-36c, 5-36d).
«1o

As soon as the outside linebackers diagnose the play or get blocked they should
adjust their course.
It is important that they go underneath (to the inside) the
offensive tackle trying to pass block them so that they do not interfere with the rush
lanes of the defensive tackle or the defensive end.
The inside linebackers play laterally against all runs and are responsible for the
quarterback against a hook-up option
(i.e., the quarterback fakes to one of the backs
before attacking the corner).
For all passes, the inside linebacker away from formation
plays #4 cautious man-for-man, and the inside linebacker on the side of the formation
plays #3 or curl depending on the coverage (refer to diagram 5-37).

Vi.
Split 6 Storm Defense
On the snap of the ball, both outside linebackers charge through the inside half
of a tight end
in a normal alignment.
The inside linebacker on the side of
formation blitzes, while the inside linebacker away from formation performs
barrel maneuver. On a barrel maneuver, the linebacker charges through the inside
half of the offensive tackle on the snap.
It is important to note that when he hits
the penetration point that his shoulders are square to the line of scrimmage (refer
to diagram 5-38).
