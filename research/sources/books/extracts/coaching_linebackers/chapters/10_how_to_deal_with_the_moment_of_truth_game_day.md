How to Deal With the Moment of Truth— Game Day
The basic alignment in the Penn State multiple defensive scheme
is the Split 6.
The
numerous variations of the Split 6 Defense and the role that linebackers play in these
defenses are outlined as follows:Game day
is the players' day. A coach's duties on
game day will vary from one staff to another.
However, some common responsibilities
pertaining to the linebackers exist.
Essentially, the linebacker coach should make
himself available should any problems arise.
He should answer all questions that the
players might have.
Occasionally, he may remind them of some specific points to
remember but will do so without causing any confusion or uncertainty (remember:
do not "overcoach").
Every coach approaches each game slightly differently.
In
general, however,
all coaches should make certain that their players are alert without
being tense. The basic objective
is to make each player feel as though he
is well-
prepared and ready to make an all-out effort, regardless of who his opponent might
be.
One of the responsibilities of the linebacker coach
is to "warm up" the linebackers.
It is important that the players begin to "sweat" and prepare themselves both
physically and mentally for the upcoming contest.
In most situations, the various phases
of the warm-up period for linebackers involve the following steps:
• Stretch as a team.
• Eive or six minutes of pass defense drill:
- terminal back pedal.
-
lateral start.
- angle interception.
• r\/lovement drills:
-
lateral start.
- continual sliding.
-
lateral run.
• Work with a partner:
- low blocks.
- bounce the shoulders.
- form tackles.
• Deliver the blow drill.
• Fumble recovery drill.
Once the game begins, the linebacker coach must try to remember to:
• Remain as focused, yet as objective, as possible.
• Work with and utilize the other assistant coaches.
• Know the defenses and the situations in which they are being used.

Evaluate the defense, particularly the play of the linebackers.
Record any mistakes or problems (recognize the opponent's plays that are
hurting the team).
Discuss these mistakes or problems with the linebackers when they come off
the field.
Confer with the other coaches
if problems have been identified which need
their input.
Review mistakes and problems during halftime, make the appropriate
adjustments, and review what is expected to happen
in the second half of the
game.
