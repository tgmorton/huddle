For most teams, preparation for a Friday or Saturday game begins the day after the

All team situations are different however.
Various coaching staffs
have their own methods of preparations.
Certain items, however,
should not be
overlooked. The basic day-to-day responsibilities of the linebacker coach during the
week of the game are outlined as follows:
Sunday

opponent.
• All available game films are evaluated.
• A list of the opponent's strengths
is developed.
• Charts of the opponent's running plays with the exact blocking schemes are
prepared.
• Charts of the underneath pass plays with the exact breaking points of the
primary receivers are drawn.
• Notes are made of any special problems, things to emphasize, and adjustments
that might be considered.
• The films of Saturday's game are reviewed.
• The linebackers are shown one or two reels of film of their upcoming opponent.

A SAMPLE DEFENSE AND EVALUATION SHEET
(Example 4)
• 8 Rotate.
A good all around defense that should be sound against everything. Some
concern may exist regarding a deep pass when
in a "Sam" adjustment.
• 6 Rotate.
Good versus the outside veer to a tight end.
It
is a good "change up' versus
twins — better versus the pass; not as good versus the down-the- line option.
• 57 Rotate.
Helps the pass defense
if beating rotation.
Provides a "change up" versus the
"I" running game.
Is questionable versus much flanker into the sideline.
• 57 Switch.
"Change up" versus 5-man-out pass game.
• 52 Rotate.
Tightens up the inside.
Is an excellent pass coverage and
is better than 57
versus flanker into the sideline.
• 52 Gap Rotate.
Helps on running game to the weak side.
• State.
Tightens the inside running game and
is balanced.
Is not a very good pass
defense.
• 6 Short
Should be used
in desperation to handle the underneath pass zones.
• 52 Gap Tough Rotate.
Short yardage defense.
• 6 Blitz.
'Change up" versus inside running and pass game.
• 6 Gun.
Is our best all-around defense, especially versus boot passing game.
• 6 Storm.
To be used in desperation.

Last play defense.
