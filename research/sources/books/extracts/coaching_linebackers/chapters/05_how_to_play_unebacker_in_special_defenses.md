How to Play Unebacker in Special Defenses
Once the basic defense has been learned,
it
is relatively easy to teach other defenses.
Each supplemental defense complements the basic defense, and all play a valuable
role within the total defensive package. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss a
few of the more commonly used supplemental defenses and to identify the techniques
and responsibilities of
linebackers who are playing
in these defenses.
I.
Four-four Rotate Defense
The secondary rotates to the side of the action (refer to diagram 6-1).

Once the basic defense has been learned,
it is relatively each to teach other defenses.

DUURUIB^Z
Line up slightly outside a tight end that is split two yards (refer to diagram
6-3).
DIAGRAM 6-3
When an offensive end
is split over two yards, all of the adjustments
become the same as those for the Split 6 (refer to diagram 6-4)
Against a tight wing (one that is split not wider than two yards), align
same as the Split 6 (refer to diagram 6-4).
DIAGRAM 64
39

In the case of a 3-yard split by a wingback, the outside linebacker should
line up two yards deep and nose up on the wingback (refer to diagram
6-5).

• Against a straight down-the-line option, play the pitch.
• Versus a "hood-up" option, play the quarterback to pitch.
Try to string out
the quarterback, make him pitch the ball, and then pursue at a proper angle
to the bail.
Pass Responsibility
Pass responsibility is the same as the Split 6 Rotate Defense except the
outside linebacker contains when the ball comes in his direction (refer to
diagram 6-7).

The inside linebacl<er who
is stronger but less mobile (referred to as the
Mike) lines up on the center in a three or four point stance.
He plays
square into the center, reads his head, and rushes the passer once the
threat of a draw no longer exists. The other inside linebacker (referred
to as the Backer) should assume an alignment and adhere to the following
basic rules of play:
• Line up three yards deep and stack the offensive center.
• Key the ball and flow to the ball as required
in the Split 6 Rotate
Defense.
• Against a run action, he should play lateral to the offensive guard and
then pursue from inside to outside (refer to diagram 6-10).

Summary
Several possible defensive adjustments have been presented
in this section in order
to provide you with a better understanding of the multiplicity of defensive schemes
and responsibilities of linebackers in those schemes.
It is not necessary to use all of
these adjustments
in a game or during an entire season.
It
is your responsibility as
the coach to identify which defenses best meet your situational needs and best suit
your personnel.
Finally,
it
is critical that you take the appropriate steps to ensure
that every linebacker who plays for you knows and carries out his responsibilities on
every defensive scheme. The success of your team's defensive efforts are dependent
upon the ability of each player to properly execute his duties on every play from
scrimmage.

What Are the Fundamentals and Principles
off Defensive Play?
Coaches should always attempt to avoid misunderstandings and to be consistent in
their expectations regarding their players. One of the best ways to accomplish this
goal
is to develop a list of fundamentals and principles of defensive play. Many of
the most commonly accepted basic fundamentals have been passed down from one
successful coach to another.
Research, playing experience, common sense, and film
analysis have all played integral parts
in contributing new ideas.
After the proper
methods and techniques have been determined, the players should be drilled to
develop proficiency in the requisite skills and techniques.
It is very important to realize that many ways exist to develop skill proficiency in your
athletes.
By the same token, you should keep in mind that a fine line separates a
disciplined approach and making robots out of your players. We believe that the best
approach for developing linebackers
is one in which they are
trained to perform,
within certain parameters, with a high degree of recklessness.
In order to accomplish
this goal,
it is imperative that certain generic gridiron fundamentals—such as stance,
movement and tackling—must be developed before the techniques specific to position
play.
Stance and Movement
When
in the combat zone (i.e., close proximity to blockers, receivers, and/or ball
carriers),
it
is necessary for a defensive player to be
in a good hitting position.
The
appropriate position for each individual may vary slightly due to differences
in body
builds but a
list of general guidelines concerning what constitutes a proper stance
should include the following:
• His feet should be at least shoulder width apart or slightly wider.
• His toes should be pointed straight forward.
• The weight of his body should be on the toes and balls of his feet but his heels
should not be off the ground.
• His knees should be bent and positioned slightly beyond his feet.
• His legs should be tense (muscles contracted) and ready for sudden movement.
• The player should bend forward at the waist so that his head and chest are
positioned slightly beyond his knees.
• His hands should be positioned slightly outside the knee joint with his palms
facing inward and parallel to his leg.
• His neck should be bulled (i.e., tented) with his eyes looking up at the target.
• His upper body should be relaxed
in order to facilitate ease of movement but
should become tense immediately before contact.
ss

When moving
in the combat area, whether
it
is forward, lateral, or on an angle, the
defender should try to stay very close to the recommended hitting position—the arms
should move freely.
Having a proper stance becomes increasingly more important the
closer a defender is to the offensive players.
Defensive linemen must be able to take
off explosively yet make quick changes of direction as necessary. They must be able
to explode outwards (not up) off of both feet, get under blockers, and continue to
accelerate forward upon contact.
Linebackers must be able to move efficiently (i.e.,
not waste motion or effort) in all directions and not raise or lower themselves anymore
than necessary while moving.
All defenders should strive to be smooth, fluid-moving
athletes.
Among the recommended drills for developing the proper stance and movement
techniques
in players are the following:
• On Command Position
Drill — The defender practices getting into a good
hitting position.
• Stance Walk Drill — The defender walks
in a good hitting position (using
opposite hand-foot movement).
• Stance Run Drill — The defender runs in all directions in a good hitting position
(to get the feel of going as fast as possible yet under control).
• Move-Stop Drill — The defender moves
in various directions, then comes to a
stop
in a good hitting position, ready to play (sprint
- stop, lateral
- stop, etc.).
• Sprint-Gather Drill — The defender sprints forward at full speed, then gathers
himself, coming under control
in a good hitting position.
• Spring-Gather-Attack Drill — Same as sprint-gather drill except after the
defender has come under control, he veers off at approximately a 45° angle (in
good position) as
if attacking a ball carrier.
• Quarter-Eagle Drill — From a good position, the defender makes a quick 90°
turn. The defender should not hop, but turn as quickly as possible by pivoting
his entire body.
The drill should end with a full speed burst (i.e., the defender
turns right, turns back to the left, turns left, turns back to the right, and then
runs full speed right).
Defensive linemen should work on straight ahead starts, then start and make quick
changes of direction after one step (simulating down blocks, reach blocks, etc.).
Linebackers should slide and work on their footwork while simulating various blocking
schemes.
Defensive backs should retreat, then accelerate at the various angles that
a ball might be thrown.
The type of movement used by a defensive player
is determined to a great extent by
the requirements of his position. Among the recommended techniques for moving in
various directions are the following:
S6

Lateral Movement
The defender should not raise or lower himself from his initial stance.
He should
maintain his shoulders relatively parallel (or "square") to the line of scrimmage while
moving laterally.
The direction
in which a defender moves laterally is dictated by a
key or the ball.
The first basic lateral movement is the slide or the shuffle.
This
is the easiest
movement from which to change direction because a player's feet never cross.
Sometimes
it
is only necessary to slide once. A systematic analysis of lateral
movement shows that the defender leans
in the direction to which he wants to go,
slides his back foot (the one opposite the direction that he wants to go) in the
direction of the body lean, and then slides the lead foot in the direction that he
is
going.
It
is very important to note that he does not hop or cross his feet.
This
movement must be a quick move, with his feet remaining as close to the ground as
possible.
The defender's elbows should be kept close to his body. Any upper-body
motion should be minimized.
If play dictates, the defender continues to slide
in this
same manner.
If sliding
is not fast enough, then
it may become necessary to run laterally.
To run in
this manner, the defender should keep his shoulders square and allow his arms to
swing naturally.
Again, the defender leads with his back foot (the one opposite the
direction that he wants to go), but this time he crosses over the other foot (e.g.,
if
going to the
left,
it
is right over,
left out).
• The defender should turn his shoulders to run only as a last resort.
• The defender should not waste motion or become overextended.
• The defender may be able to enhance his movement quickness by performing
the skills required for his position with an all-out effort.
Everything should be
performed with a maximum effort, whether
it is one slide or a forty-yard spring-
any effort less than maximum can and often does become a bad habit.
Forward Movement
When a linebacker
is moving forward, he should employ the following techniques:
• The defender's toes should be pointed straight ahead.
• His weight should be on the balls of his feet.
• He should push (spring) off one foot, paw out with the other.
• As his foot comes down, the defender's body should move forward so that his
center of gravity is over his foot as
it touches.
• His hands and upper body should be relaxed, with his index finger and thumb
cupped. Some players may prefer to move their hands in a paddling-type
motion.
Regardless of how a player moves his hands, his hands and upper
body should be relaxed.
• The defender's elbows should remain close to his sides.
57

• He should employ his opposite hand
in an opposite-foot-movement pattern.
As his left foot goes forward, his right hand shoots upward to shoulder height
and left hand moves backward towards his hip.
• The defender should bend slightly, flexed (bent) at the waist, with his head
tilted slightly downward and his eyes directed straight ahead.
• The defender should try to move as smoothly and fluidly as possible (no wasted
motion).
•
Finally, the defender should concentrate on moving his feet as fast as possible.
Backward Movement
When the linebacker is moving backward, he should employ the following techniques:
• The defender should pump arms (similar to the way he does when he's
moving forward), employing the opposite hand with an opposite-foot-
movement pattern.
• He should push off the ball of one foot and paw back with the other foot.
• His upper body should be relaxed, his elbows
in, and all movements smooth
and fluid.
•
Finally, the defender should keep his knees flexed (bent) and lean forward
in
order to be in a position to be able to change directions quickly.
Shedding Blockers
In playing off blockers,
it is important to do only what is required to make a play. A
defender's primary objective should be to make tackles, not to destroy blockers.
It
is critical that the defender stay square, explode without unnecessary effort, after
contact be able to move before his offensive opponent (i.e., be the first to move after
contact)., react to the blocker's pressure, control the blocker, and come off the block
at an angle to meet the ball carrier (most of the time laterally).
In order to neutralize
a blocker charging above the waist, a defender should:
• Stay square with the blocker, not commit to a slide.
• Take a short step, then drive out and underneath the face mask of the blocker.
The defender should get underneath (vertical leverage) the blocker.
His hands
should be driven underneath the shoulder pads of the blocker. Upon contact,
he should lower his hip and buttocks so that his feet are underneath him.
• Not wind up or waste motion, but instead create maximum explosion with a
minimum amount of wasted effort — think of "stinging" the blocker.
• Not get overextended, but rather maintain a balanced position.
• Strain upward and into the pressure of the blocker while accelerating his feet
upon contact in short, choppy steps.
• Work to get his head up (his back should arch).
• Make an all-out effort to get rid of the blocker.
Push (press) and throw off the
offensive man.
Do not stay blocked! Come off the block laterally and quickly.
58

Among the additional points which should be emphasized regarding shedding blockers
are the following:
• The defender should prevent the blocker from getting a position between
himself and the ball carrier.
• The defender should never spin away from the blocker.
• The defender should strain into the pressure of the block, give ground, keep
his shoulders square, and take a proper pursuit angle,
if a blocker has managed
to position himself between the defender and the ball carrier.
• The defender should not go around the block through the 'back door" (i.e., the
'so-called" easy way).
If a blocker comes down from the outside or out from the inside (at an angle), the
defender should stay square and deliver a blow with his forearm and shoulder.
The
defender should not wind up, but instead make sure that he
is in a good hitting
position.
His lower arm should be flexed (bent) slightly and his elbow driven out from
his body. A defender's shoulder and forearm should be underneath the blocker. As
always, the defender should strain into the pressure of the blocker, accelerate his
feet, stay square, and be ready to give a step and instinctively come off the block at
the proper angle.
When a blocker attacks below the waist, the defender should:
• Concentrate on the blocker, while watching the ball carrier out of his periphery.
• React to the blocker's head, slide in the direction of his head, and strive to
maintain his position.
• Use his hands to stop the offensive man's charge. The defender's hands should
be directed
in the area of the offensive player's shoulder pads.
• Flex (bend) his knees, push with his hands, and give with his feet to clear the
offensive man's charge.
• Keep his shoulders square and make his second move before the offensive
man's charge.
•
If necessary, give ground to keep his shoulders square.
He should not go
around behind the blocker
if the offensive man has good position.
He should
keep moving in the direction that the offensive man
is trying to go.
• Be prepared. A good defender has the ability to side and coil at the same time
in order to be able to strike a blow (butt).
Tackling
An intense desire to excel, proper body position, and proper balance are essential
factors in consistently being able to demonstrate proper tackling techniques.
It is
recommended that when a defender is making a tackle he should:
• Not raise or lower himself from a good hitting position and stay square when
approaching the ball carrier.
• Keep his elbows close to his sides and not wind up.
S9

•
Bull (contract) his neck, keep his eyes open, and stay square to the ball carrier
upon contact.
• Accelerate his feet with short, choppy steps and wrap his arms around the ball
carrier upon contact. His hands should make contact in the area of his
opponent's buttocks then slide up as the ball carrier is taken back.
• Keep his head up, back arched, and always try to look at the ball carrier.
• Drive through the ball carrier, while trying to take him back five yards and put
him on his back.
• Drive his head
in front of a ball carrier that is coming at an angle (not straight
ahead) and then strain upward and into the ball carrier, always turning his
head into the ball carrier to look at him.
The defender should accelerate his
feet in the same manner as for a straight-ahead tackle.
• Keep his eyes open when assisting on a tackle so that he doesn't knock off the
other tackier.
• Spring from his stance and attempt to meet a ball carrier in the air who
is
diving to score a touchdown or get a first down.
•
In most instances, attack ball carriers in the open field — force the ball carrier
to make a decision.
• Use the sideline to his advantage when making a tackle by coming under
control, taking away the runner's inside cut, and forcing him out of bounds.
Pursuit
It
is important that defensive players approach ball carriers at the proper angles.
Using good judgment and taking the proper angle of pursuit can help to overcome the
comparative speed advantage which
is enjoyed by most offensive backs. When
pursuing a ball carrier, some important points for the defender to remember are:
• Inside defenders should try to keep everything on their outside shoulder when
the action comes to their side.
They should pursue in a lateral direction until the
ball carrier has turned upfield and then attack from the inside position.

LB
DIAGRAM 71

When a ball carrier goes away from a defender, fie should maintain a position
slightly to the inside so that he can guard against the cutback.
DIAGRAM 7-2
Attempt to make ball carrier continue to run in a lateral direction.
Try not to
create a seam so that a back can run upfield.
' Take a steeper angle of pursuit (from the line of scrimmage) in order to save a
touchdown when the bail carrier is farther away.
DIAGRAM 7-3
61

When playing the quarterback against the option, pursuit should be at least at
a flat angle to intersect the ball carrier's path once the quarterback has pitched
the ball.
If the ball
is pitched well out in front of the quarterback,
it is necessary
to take a steeper angle (from the line of scrimmage) to meet the ball carrier.
DIAGRAM 7-4
Outside defenders (playing a flat zone) should attack flare and screen passes
from an outside position, attempting to force the ball carrier into the middle
of the field.
DIAGRAM 7 S
62

• Defenders should converge on plays to their inside from an outside-in-angle
(maintain a fence when aligned on the outside).
Pass Defense (Zone)
Defenders playing zone pass defense position themselves at a relative distance to
each other so that they can cover the areas of the field into which a quarterback
might want to throw the ball.
The linebacker's primary concern
is guarding an area
of the field between the defensive backfield and the line of scrimmage and reacting
to the look of a quarterback. A linebacker playing a zone must also be aware of the
positions of potential receivers who might be a threat to his area of responsibility.
The recommended techniques for a linebacker playing zone pass defense are:
• As soon as linebacker recognizes a pass play, he should call
it out and start
moving to his area of responsibility as fast as possible. Assuming a proper
depth initially gives him an opportunity to come under better body control
when the ball
is about to be thrown.
• Most of the time, he should turn and run laterally looking over his shoulder at
the quarterback.
• As he
is going to his zone area, he should glance for receivers who might be
coming into his area, but he should never turn completely away from the ball.
He should know where receivers are, yet still be able to react
if the quarterback
throws quickly into his area or another area.
• He should position himself between the ball and a potential receiver in his
zone. Once he has gotten within about three yards of the receiver, he should
settle down (stop in a basic hitting position) where he can see both the receiver
and the quarterback (match up with the receiver).
He should be turned at
approximately a 45° angle towards the outside, aligned three yards in front of
the receiver and three yards to his inside, concentrating on the ball but
watching the receiver out of his periphery, and being ready to react to any
throws at an angle that would allow him to
intercept the ball.
If the receiver
breaks to the inside behind the linebacker, he should pivot back to face the
ball and react to
it.
•
If no receiver is in his zone (twelve to fifteen yards deep), he should square
his shoulders to the line of scrimmage and begin to back pedal. While running
backwards, his weight should be on the balls of his feet, his arms should move
as
if running, and his elbows should be close to his sides. As he is retreating,
he should scan for receivers.
• He should react to all "looks" of the quarterback in his area. When the
quarterback looks, he should turn his shoulders and sprint at an angle to make
the interception in front of the receiver.
• He should try to catch the ball at its highest point, lock
it into his hands, should
"fire", and head toward the goal
line.
• All of the linebackers should communicate with each other. They should tell
the adjacent linebacker
if a receiver is crossing into his area.
63

•
If a receiver crosses a linebacker's path, he should be knocked to the ground
or at the very least off stride, but the linebacker should not get overextended
or ever go out of his way to hit a receiver. The linebacker should not lose his
position
in attempting to knock down a receiver.
• Once the ball
is thrown, all linebackers should be running at full speed toward
the ball until
it is either intercepted or batted to the ground.
Pass Defense (Man-For-Man)
Defenders playing man-for-man pass coverage should concentrate on the eligible
receivers and cover them wherever they might run. Two types of man-to-man pass
coverage techniques can be used. The linebacker can play reckless man-for-man
coverage when he has help in the deep secondary.
Reckless techniques are used to
take away the underneath passes (from the line of scrimmage to a depth of about
eighteen yards).
Cautious man-for-man techniques, on the other hand, are used when
the linebacker does not have any help in the deep zones, and must, therefore, protect
them. When playing cautious man-for-man pass defense, the linebacker:
• Aligns himself approximately one yard inside the offensive receiver at a depth
of about four yards with his inside foot forward.
• Concentrates on the receiver.
• Begins to run backward, leading with his front foot, as the receiver comes
forward.
• Tries to maintain a distance of two to three yards between himself and the
receiver and maintains a position of one yard to the receiver's inside. As the
receiver gets closer to him, he begins to run laterally In order to maintain his
position (refer to Insert 7-6).
• Breaks parallel to the receiver's changes of directions, and then gradually gets
closer to the receiver as the ball
is thrown.
• Must guard against any deep pass.
• Turns his back to the ball
in pursuit
if the receiver has gotten beyond him,
concentrates on the receiver, especially his hands; and turns toward the
quarterback to look for the ball when the receiver's hands come up.
DIAGRAM 7-6
64

When playing reckless man-for-man with two defensive halfbacks helping in the deep
outside zone, the linebacker:
• Aligns in the same manner as when playing cautious man-for-man pass defense.
• Concentrates on the receiver.
• Does not let the receiver go to his inside, jams him
if he tries to get inside
position.
•
If the receiver releases to the outside, waits (does not move) until the receiver
reaches his outside shoulder and then turns and jams him with his hands.
He
also lets the receiver get slightly ahead so that he can cover the underneath
passes.
• Chases the receiver, staying to the inside and slightly behind him (refer to Insert
7-7).
• Plays all pass cuts of the receiver from underneath (the side closest to the ball),
concentrates on the receiver's hands, and goes for the interception when the
receiver reaches for the ball.
DIAGRAM 77
Catching the Ball
Turnovers, specifically interceptions, can have a major impact on the final outcome
of a game.
For this reason,
it is important that linebackers spend ample practice time
catching thrown balls. Some of the steps that a player should do when receiving a
ball are:
• Concentrate on the ball.
• Look the ball into his hands.
• Do not attempt to run with or look away from the ball until
it
is firmly in his
hands.
6S

• Keep his hands "alert' but not too tense.
• Give with the ball as
it contacts his hands.
• Reach out with his hands and move toward the ball when going for an
interception.
• Put the ball away (i.e., tuck the point of one end of the ball under his arm
covering the other end with his palm and middle fingers).
• Keep his thumbs pointed to the inside
if the ball
is thrown above his waist.
• Keep his thumbs pointed to the outside
if the ball
is thrown below his waist.
• Should yell
"fire" or some other word to let his teammates know that the ball
has been intercepted.
Blitzing
Blitzing can be an effective maneuver to change the normal pattern of linebacker
play. When blitzing, the linebacker attacks an offensive area on the snap of the ball.
Blitzing
is used as an adjustment in an attempt to change the tempo of play, to create
a long yardage situation for the offense, or to break the continuity of an offensive
drive, to rush the passer — especially
if certain blitzes take advantage of an offense's
pass-blocking scheme.
It
is also possible to disrupt blocking assignments or stop
certain running plays by blitzing. When blitzing the linebacker should:
• Not alarm the offense by altering his stance or starting too soon.
• Go immediately on the snap of the ball.
• Attempt to penetrate across the line of scrimmage.
• Notice the offensive linemen and the action of the ball and adjust as they are
moving (inside linebackers should follow pulling guards, etc.).
• Stay under control.
• React to the pressure of blocks as
if he were playing normally.
• Use his hands when rushing the passer (refer to section on Pass Rush).
• Try to get the offensive man turned one way and then go
in the opposite
direction.
