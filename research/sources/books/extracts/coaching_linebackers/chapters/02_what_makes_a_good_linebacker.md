What Makes a Good Linebacker?
A good linebacker typically possesses certain character traits and physical abilities. Some
of these qualities can be measured objectively while others must be subjectively observed.
A coach should try to evaluate the total athlete and then isolate the areas that need further
development and improvement.
Initial decisions by a coach regarding who should play linebacker are most often based
upon demonstrated physical potential. Most of the players chosen to be linebackers should
be good all-around athletes.
For example, many of the outstanding linebackers in Penn
State history have also been good basketball players.
All of the great Nittany Lion
linebackers have been able to move extraordinarily well. Among the physical attributes
that "good" linebackers almost always possess are the following:
Quickness (i.e., able to move from one spot to another in a short period of time).
Agility (i.e., able to quickly change directions and move well laterally).
Good peripheral vision—necessary to be able to see blockers, ball carriers, and pass
receivers at various angles.
Physical toughness and an eagerness for physical contact.
Power and explosiveness in order to shed blockers and make tackles.
Good speed and the ability to accelerate and overtake ball carriers and receivers.
Instincts (i.e., have a sense for the flow of action or "a nose for the football").
Good hands in order to be able to catch the ball.
A good linebacker, however, possesses more than certain physical characteristics. Many
intangible qualities also exist that separate good or great linebackers from average players.
In the end, the suitability of an individual to play linebacker is determined by his ability to
consistently perform well on the gridiron, not by his untapped potential or by any particular
physical quality he may or may not possess.
For example, Sam Mills—an All-Pro linebacker
for the New Orleans Saints— is relatively short for a prototype linebacker, but his "heart"
and his play on the field override his lack of physical size.
All factors considered, however,
the best linebackers are usually:
Able to recognize plays quickly, make the proper reaction and adjust according to the
situation.
Possessed with a feeling for the ball and the ability to translate that feeling into proper
judgment when approaching a ball carrier.
Consistent and mentally tough enough to overcome adversity and perform well under
all circumstances.
Able to concentrate under pressure.
Aware of secondary blockers or receivers.

•
Endowed with a flair for the "big play" and have the knack of being at the right place
at the right time.
•
Alert and capable of directing their teammates.
Subtle differences exist between inside and outside linebackers.
Inside linebackers are
usually more powerful, while outside linebackers tend to be quicker, faster, and better pass
defenders than inside linebackers.
Few physical characteristics exist that are unique for linebackers.
Ideally, however, a
linebacker is someone who has the quickness of a defensive back and the power and
toughness of a defensive lineman.
Of course, each coach must choose his linebackers from
the personnel that is available to him.
