byJoePaterno
My involvement with Penn State football has extended more than forty-two years,
both as an assistant coach and as head coach.
During that time, we have had many
fine football teams and produced countless quality football players. A major factor
in whatever success we've achieved
is the staff of talented assistants with whom
I've had the opportunity to work. None of these assistants has been more devoted to
the precepts of excellence or has exhibited a greater personal commitment to
developing young men than Jerry Sandusky.
Jerry Sandusky
is a man of high standards and deep-seated beliefs
in hard work,
dedication, and honesty.
He has strong feelings toward America, Penn State
University, and the community in which he lives.
He gives of himself to others both
on and off the football field—a commitment perhaps best reflected by his work with
disadvantaged children with his Second Mile program.
And, he
is an extraordinarily
fine teacher.
His coaching efforts with the Penn State football team have played a substantial role
in our team's being awarded the somewhat facetious designation as "Linebacker U."
The
list of linebackers he has worked with over the years reads like a "Who's Who"
of great linebackers—Jack Ham, Greg Buttle, Lance Mehl, Scott Radacic, Shane
Conlan, Andre Collins, etc.
If you want to know more about how to develop linebackers, you could not learn from
a better source.
Coaching Linebackers \n'\\\ provide you with a detailed overview of
the techniques and fundamentals involved
in quality linebacker play.
Jerry Sandusky
is an organized, respected, and highly knowledgeable coach.
This book is destined
to become a fixture in the professional library of football coaches across America.
It
is my privilege and honor to recommend
it to you.


What Makes a Good Linebacker Coach?
The primary purpose of this book is to present a step-by-step progression for coaching
linebackers.
It is intended to serve as a basic guide for football coaches.
While
every coach has his own unique approach to handling linebackers, the procedures
outlined
in this book have proven to be very successful for Penn State.
The Penn State defensive scheme involves four linebackers who play a very integral
part of our defensive pattern. A successful linebacker needs to be a multi-talented
athlete who
is able to defend against both the run and the pass.
Quality linebacker
coaching starts with an athlete who has the ability to perform these functions. An
astute coach can, however, do many things to develop good athletes into great
linebackers.
At the minimum, a linebacker coach should be able to:
Evaluate his athletes' potential and help them to realize that potential.
Develop and implement a sound defensive scheme that effectively utilizes the
skills of his players and offers sufficient flexibility.
Ensure that his players fully understand the specific responsibilities of linebackers.
Explain the techniques that are required for his players to meet with the specific
responsibilities of linebackers.
Design and implement appropriate training drills for improving his players'
linebacking techniques.
Provide mental preparation for the various situations which may arise during a
game.
Analyze his opponents' strengths and weaknesses and effectively communicate
this information to his players.
Make necessary adjustments and offer proper assistance to his linebackers as
specific situations arise during a game.
Evaluate the total performance of his players.
Offer valid suggestions to his linebackers for skill improvement both during the
season and the off-season.
•
Do everything possible to help his players reach their God-given potential.
Given the aforementioned steps, not surprisingly the primary role of a linebacker
coach
is to be a good teacher.
His major responsibility is to help young men to mature
and develop as people and football players.
Every teacher/coach, regardless of the
subject matter, should (to some degree) adhere to the following guidelines to be
effective:

•
Understand and clearly establish his goals.
•
Work with the head coach and other members of the coaching staff.
•
Believe in and understand the concepts that are to be taught.
•
Analyze what he desires to convey to his players and decide on the most
appropriate teaching method.
•
Demand commitment and excellence from both himself and his players.
Contrary to popular opinion, successful coaches are not clones from the same mold.
Individual differences among coaches often exist with regard to teaching style,
discipline, motivation, etc.
Effective linebacker coaches however, almost always will
have certain things
in common.
They will be intense competitors. They will be hard
workers.
They will be enthusiastic. They will have a positive attitude towards their
responsibilities in the athletic arena.
Each of these qualities are traits that they hope
to
instill
in their players.

What Makes a Good Linebacker?
A good linebacker typically possesses certain character traits and physical abilities. Some
of these qualities can be measured objectively while others must be subjectively observed.
A coach should try to evaluate the total athlete and then isolate the areas that need further
development and improvement.
Initial decisions by a coach regarding who should play linebacker are most often based
upon demonstrated physical potential. Most of the players chosen to be linebackers should
be good all-around athletes.
For example, many of the outstanding linebackers in Penn
State history have also been good basketball players.
All of the great Nittany Lion
linebackers have been able to move extraordinarily well. Among the physical attributes
that "good" linebackers almost always possess are the following:
Quickness (i.e., able to move from one spot to another in a short period of time).
Agility (i.e., able to quickly change directions and move well laterally).
Good peripheral vision—necessary to be able to see blockers, ball carriers, and pass
receivers at various angles.
Physical toughness and an eagerness for physical contact.
Power and explosiveness in order to shed blockers and make tackles.
Good speed and the ability to accelerate and overtake ball carriers and receivers.
Instincts (i.e., have a sense for the flow of action or "a nose for the football").
Good hands in order to be able to catch the ball.
A good linebacker, however, possesses more than certain physical characteristics. Many
intangible qualities also exist that separate good or great linebackers from average players.
In the end, the suitability of an individual to play linebacker is determined by his ability to
consistently perform well on the gridiron, not by his untapped potential or by any particular
physical quality he may or may not possess.
For example, Sam Mills—an All-Pro linebacker
for the New Orleans Saints— is relatively short for a prototype linebacker, but his "heart"
and his play on the field override his lack of physical size.
All factors considered, however,
the best linebackers are usually:
Able to recognize plays quickly, make the proper reaction and adjust according to the
situation.
Possessed with a feeling for the ball and the ability to translate that feeling into proper
judgment when approaching a ball carrier.
Consistent and mentally tough enough to overcome adversity and perform well under
all circumstances.
Able to concentrate under pressure.
Aware of secondary blockers or receivers.

•
Endowed with a flair for the "big play" and have the knack of being at the right place
at the right time.
•
Alert and capable of directing their teammates.
Subtle differences exist between inside and outside linebackers.
Inside linebackers are
usually more powerful, while outside linebackers tend to be quicker, faster, and better pass
defenders than inside linebackers.
Few physical characteristics exist that are unique for linebackers.
Ideally, however, a
linebacker is someone who has the quickness of a defensive back and the power and
toughness of a defensive lineman.
Of course, each coach must choose his linebackers from
the personnel that is available to him.
Chapters #3-15 in this text have been written to
enable you (the coach) to get the most out of your players. The techniques, information and
advice have worked well for the Penn State program.
Properly applied, they will work well
for you.

A Basic Game Plan for Success
A multiple eight-man front (eight defensive players around the ball) involving four
linebackers
is a basic defensive scheme which we have successfully used over the
years.
This scheme employs four linebackers (two inside and two outside) who can
be aligned in various positions depending on the defense called.
Having the ability
to position eight defenders around the ball provides more immediate support against
the run. The flexibility of the defensive scheme allows the team to adjust its defenses
to many different types of offenses. Some of the basic different alignments which
are employed from this scheme include:
SPLIT 6 (BASIC DEFENSE)
Strong Side

Disadvantages:
•
It
is difficult to cover the strong side flat pass zone by an outside linebacker
who
is aligned on the tight end.
•
The outside linebackers are not aligned
in an advantageous position to support
against plays that are run up the middle of the defense.
•
Being a balanced defense,
it is impossible to overshift in the directon of the opponent's
strength.

EAGLE
Strong Side

Advantages:
•
The defense provides more support for the middle and off-tackle holes.
•
This scheme decreases the number of seams in the defense because of the man
on-man alignment.
•
The defense
is overshifted to the strength of the offense.
This makes
it an
especially good defense to be played when the ball
is on or close to a hash
mark.
•
An opportunity exists to have a balanced three-man pass rush.
•
The outside linebacker on the strong side of the field
is in better position to play
the "flat" pass zone.
Disadvantages:
•
Immediate run support
is unavailable against outside plays which are run to the
weak side (away from the offense's strength).
•
The inside linebackers are not in an advantageous position to pursue outside
plays quickly or get to their pass zones quickly.
•
A defensive end must get involved
in pass coverage in order to cover the
underneath passing zones.

Disadvantages:
•
The middle of the defense
is more vulnerable to the run because the middle
linebacker aligns in a softer position (i.e., off the line of scrimmage).
•
Immediate run support in unavailable against outside plays which are run to the
weak side (away from the offense's strength).
•
Except for the strong side outside linebacker, the linebackers are not aligned in
a good position to retreat quickly to their passing zones.
•
The inside linebacker who is aligned on the strong side is not in an advantageous
position to pursue outside running plays.

Each of these different schemes will usually cause many blocking adjustments by the
offense. They also provide you with the potential for a wide variety of games (stunts).
If you use a multiple eight-man front, your defense can play with reckless abandon,
however, your linebackers must be aggressive and want to make things happen.
The
flexibility afforded by this basic defensive scheme places a relatively greater burden
upon your linebackers because they must be able to recognize plays from the various
alignments.
Having eight people around the ball also makes
it more difficult for the
linebackers to play zone pass defense because there are greater distances for them
to run to their pass zones.
All of those situations require that your linebackers in this
defensive scheme must be alert, intelligent, and highly mobile in order to handle their
assignments.
16

What Are the General Responsibilities of a Linebacker?
In order to understand the proper approach to coaching linebackers,
it is necessary
to understand the basic responsibilities of linebackers.
Within a coaches' defensive
game plan, each defense used
is designed to stop certain offensive plays.
Toward
that end, the linebackers' assignments will vary with the defenses that are called.
Some general assignments, however, exist which linebackers must be able to handle
to effectively play within the Penn State defensive scheme.
Our linebackers must be able to:
•
Diagnose running plays, provide strong support to the defensive linemen, and
control their areas of responsibility.
•
Recognize and quickly take the proper angle of pursuit against outside plays
(sweeps, options, etc.).
Inside linebackers pursue from inside to outside (refer
to diagram 4-1
), keeping the ball carrier on their outside shoulder (the shoulder
on the side of the direction
in which they are going).
Outside linebackers should
pursue straight down the line of scrimmage or give ground slightly once the ball
has gotten outside of them (refer to diagram 4-2).
DIAGRAM 41
17

DIAGRAM 4-2
•
Blitz (immediately attack an offensive area on the snap of the ball).
•
Play zone pass defense (covering a specific area of the field—flats, curls,
middle).
•
Play man-for-man pass defense (covering an offensive receiver).
In this area of
responsibility, a linebacker can either approach his duties cautiously (covering an
offensive receiver when you do not have deep help) or aggressively (taking away
the passes in the area from the line of scrimmage to eighteen yards deep, knowing
that deep help
is available).
•
Recognize the offensive formation and make adjustments to unanticipated
situations.
The ability of each linebacker usually determines the defensive alignment.
If all
backers are of equal ability,
it is generally most advantageous to simply align them
according to sides (left and right).
However,
if your linebackers are more or less
capable in certain areas,
it may be necessary to align them in various positions
according to the placement of the football (i.e., short side vs. wide side) or the type
of offensive formations being used
(i.e., weak side vs. strong side (refer to diagrams
4.3a and 4.3b).

How to Play the "Split G^'to Perfection
The basic alignment in the Penn State multiple defensive scheme
is the Split 6.
The
numerous variations of the Split 6 Defense and the role that linebackers play in these
defenses are outlined as follows:
I.
Split 6 Rotate Defense*
A.
Inside linebackers
1. Alignment rules:
• Align three yards deep.
• The inside linebacker, on the side of the flanker, aligns his outside foot
on the inside foot of the defensive tackle (refer to diagram 5.1
).
• The inside linebacker, away from flanker, aligns himself by straddling the
inside leg of the defensive tackle (refer to diagram 5.1
).
2. Keys:
In order to diagnose certain plays, linebackers must be able to key specific
offensive players.
Inside linebackers read the near triangle.
They focus
on the bail but see the near guard and near back out of their peripheral
vision (refer to diagram 5.2).
Strong Side
o
E

The movement of an inside linebacker is dictated by the movement of the near
triangle.
On plays toward the linebacker, he should slide laterally to get square with
the offensive tackle and pursue from inside to outside. The inside linebacker's actions
are dictated by:
• The ball coming his way (refer to diagram 5-3).
DIAGRAM S-3
• The guard pulling (anytime the guard pulls he takes precedence over the
action of the ball or the running backs) (refer to diagram 5-4).
DIAGRAM &4
The flow comes his way—the quarterback reverse pivots but both backs
come in the direction of the linebacker (refer to diagram 5-5).
DIAGRAM S-S
22

On action away from an inside linebacker, he attacks the nose of the offensive center
(refer to diagrams 5-6a, 5-6b, 5-6c).
His focal point
is the nose of the center where
he
is aligned before the snap of the ball.
If the center charges off the line of
scrimmage at an angle to handle the gap on the side that the play is going, the
linebacker should move behind the center and take a flat angle of pursuit.
If the
offensive center blocks the linebacker, the linebacker should square up against the
center and keep everything on his play side shoulder in order to guard against
cutbacks (refer to diagram 5-6d).
DIAGRAM »A

When the quarterback goes straight back or an offensive hneman sets up for pass
protection, the linebacker should start to his pass zone but remain alert for draw
plays (refer to diagram 5-10).
DIAGRAM S^IO
3.
Pass coverage responsibilities:
• Roll-out action toward the linebacker—slide, near hook or curl (refer to
diagram 5-11).
DIAGRAM S^ll
Straight drop back—curl (refer to diagram 5-1 2).
DIAGRAM S-12

Option responsibilities:
The inside linebackers are responsible for the veer (refer to diagram 5-14).
DIAGRAM S-14
5.
Play is against two wide receivers—separated by more than five
yards—to one side (twins):
The inside linebackers have the same responsibilities toward them (except
on an action pass)—they must contain
( refer to diagram 5-1 5).
DIAGRAM S^IS
26

B.
Outside linebackers
1.
Alignment rules:
• Align nose on the inside eye of a normally positioned (one yard split) tight
end
.
•
If the tight end splits out to two yards, align on the inside half of the tight
end (refer to diagram 5-16).
<8)00 O
DUGUM S-IS
When away from the strength of the formation and the tight end splits
from two to three yards, the defensive end to the inside and the linebacker
should line up on the tight end at a depth of two yards (refer to diagram
5-17).
(8)00
E

DIAGRAM 5-18
When aligned on the same side as two eNgible receivers (the strength of
the formation) and the tight end or slot splits more than two yards, the
defensive end should switch to the inside and the linebacker should move
out on the inside receiver up to six yards from the offensive tackle at a
depth of about three yards (refer to diagram 5-19).

If the tight end blocks the linebacker, the proper reaction is to get square with
the blocker and be ready to move in either direction— most often,
it will be to
the outside (refer to diagram 5-21).
DIAGRAM S^ZI
• After his initial reaction, the linebacker should then react to the next
potential blocker or to the ball.
If the tight end blocks out, the linebacker
should slide with him, quickly recover to his initial position, and be ready
to react to a kick-out by a guard, tackle, or near running back.
He should
keep his shoulders square, react to the pressure of the blocker, and give
ground
if necessary to come off a block (refer to diagram 5-22).
DIAGRAM 5^22
The linebacker should never let a tight end release from the line of
scrimmage to his inside without obstructing him.
If the tight end blocks
down, the linebacker should slide with him, recover to his initial position,
and be ready to react to a kick out block by a guard, tackle, or near running
back.
He should keep his shoulders square, react to the pressure of the
blocker, and give ground
if necessary to come off a block (refer to diagram
5-23).
29

DIA6RMIS-Z3
When the tight end releases for a pass, the linebacker should slide with
him and then react to the action of the quarterback (refer to diagram 5-24).
DIAGRAM »4
When aligned on the side of the formation that does not have a tight end,
the linebacker should key through the offensive tackle to the ball (refer to
diagram 5-25).
DIAGRAM S^2S

3.
Pass coverage responsibilities:
• Roll-out action toward the linebacker—rush with reckless abandon to the
quarterback (refer to diagram 5-26).
DIAGRAM M6
Straight drop back—cover the flat (refer to diagram 5-27).
DIAGRAM S^27
Action away from the linebacker—cover the deep seam, pivot to the inside
and come straight back (refer to diagram 5-28).
DIAGRAM S^ZS
31

Option responsibilities:
• Against the down the line option (no junction between the quarterback and
a running bacl<), the outside Nnebackers are responsible for the quarterback
(refer to diagram 5-29).

DIAGRAM »1
Split 6 (Roll to two deep zone defense coverage versus a drop back pass)
The responsibilities are the same for the linebackers as in rotate coverage, except
on a drop back pass the outside linebacker on the strong side of formation plays
curl, the inside linebacker on the strong side of formation plays middle, the
inside linebacker away from the strong side of formation plays the curl, and the
outside linebacker away from the strong side of formation plays the flat.
This
coverage makes
it possible to cover all five of the underneath pass zones
versus a drop back pass (refer to diagram 5-32).
ooo^

DIAGRAM 5-33
IV.
Split 6 Blitz Defense
The inside linebackers charge straight forward on the snap of the ball.
Although
they try to penetrate across the line of scrimmage,
they must read the play on
the run. As soon as they diagnose the play or get blocked, they should adjust
their course. The weak side outside linebacker should play #4 cautious man-for-
man against a pass, while the outside linebacker on the strong side of the
formation will either play #2 cautious man-for-man or curl versus a pass
depending on the coverage (refer to diagram 5-34).
DIAGRAM S^34
V.
Split 6 Blow Defense
The outside linebackers charge directly behind the buttocks of the offensive
tackles.
Against a normal tight end (one yard split), they should open step to
the inside and then come straight up the field.
If the split of the tight end
is
over one yard, they should charge directly to their penetration point.
If the split
is less than one yard, they should switch assignments with the defensive end
34

and step outside the end, move up field, and contain the bail carrier—the
defensive end should charge to the inside on this switch call.
Versus a split
end, the outside linebackers should aim for the nose of the offensive tackle
(refer to diagrams 5-35, 5-36a, 5-36b, 5-36c, 5-36d).
«1o

As soon as the outside linebackers diagnose the play or get blocked they should
adjust their course.
It is important that they go underneath (to the inside) the
offensive tackle trying to pass block them so that they do not interfere with the rush
lanes of the defensive tackle or the defensive end.
The inside linebackers play laterally against all runs and are responsible for the
quarterback against a hook-up option
(i.e., the quarterback fakes to one of the backs
before attacking the corner).
For all passes, the inside linebacker away from formation
plays #4 cautious man-for-man, and the inside linebacker on the side of the formation
plays #3 or curl depending on the coverage (refer to diagram 5-37).
lUUM S-37
Vi.
Split 6 Storm Defense
On the snap of the ball, both outside linebackers charge through the inside half
of a tight end
in a normal alignment.
The inside linebacker on the side of
formation blitzes, while the inside linebacker away from formation performs
barrel maneuver. On a barrel maneuver, the linebacker charges through the inside
half of the offensive tackle on the snap.
It is important to note that when he hits
the penetration point that his shoulders are square to the line of scrimmage (refer
to diagram 5-38).

How to Play Unebacker in Special Defenses
Once the basic defense has been learned,
it
is relatively easy to teach other defenses.
Each supplemental defense complements the basic defense, and all play a valuable
role within the total defensive package. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss a
few of the more commonly used supplemental defenses and to identify the techniques
and responsibilities of
linebackers who are playing
in these defenses.
I.
Four-four Rotate Defense
The secondary rotates to the side of the action (refer to diagram 6-1).

Once the basic defense has been learned,
it is relatively each to teach other defenses.

Line up slightly outside a tight end that is split two yards (refer to diagram
6-3).
DIAGRAM 6-3
When an offensive end
is split over two yards, all of the adjustments
become the same as those for the Split 6 (refer to diagram 6-4)
Against a tight wing (one that is split not wider than two yards), align
same as the Split 6 (refer to diagram 6-4).
DIAGRAM 64
39

In the case of a 3-yard split by a wingback, the outside linebacker should
line up two yards deep and nose up on the wingback (refer to diagram
6-5).

• Against a straight down-the-line option, play the pitch.
• Versus a "hood-up" option, play the quarterback to pitch.
Try to string out
the quarterback, make him pitch the ball, and then pursue at a proper angle
to the bail.
Pass Responsibility
Pass responsibility is the same as the Split 6 Rotate Defense except the
outside linebacker contains when the ball comes in his direction (refer to
diagram 6-7).

He plays
square into the center, reads his head, and rushes the passer once the
threat of a draw no longer exists. The other inside linebacker (referred
to as the Backer) should assume an alignment and adhere to the following
basic rules of play:
• Line up three yards deep and stack the offensive center.
• Key the ball and flow to the ball as required
in the Split 6 Rotate
Defense.
• Against a run action, he should play lateral to the offensive guard and
then pursue from inside to outside (refer to diagram 6-10).

Summary
Several possible defensive adjustments have been presented
in this section in order
to provide you with a better understanding of the multiplicity of defensive schemes
and responsibilities of linebackers in those schemes.
It is not necessary to use all of
these adjustments
in a game or during an entire season.
It
is your responsibility as
the coach to identify which defenses best meet your situational needs and best suit
your personnel.
Finally,
it
is critical that you take the appropriate steps to ensure
that every linebacker who plays for you knows and carries out his responsibilities on
every defensive scheme. The success of your team's defensive efforts are dependent
upon the ability of each player to properly execute his duties on every play from
scrimmage.

What Are the Fundamentals and Principles
off Defensive Play?
Coaches should always attempt to avoid misunderstandings and to be consistent in
their expectations regarding their players. One of the best ways to accomplish this
goal
is to develop a list of fundamentals and principles of defensive play. Many of
the most commonly accepted basic fundamentals have been passed down from one
successful coach to another.
Research, playing experience, common sense, and film
analysis have all played integral parts
in contributing new ideas.
After the proper
methods and techniques have been determined, the players should be drilled to
develop proficiency in the requisite skills and techniques.
It is very important to realize that many ways exist to develop skill proficiency in your
athletes.
By the same token, you should keep in mind that a fine line separates a
disciplined approach and making robots out of your players. We believe that the best
approach for developing linebackers
is one in which they are
trained to perform,
within certain parameters, with a high degree of recklessness.
In order to accomplish
this goal,
it is imperative that certain generic gridiron fundamentals—such as stance,
movement and tackling—must be developed before the techniques specific to position
play.
Stance and Movement
When
in the combat zone (i.e., close proximity to blockers, receivers, and/or ball
carriers),
it
is necessary for a defensive player to be
in a good hitting position.
The
appropriate position for each individual may vary slightly due to differences
in body
builds but a
list of general guidelines concerning what constitutes a proper stance
should include the following:
• His feet should be at least shoulder width apart or slightly wider.
• His toes should be pointed straight forward.
• The weight of his body should be on the toes and balls of his feet but his heels
should not be off the ground.
• His knees should be bent and positioned slightly beyond his feet.
• His legs should be tense (muscles contracted) and ready for sudden movement.
• The player should bend forward at the waist so that his head and chest are
positioned slightly beyond his knees.
• His hands should be positioned slightly outside the knee joint with his palms
facing inward and parallel to his leg.
• His neck should be bulled (i.e., tented) with his eyes looking up at the target.
• His upper body should be relaxed
in order to facilitate ease of movement but
should become tense immediately before contact.
ss

When moving
in the combat area, whether
it
is forward, lateral, or on an angle, the
defender should try to stay very close to the recommended hitting position—the arms
should move freely.
Having a proper stance becomes increasingly more important the
closer a defender is to the offensive players.
Defensive linemen must be able to take
off explosively yet make quick changes of direction as necessary. They must be able
to explode outwards (not up) off of both feet, get under blockers, and continue to
accelerate forward upon contact.
Linebackers must be able to move efficiently (i.e.,
not waste motion or effort) in all directions and not raise or lower themselves anymore
than necessary while moving.
All defenders should strive to be smooth, fluid-moving
athletes.
Among the recommended drills for developing the proper stance and movement
techniques
in players are the following:
• On Command Position
Drill — The defender practices getting into a good
hitting position.
• Stance Walk Drill — The defender walks
in a good hitting position (using
opposite hand-foot movement).
• Stance Run Drill — The defender runs in all directions in a good hitting position
(to get the feel of going as fast as possible yet under control).
• Move-Stop Drill — The defender moves
in various directions, then comes to a
stop
in a good hitting position, ready to play (sprint
- stop, lateral
- stop, etc.).
• Sprint-Gather Drill — The defender sprints forward at full speed, then gathers
himself, coming under control
in a good hitting position.
• Spring-Gather-Attack Drill — Same as sprint-gather drill except after the
defender has come under control, he veers off at approximately a 45° angle (in
good position) as
if attacking a ball carrier.
• Quarter-Eagle Drill — From a good position, the defender makes a quick 90°
turn. The defender should not hop, but turn as quickly as possible by pivoting
his entire body.
The drill should end with a full speed burst (i.e., the defender
turns right, turns back to the left, turns left, turns back to the right, and then
runs full speed right).
Defensive linemen should work on straight ahead starts, then start and make quick
changes of direction after one step (simulating down blocks, reach blocks, etc.).
Linebackers should slide and work on their footwork while simulating various blocking
schemes.
Defensive backs should retreat, then accelerate at the various angles that
a ball might be thrown.
The type of movement used by a defensive player
is determined to a great extent by
the requirements of his position. Among the recommended techniques for moving in
various directions are the following:
S6

Lateral Movement
The defender should not raise or lower himself from his initial stance.
He should
maintain his shoulders relatively parallel (or "square") to the line of scrimmage while
moving laterally.
The direction
in which a defender moves laterally is dictated by a
key or the ball.
The first basic lateral movement is the slide or the shuffle.
This
is the easiest
movement from which to change direction because a player's feet never cross.
Sometimes
it
is only necessary to slide once. A systematic analysis of lateral
movement shows that the defender leans
in the direction to which he wants to go,
slides his back foot (the one opposite the direction that he wants to go) in the
direction of the body lean, and then slides the lead foot in the direction that he
is
going.
It
is very important to note that he does not hop or cross his feet.
This
movement must be a quick move, with his feet remaining as close to the ground as
possible.
The defender's elbows should be kept close to his body. Any upper-body
motion should be minimized.
If play dictates, the defender continues to slide
in this
same manner.
If sliding
is not fast enough, then
it may become necessary to run laterally.
To run in
this manner, the defender should keep his shoulders square and allow his arms to
swing naturally.
Again, the defender leads with his back foot (the one opposite the
direction that he wants to go), but this time he crosses over the other foot (e.g.,
if
going to the
left,
it
is right over,
left out).
• The defender should turn his shoulders to run only as a last resort.
• The defender should not waste motion or become overextended.
• The defender may be able to enhance his movement quickness by performing
the skills required for his position with an all-out effort.
Everything should be
performed with a maximum effort, whether
it is one slide or a forty-yard spring-
any effort less than maximum can and often does become a bad habit.
Forward Movement
When a linebacker
is moving forward, he should employ the following techniques:
• The defender's toes should be pointed straight ahead.
• His weight should be on the balls of his feet.
• He should push (spring) off one foot, paw out with the other.
• As his foot comes down, the defender's body should move forward so that his
center of gravity is over his foot as
it touches.
• His hands and upper body should be relaxed, with his index finger and thumb
cupped. Some players may prefer to move their hands in a paddling-type
motion.
Regardless of how a player moves his hands, his hands and upper
body should be relaxed.
• The defender's elbows should remain close to his sides.
57

• He should employ his opposite hand
in an opposite-foot-movement pattern.
As his left foot goes forward, his right hand shoots upward to shoulder height
and left hand moves backward towards his hip.
• The defender should bend slightly, flexed (bent) at the waist, with his head
tilted slightly downward and his eyes directed straight ahead.
• The defender should try to move as smoothly and fluidly as possible (no wasted
motion).
•
Finally, the defender should concentrate on moving his feet as fast as possible.
Backward Movement
When the linebacker is moving backward, he should employ the following techniques:
• The defender should pump arms (similar to the way he does when he's
moving forward), employing the opposite hand with an opposite-foot-
movement pattern.
• He should push off the ball of one foot and paw back with the other foot.
• His upper body should be relaxed, his elbows
in, and all movements smooth
and fluid.
•
Finally, the defender should keep his knees flexed (bent) and lean forward
in
order to be in a position to be able to change directions quickly.
Shedding Blockers
In playing off blockers,
it is important to do only what is required to make a play. A
defender's primary objective should be to make tackles, not to destroy blockers.
It
is critical that the defender stay square, explode without unnecessary effort, after
contact be able to move before his offensive opponent (i.e., be the first to move after
contact)., react to the blocker's pressure, control the blocker, and come off the block
at an angle to meet the ball carrier (most of the time laterally).
In order to neutralize
a blocker charging above the waist, a defender should:
• Stay square with the blocker, not commit to a slide.
• Take a short step, then drive out and underneath the face mask of the blocker.
The defender should get underneath (vertical leverage) the blocker.
His hands
should be driven underneath the shoulder pads of the blocker. Upon contact,
he should lower his hip and buttocks so that his feet are underneath him.
• Not wind up or waste motion, but instead create maximum explosion with a
minimum amount of wasted effort — think of "stinging" the blocker.
• Not get overextended, but rather maintain a balanced position.
• Strain upward and into the pressure of the blocker while accelerating his feet
upon contact in short, choppy steps.
• Work to get his head up (his back should arch).
• Make an all-out effort to get rid of the blocker.
Push (press) and throw off the
offensive man.
Do not stay blocked! Come off the block laterally and quickly.
58

Among the additional points which should be emphasized regarding shedding blockers
are the following:
• The defender should prevent the blocker from getting a position between
himself and the ball carrier.
• The defender should never spin away from the blocker.
• The defender should strain into the pressure of the block, give ground, keep
his shoulders square, and take a proper pursuit angle,
if a blocker has managed
to position himself between the defender and the ball carrier.
• The defender should not go around the block through the 'back door" (i.e., the
'so-called" easy way).
If a blocker comes down from the outside or out from the inside (at an angle), the
defender should stay square and deliver a blow with his forearm and shoulder.
The
defender should not wind up, but instead make sure that he
is in a good hitting
position.
His lower arm should be flexed (bent) slightly and his elbow driven out from
his body. A defender's shoulder and forearm should be underneath the blocker. As
always, the defender should strain into the pressure of the blocker, accelerate his
feet, stay square, and be ready to give a step and instinctively come off the block at
the proper angle.
When a blocker attacks below the waist, the defender should:
• Concentrate on the blocker, while watching the ball carrier out of his periphery.
• React to the blocker's head, slide in the direction of his head, and strive to
maintain his position.
• Use his hands to stop the offensive man's charge. The defender's hands should
be directed
in the area of the offensive player's shoulder pads.
• Flex (bend) his knees, push with his hands, and give with his feet to clear the
offensive man's charge.
• Keep his shoulders square and make his second move before the offensive
man's charge.
•
If necessary, give ground to keep his shoulders square.
He should not go
around behind the blocker
if the offensive man has good position.
He should
keep moving in the direction that the offensive man
is trying to go.
• Be prepared. A good defender has the ability to side and coil at the same time
in order to be able to strike a blow (butt).
Tackling
An intense desire to excel, proper body position, and proper balance are essential
factors in consistently being able to demonstrate proper tackling techniques.
It is
recommended that when a defender is making a tackle he should:
• Not raise or lower himself from a good hitting position and stay square when
approaching the ball carrier.
• Keep his elbows close to his sides and not wind up.
S9

•
Bull (contract) his neck, keep his eyes open, and stay square to the ball carrier
upon contact.
• Accelerate his feet with short, choppy steps and wrap his arms around the ball
carrier upon contact. His hands should make contact in the area of his
opponent's buttocks then slide up as the ball carrier is taken back.
• Keep his head up, back arched, and always try to look at the ball carrier.
• Drive through the ball carrier, while trying to take him back five yards and put
him on his back.
• Drive his head
in front of a ball carrier that is coming at an angle (not straight
ahead) and then strain upward and into the ball carrier, always turning his
head into the ball carrier to look at him.
The defender should accelerate his
feet in the same manner as for a straight-ahead tackle.
• Keep his eyes open when assisting on a tackle so that he doesn't knock off the
other tackier.
• Spring from his stance and attempt to meet a ball carrier in the air who
is
diving to score a touchdown or get a first down.
•
In most instances, attack ball carriers in the open field — force the ball carrier
to make a decision.
• Use the sideline to his advantage when making a tackle by coming under
control, taking away the runner's inside cut, and forcing him out of bounds.
Pursuit
It
is important that defensive players approach ball carriers at the proper angles.
Using good judgment and taking the proper angle of pursuit can help to overcome the
comparative speed advantage which
is enjoyed by most offensive backs. When
pursuing a ball carrier, some important points for the defender to remember are:
• Inside defenders should try to keep everything on their outside shoulder when
the action comes to their side.
They should pursue in a lateral direction until the
ball carrier has turned upfield and then attack from the inside position.

When a ball carrier goes away from a defender, fie should maintain a position
slightly to the inside so that he can guard against the cutback.
DIAGRAM 7-2

Try not to
create a seam so that a back can run upfield.
' Take a steeper angle of pursuit (from the line of scrimmage) in order to save a
touchdown when the bail carrier is farther away.
DIAGRAM 7-3
61

When playing the quarterback against the option, pursuit should be at least at
a flat angle to intersect the ball carrier's path once the quarterback has pitched
the ball.
If the ball
is pitched well out in front of the quarterback,
it is necessary
to take a steeper angle (from the line of scrimmage) to meet the ball carrier.
DIAGRAM 7-4
Outside defenders (playing a flat zone) should attack flare and screen passes
from an outside position, attempting to force the ball carrier into the middle
of the field.
DIAGRAM 7 S
62

• Defenders should converge on plays to their inside from an outside-in-angle
(maintain a fence when aligned on the outside).
Pass Defense (Zone)
Defenders playing zone pass defense position themselves at a relative distance to
each other so that they can cover the areas of the field into which a quarterback
might want to throw the ball.
The linebacker's primary concern
is guarding an area
of the field between the defensive backfield and the line of scrimmage and reacting
to the look of a quarterback. A linebacker playing a zone must also be aware of the
positions of potential receivers who might be a threat to his area of responsibility.
The recommended techniques for a linebacker playing zone pass defense are:
• As soon as linebacker recognizes a pass play, he should call
it out and start
moving to his area of responsibility as fast as possible. Assuming a proper
depth initially gives him an opportunity to come under better body control
when the ball
is about to be thrown.
• Most of the time, he should turn and run laterally looking over his shoulder at
the quarterback.
• As he
is going to his zone area, he should glance for receivers who might be
coming into his area, but he should never turn completely away from the ball.
He should know where receivers are, yet still be able to react
if the quarterback
throws quickly into his area or another area.
• He should position himself between the ball and a potential receiver in his
zone. Once he has gotten within about three yards of the receiver, he should
settle down (stop in a basic hitting position) where he can see both the receiver
and the quarterback (match up with the receiver).
He should be turned at
approximately a 45° angle towards the outside, aligned three yards in front of
the receiver and three yards to his inside, concentrating on the ball but
watching the receiver out of his periphery, and being ready to react to any
throws at an angle that would allow him to
intercept the ball.
If the receiver
breaks to the inside behind the linebacker, he should pivot back to face the
ball and react to
it.
•
If no receiver is in his zone (twelve to fifteen yards deep), he should square
his shoulders to the line of scrimmage and begin to back pedal. While running
backwards, his weight should be on the balls of his feet, his arms should move
as
if running, and his elbows should be close to his sides. As he is retreating,
he should scan for receivers.
• He should react to all "looks" of the quarterback in his area. When the
quarterback looks, he should turn his shoulders and sprint at an angle to make
the interception in front of the receiver.
• He should try to catch the ball at its highest point, lock
it into his hands, should
"fire", and head toward the goal
line.
• All of the linebackers should communicate with each other. They should tell
the adjacent linebacker
if a receiver is crossing into his area.
63

•
If a receiver crosses a linebacker's path, he should be knocked to the ground
or at the very least off stride, but the linebacker should not get overextended
or ever go out of his way to hit a receiver. The linebacker should not lose his
position
in attempting to knock down a receiver.
• Once the ball
is thrown, all linebackers should be running at full speed toward
the ball until
it is either intercepted or batted to the ground.
Pass Defense (Man-For-Man)
Defenders playing man-for-man pass coverage should concentrate on the eligible
receivers and cover them wherever they might run. Two types of man-to-man pass
coverage techniques can be used. The linebacker can play reckless man-for-man
coverage when he has help in the deep secondary.
Reckless techniques are used to
take away the underneath passes (from the line of scrimmage to a depth of about
eighteen yards).
Cautious man-for-man techniques, on the other hand, are used when
the linebacker does not have any help in the deep zones, and must, therefore, protect
them. When playing cautious man-for-man pass defense, the linebacker:
• Aligns himself approximately one yard inside the offensive receiver at a depth
of about four yards with his inside foot forward.
• Concentrates on the receiver.
• Begins to run backward, leading with his front foot, as the receiver comes
forward.
• Tries to maintain a distance of two to three yards between himself and the
receiver and maintains a position of one yard to the receiver's inside. As the
receiver gets closer to him, he begins to run laterally In order to maintain his
position (refer to Insert 7-6).
• Breaks parallel to the receiver's changes of directions, and then gradually gets
closer to the receiver as the ball
is thrown.
• Must guard against any deep pass.
• Turns his back to the ball
in pursuit
if the receiver has gotten beyond him,
concentrates on the receiver, especially his hands; and turns toward the
quarterback to look for the ball when the receiver's hands come up.
DIAGRAM 7-6
64

When playing reckless man-for-man with two defensive halfbacks helping in the deep
outside zone, the linebacker:
• Aligns in the same manner as when playing cautious man-for-man pass defense.
• Concentrates on the receiver.
• Does not let the receiver go to his inside, jams him
if he tries to get inside
position.
•
If the receiver releases to the outside, waits (does not move) until the receiver
reaches his outside shoulder and then turns and jams him with his hands.
He
also lets the receiver get slightly ahead so that he can cover the underneath
passes.
• Chases the receiver, staying to the inside and slightly behind him (refer to Insert
7-7).
• Plays all pass cuts of the receiver from underneath (the side closest to the ball),
concentrates on the receiver's hands, and goes for the interception when the
receiver reaches for the ball.
DIAGRAM 77
Catching the Ball
Turnovers, specifically interceptions, can have a major impact on the final outcome
of a game.
For this reason,
it is important that linebackers spend ample practice time
catching thrown balls. Some of the steps that a player should do when receiving a
ball are:
• Concentrate on the ball.
• Look the ball into his hands.
• Do not attempt to run with or look away from the ball until
it
is firmly in his
hands.
6S

• Keep his hands "alert' but not too tense.
• Give with the ball as
it contacts his hands.
• Reach out with his hands and move toward the ball when going for an
interception.
• Put the ball away (i.e., tuck the point of one end of the ball under his arm
covering the other end with his palm and middle fingers).
• Keep his thumbs pointed to the inside
if the ball
is thrown above his waist.
• Keep his thumbs pointed to the outside
if the ball
is thrown below his waist.
• Should yell
"fire" or some other word to let his teammates know that the ball
has been intercepted.
Blitzing
Blitzing can be an effective maneuver to change the normal pattern of linebacker
play. When blitzing, the linebacker attacks an offensive area on the snap of the ball.
Blitzing
is used as an adjustment in an attempt to change the tempo of play, to create
a long yardage situation for the offense, or to break the continuity of an offensive
drive, to rush the passer — especially
if certain blitzes take advantage of an offense's
pass-blocking scheme.
It
is also possible to disrupt blocking assignments or stop
certain running plays by blitzing. When blitzing the linebacker should:
• Not alarm the offense by altering his stance or starting too soon.
• Go immediately on the snap of the ball.
• Attempt to penetrate across the line of scrimmage.
• Notice the offensive linemen and the action of the ball and adjust as they are
moving (inside linebackers should follow pulling guards, etc.).
• Stay under control.
• React to the pressure of blocks as
if he were playing normally.
• Use his hands when rushing the passer (refer to section on Pass Rush).
• Try to get the offensive man turned one way and then go
in the opposite
direction.
• Not dive (leave his feet) to make a tackle except as a last resort.
• Use his hands when playing lead blockers in the open field where the ball
carrier has plenty of running room.
• Try to make the blocker miss or give ground in order to save the touchdown.
• Not become impatient or attempt to make every tackle for a loss of yardage.
• Give ground around piles of blockers and defenders in order to make plays for
a two- or three-yard gain instead of creating potential "big plays."
Pass Rush
The ability to rush a passer is predominantly innate, but several general coaching
points exist that have been learned over the years through trial and error, including
the following:
• Get a great jump on the football.
Anticipate, know the situation, study the
stances of the opponents.
• Get on a corner
if possible.
66

Be offensive, attack.
Get the offensive player into an awkward body position.
Cause him to move either laterally or forward.
Get the blocker turned or
overextended.
Outside linebackers should establish a speed rush, while inside players should
develop a bull rush.
• Do not get hooked up with the blocker.
Strive to keep their hands off of you
by slapping, pushing, etc.
Use quick fakes, then move upfield.
' Operate with your elbows close to your body; your hands should be positioned
inside the hands of your opponent.
• Have a sense of timing. Know when your opponent is off balance, when to
push or pull and accelerate by the defender.
> Use the arm-under or over techniques, whichever one is appropriate depending
upon your height.
Develop a counter move off of your best move (e.g.,
immediately follow an arm-under move with a "club" maneuver).
• Keep moving upfield, maintain constant pressure on the quarterback.
• Get your hands up when the quarterback is ready to throw the ball.
Have a
sense of timing, know when to raise your hands.
Do not leave your feet until
the ball
is released.
• Maintain relative position to your teammates who are also rushmg.
Develop
a feel for one another during a dropback pass.
• Recognize the blocking direction and react to the pressure of the block.
• Take care of the immediate problems first.
• Learn to concentrate on blockers while seeing ball carriers out of his periphery.
• Not waste motion and effort.
• Have a sense of timing and know when to exert himself.
• Not be a "robof or afraid to take a chance in order to make things happen.

Drills— Individual
Through individual drills a linebacker can be instructed in and given the opportunity
to practice the fundamentals and principles of proper play.
All linebackers should be
drilled in these fundamentals so that they are able to develop proper, game-like
habits. A v\/ell-organized drill can provide the basic foundation for a good performance.
All drills should be well-planned by you before going to the practice field.
Before
practice starts, you should:
• Make a checklist of all of the situations which might occur during a game and
make sure that you have designed appropriate drills for improving such areas.
• Understand and clearly define the purpose of every drill.
• Evaluate each drill as to whether
it is serving
its intended purpose; consult
with the players to see what benefits they believe that they are getting out of
the drills.
• Devise or emphasize certain drills to address particular problems your players
may have or your opponents may present.
• Organize the time allotted for individual
skill improvement drills so that the
most important objectives are reached.
• Organize the drills according to the number of players involved and the space
available.
• Make sure that the necessary equipment for the drills
is in the proper place on
the field prior to the start of practice.
• Fully explain the drill,
its purpose, and the planned rotation before you have
your players attempt
it.
Once practice begins all the drills should move quickly.
The tempo should be quick.
Everything should be done with a maximum effort — just as
if
it were an actual game
setting.
Structure your drills so that very little standing around occurs.
It is usually
a good practice to avoia staying on one drill too long.
If a player executes the
fundamental correctly once,
it should be sufficient.
You should guard against
monotony as much as possible and attempt to
instill competition between players
whenever possible.
You should also indicate the proper techniques to the players;
showing them the drill once and have them do
it as many times as necessary— if a
drill
is not done correctly,
it should be repeated.
It is important, however, not to slow
everyone down for the sake of one person.
If a player repeatedly performs a drill
incorrectly, he should receive individual instruction at a different time.
Movement Drills
All drills should begin with the linebacker(s) in a proper stance.
If more than one
linebacker is involved, a command of "break" should be used to get them into their
69

stance. Some of the typical drills that we have used at Penn State to develop a
number of highly successful linebackers include the following:
• Lateral Start Drill (one slide) — The purpose of this drill
is to teach linebackers
the proper techniques for initiating lateral movement.
DIAGRAM 81
The coach has the linebackers stand in a straight line facing him. With a hand signal,
the coach directs them to slide once in the direction that he points and then come to
a complete stop, while maintaining their stance.
He then repeats a signal for them
to move one slide
in the same or opposite direction.
After a number of slides, the
coach points straight ahead and the players turn and run full speed in a straight line
for a distance of five yards looking back over their shoulder at the coach.
• Continual Sliding Drill (shuffling) — The purpose of this drill
is to teach
linebackers the proper techniques for sustaining lateral movement.
DIAGRAM 82
70

The drill
is organized in the same manner as the lateral start drill.
The difference
between the drills
is that when the coach signals to one side, the players continue
to slide in that direction until the coach gives them a signal to stop (all while
maintaining a good stance).
The coach then gives a signal to slide in the opposite
direction.
After a number of direction changes, the coach signals, and the players
sprint in the same manner as the conclusion of the lateral start drill.
• Lateral Run Drill (crossover) — The purpose of this drill
is to teach
linebackers
the proper techniques for running laterally.
DIAGUUI 83
The drill
is organized and run in the same manner as the continual sliding drill, except
the linebacker runs laterally, keeping his shoulders square, instead of sliding.
• Mirror Crossfield Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to train linebackers to
mirror a ball carrier by moving laterally at an appropriately relative distance.

DIAGIUUII84
71

The drill starts with a ball carrier (leader) who walks or sprints in a straight line,
changing from one speed to another.
He should stay at one speed for at least five
yards. When the leader gets to a marker (twenty-five to thirty yards away), he steps
forward to either side. The linebacker mirrors the leader by sliding or running laterally,
staying slightly behind him, and maintaining the same distance between them
(approximately two yards).
He stays lateral until the ball carrier turns up, and then
tackles him.
If done without pads, the drill
is ended with a "push-acceleration".
• Change of Direction Race Drills — The purpose of these drills
is to evaluate
and improve a linebacker's ability to quickly change direction.
DIAGRAM 8-S
Lateral race
- The linebackers stand facing the coach with their near foot on a
line.
On a hand signal from coach, they run laterally, keeping their shoulders
square to the coach until they touch or cross a line five yards five times (a total
distance of twenty-five yards). They then repeat the drill facing
in the opposite
direction.
Forward-backward race
- The linebackers stand with both feet behind the line
and shoulders parallel to the line.
On a signal from the coach, they sprint
forward five yards until they touch or cross the next line.
Then, they run
backwards to the starting line and repeat until they have gone five times (a
total of twenty-five yards).
Around-the-Bag
Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to develop a linebacker's
quickness and teach him to strain into pressure without becoming overextended
and to recover by making a second effort.
72

DIAGRAM 8Hi
A ball carrier (leader) stands at one end of a long bag that is lying on the ground,
while the linebacker stands at the other end and faces the leader
The leader comes
forward on one side of the bag and steps into the linebacker The defender reacts by
coming forward on that side of the bag and pushes the leader back a short distance,
maintaining his head high with his buttocks lowered to prevent over extension, his
back arched, and his feet accelerating with short, choppy steps.
Both men recover
and race to the other side of the bag and repeat the same procedure.
On the last
contact (usually the third), the defender strains and pushes the leader back beyond
the bag.
• Lateral Fill-Around-The-Bags
Drill — The purpose of this drill
is the same as
that of the "around the bag"
drill.
DIAGRAM 87
Four or more bags are placed on the ground so that they are parallel to each other
The drill
is executed
in the same manner as the around-the-bag drill except that after
each contact, both the ball carrier (leader) and the defender continue on to the next
alley. The defender pushes the leader back after they have gone around the last bag.
73

Diamond Mirror Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to develop the ability to
move backwards and laterally change directions on both the signal of a coach
and the action of an opponent.
DIA6iUW84
To begin the drill, the linebackers position themselves as diagrammed, facing the
coach.
The coach first signals the closest defender to run backwards in a straight
line, laterally at forty-five degree angles, or forward
in a straight line.
The other
three linebackers do what the first man does, trying to maintain the same distance
between each other. On the final signal, everyone sprints full speed to the coach.
• Score Drill (Mirror Dodge) — The purpose of this drill
is to develop quickness,
sliding ability, and the ability to react to an offensive player without becoming
overextended.
It also provides an excellent tool to evaluate the movement
ability of a defender.
DIA6UII84
74

The ball carrier (leader) stands about three to four yards from a line between two
long bags lying on the ground.
He attempts to cross the line between the two bags
as fast as possible by moving laterally and faking the defender who
is mirroring him.
As soon as he crosses the line, he returns to the starting position and tries to score
(by crossing the lines untouched) as many times as possible in a given time limit,
usually fifteen to twenty seconds. The defender slides to stay in front of the leader
trying to prevent him from scoring.
He may use his hands but the emphasis
is on
moving the feet and not being overextended.
To emphasize the importance of moving
the feet, the drill
is done occasionally with the defender putting his hands behind his
back.
Tackling Drills
• Form Tackling Drills (versus a player or a sled) — The purpose of form tackling
drills
is to teach the proper form
in making a tackle.
Fit
- the defender is fitted into the sled (or ball carrier) in the proper contact
position. The position that he should end up
in upon making contact with the
ball carrier.
Fit and follow through
- from the fitted position the defender drives through
the sled (or ball carrier) wrapping his arms, keeping his head up, and
accelerating his feet.
The tackle
- starting from a good hitting position about three yards away from
the sled (or ball carrier), the defender fires into the sled, makes the tackle, and
follows through as described.
• Score Tackling Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to force the linebacker to
move and change directions before making a tackle.
L
B
DUGRAM 810
7S

Three to five bags are positioned on the ground parallel to each other about two yards
apart. The ball carrier and defender align on opposite sides of the middle bag. The
ball carrier runs back and forth between the outside bags and tries to fake the
defender.
On the command "score", the ball carrier runs straight up the nearest alley.
When the command
is given, he tries to get across the front edge of the bags.
The
defender mirrors the ball carrier and attempts to tackle the ball carrier and drive him
back before he crosses the front edge of the bags.
• Attack-A-Bag Drill — Similar to the "score tackling drill," the purpose of this
drill
is to force the linebacker to move and change directions before making a
tackle.
DIAGRAM 8-11
Two bags are positioned about eight yards apart with a coach (player) standing
in the
middle of the bags. A defender is positioned 10-12 yards away from the bags. The
defender moves forward as fast as possible yet in a good position. When he reaches
a point approximately five yards from the bags, the coach steps to one side or the
other. The defender then angles toward that bag, drives his head across
in front,
turns into the bag, picks
it up, and takes
it back five yards. When practicing without
pads tackling
is simulated with a push-acceleration (the defender places both hands
under the leader's shoulders, with his head up, back arched, and feet moving
in short,
choppy steps).
Drills on Shedding Blockers
The purpose of these drills
is to practice and develop the techniques involved in
shedding blockers.
• Simulated Blow vs. Air Drill — Hit, accelerate feet, strain, get off the block.
(Straighten, angle, etc.)
• Slide-Butt Drill — Slide as
if reacting to a blocker then pop as
if striking a
blow.
Slide-Pop, Slide-Pop Drill — Do not cross over.
76

• Slide-Push-Give Drill — Simulate playing off a low block by sliding, pushing,
and giving (all
in one synchronized movement).
Use a sled,
if available.
Combination Drills
• Dive Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to have a linebacker learn to play off
various types of blocks and make a tackle.
DIAGRAM 8-12
Two bags are laid on the ground parallel to each other approximately five yards apart.
An offensive blocker
is positioned between the bags with a ball carrier about five
yards directly behind him. The linebacker aligns facing the blocker. The coach signals
for the blocker either to fire straight ahead or to execute a low block to one side.
If
the coach points straight ahead, the ball carrier goes to either side of the blocker but
stays inside the bag.
The offensive blocker then gets involved
in the drill.
The
linebacker plays off the block and makes a tackle.
• Two-man Dive Drill — The purpose of the drill
is the same as that of the dive
drill, with the exception that more people are involved.

DIAGRAM 813
77

The drill
is organized in the same way as the dive drill, except two bags are positioned
about three yards outside the other bags, and that there are two blockers and two
linebackers involved. The coach signals the type of blocks (same as in dive drill) and
the starting count. The coach calls the starting signals.
If the blockers go straight
ahead, the ball carrier runs forward and must stay within the inside bags.
If the
blockers position block to one side, the ball carrier goes between the two outside
bags in that direction. The linebackers play the blocks and make the tackle whichever
way the ball carrier chooses to run.
• Three-On-One Key Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to have the linebacker
react to a key, play off various types of blocks, and make a tackle.
DIAGRAM 8-14
Two bags are laid on the ground parallel to each other and about seven yards apart.
Three offensive blockers are positioned alongside each other, between the bags, and
in a three- or four-point stance. A ball carrier aligns himself approximately five yards
behind the middle blocker and the linebacker starts opposite the middle blocker
The
coach signals to one of the blockers and initiates the action with the command "go."
If he points to one of the outside blockers, they come at an angle and block the
linebacker above the waist. The ball carrier breaks
in that direction and stays inside
the bags.
The linebacker slides, plays the block, and makes the tackle.
If the coach
points to the middle blocker, he also gives him a direction.
On command, the blocker
tries to gain position on that side and blocks below the waist.
The bail carrier goes
to that side and runs between the bag and the outside blocker. The linebacker plays
the block and makes the tackle.
• Inside Linebacker Key Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to force an inside
linebacker to play off blocks and make a tackle after moving laterally.
78

DIAGUUI 8 IS
Three bags are laid on the ground parallel to each other, about three yards apart. A
blocker is positioned
in each of the two alleys in a three- or four-point stance. A ball
carrier is positioned about three yards on the opposite side of the middle bag. The
coach signals to one side and initiates the action with the command "go."
On the
command, the ball carrier starts to the signaled side and the blocker comes forward
and high blocks the linebacker. The ball carrier breaks anywhere between the two
bags. The linebacker slides in the direction of the ball carrier, plays the block, and
makes the tackle.
• Deiiver-A-Blow Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to develop "shock" when
delivering a blow, to react to blockers at different angles, and to come off
blocks properly.
DIAGRAM 8-1
B
Three offensive blockers are aligned alongside each other with a distance of about
one and one-half yards between each man. A ball carrier
is positioned about five
yards behind the middle blocker, and the linebacker aligns across from the middle
blocker and faces him. The coach points to one of the blockers and the designated
man blocks the linebacker above the waist.
The linebacker reacts to square up on
the blocker and delivers a blow.
After contact, both players recover to the starting
positions as quickly as possible.
The coach then points to another blocker and the
79

drill continues.
To conclude the drill, the coach raises his hand to one side.
On this
signal, the ball carrier goes
in that direction, while the blocker on that side fires out.
The linebacker plays the block and then makes the tackle.
Pass Defense Drills
• Catching Drills — The primary purpose of these drills
is to develop and improve
a linebacker's ability to catch the football.
One-hand-catch — The coach and linebacker face each other at varying
distances (seven to twelve yards).
The ball
is thrown to a point above the
linebacker's head, where he must catch
it with one hand.
Two-hand-catch — The coach and linebacker face each other at a distance
between seven and twenty yards.
The ball
is thrown to the linebacker so that
he must catch
it with his hands in various positions.
Step-forward catch — The ball
is thrown to the linebacker in the same manner
as the two-hand catch, but the linebacker now comes one or two steps forward
to catch the ball at the highest possible point.
Look — The linebacker stands with his back to the coach at a distance of about
ten yards.
On the command, "look," the linebacker turns completely around to
face the coach, and the ball
is thrown.
The linebacker steps forward to catch
the ball at the highest possible point.
Concentration — Two players are positioned
in front of a linebacker.
All of the
players face the coach at a distance of approximately ten yards.
As the ball
is thrown, the two players wave their hands in front of the linebacker but do
not touch the ball. The linebacker concentrates and catches the ball.
Angle interception — Some type of object is placed on the ground at a distance
of about seven yards from the linebackers and ten yards from the coach. The
linebackers are positioned beyond the object so that they must come forw/ard
at various angles to catch the ball.
On the signal the linebacker runs towards
the marker, the ball
is thrown, and the catch
is made in front of the marker.

DIAGRAM 8 17
Semi-Circle Peripheral Vision Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to emphasize
quick hands, concentration, peripheral vision, and to have fun.
DIAGRAM 818
The other players form a semi-circle around a designated linebacker. The designated
player and the first man
in the semi-circle both have footballs.
As soon as the
designated player passes the ball to the second man, the first player passes the ball
to him.
This pattern continues around the semi-circle and back to the beginning.
• Match-Up, Zone Drills (A receiver has threatened a linebacker's zone from the
outside). ball from a terminal position which the linebacker would have
if his
zone had been threatened.
81

J
»--c>
DIAGBAM8-I9
The linebacker looks at the coach and assumes a position with his feet at
approximately a 45° angle to the coach. The distance between them
is approximately
ten yards.
On the coach's "look", the linebacker breaks to intercept the ball (pivots
back to face the ball or just breaks), shouts "fire," and sprints toward the coach for a
distance of five yards.
• Terminal Mirror Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the linebacker
his proper position
in relation to a receiver in his zone and to have him
anticipate making an interception.
3 yards

DIAGRAM 8 21
The procedure
is the same as for the terminal mirror drill, except that the linebacker
aligns himself seven yards from the coach and runs laterally back to the terminal
position.
• Lateral Retreat-To-The-Pattern Drill — The purpose of this drill
is for the
linebacker to develop the ability to retreat to an area, read the offensive
pattern and the ball, and make an interception.

The coach and linebacker line up as they did
in the lateral retreat mirror drill and a
receiver is positioned about eight to ten yards outside the linebacker
On command,
the receiver runs straight down the field about twelve to fifteen yards and breaks
in
or out. The coach throws the ball on the receiver's break. The linebacker retreats to
his terminal position, makes the interception, shouts "fire," and sprints five yards
forward at full speed.
• True Zone Drills (a receiver is not threatening the linebacker's zone).
Terminal back pedal — The purpose of this drill
is to learn to back pedal
properly and break on the ball at a proper angle to make the interception.
DIAGRAM 8-23
Two bags are positioned upright approximately fourteen yards apart and twenty yards
from the coach. A linebacker lines up three yards
in front of the bags, midway
between the two bags, and facing the coach. On a signal the linebacker back pedals
until the coach looks at one of the bags. When the coach looks, the linebacker turns
his shoulders and sprints at an angle to make the interception
in front of the bag.
After the ball
is caught, the linebacker shouts "fire" and sprints forward for five yards.
• Lateral Retreat and Back Pedal Drill — The purpose of this drill
is the same as
the terminal back pedal
drill, except the linebacker must now retreat to his
zone.
84

DIAGRAM 8-24
The bags are positioned in the same places as in the terminal back pedal drill. The
coach aligns in front of one of the bags at a distance of twenty yards, while the
linebacker
is seven yards in front of the coach.
On a signal the linebacker runs
laterally to the terminal spot (twelve yards deep and midway between the bags) and
from that point everything
is the same as the terminal back pedal.
• Two-Man Tip Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to ensure that the linebacker
continues to pursue the ball until
it hits the ground.
DIAGRAM 8 2S
8S

Two bags are positioned upright and eighteen yards apart. The coach stands midway
between the bags and about twenty yards away from them. Two linebackers line up
alongside each other, and face the coach—approximately seven yards from him. On
a signal, each linebacker retreats to the bag on his side. The ball
is then thrown to
one of the linebackers when he reaches the bag, and he tips the ball into the air. The
other linebacker sprints to the ball and catches
it at the highest possible point.
Both
linebackers then sprint full speed to the coach.
• One-On-One Coverage Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to cover a receiver
man-for-man, both cautiously and aggressively.
The linebacker covers a receiver all over the field using either cautious or aggressive
man-for-man techniques.
Fumble Recovery
• Form Recovery Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the proper method of
falling on a loose football.
A ball
is placed three to four yards in front of a linebacker. On command, the linebacker
dives forward and reaches out to the ball.
On contact, the linebacker pulls the ball to
his stomach and curls around the ball, lying on his side to protect himself.
• Competitive Recovery Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the
linebackers to fight for a loose ball.
Two linebackers line up alongside each other.
On command, the linebackers fall
forward, touch their chests to the ground, and scramble after a ball that has been
thrown between them.
86

Drills— Group and Team
Football
is a team game, requiring individuals to practice
in groups or as a team.
In
order to be successful, players must learn to function as a cohesive unit, working
together and anticipating each other's reactions.
Group and team drills are designed
to create game-like situations that enable individuals to develop proficiency at
selected skills and techniques, while fostering group cohesion.
The preparation for all of the group and team drills begins off the field.
Coaches
should coordinate their efforts.
If several coaches are involved in a drill, they should
identify the objectives they want to achieve and what role each individual coach must
undertake
if the drill
is to be conducted properly. The coaches should also make sure
that they are not duplicating something that has already been covered
in another drill
or activity.
If a scout team
is running plays from cards, every play should be drawn exactly the
way
it is anticipated the opponents will run the play. The opponent's plays that must
be stopped should be run against all the defensive schemes—especially the defenses
which are most vulnerable to those plays. The plays should be listed
in sequence
with the hash mark, formation, and the down and distance of each play recorded.
The person responsible for running the plays should have all this information.
During group and team drills,
it is also important to emphasize basic fundamentals
such as stance and proper techniques.
Quickness, hustle, second effort, getting off
the ground, and going after loose balls should also be emphasized. The necessary to
develop good habits should be emphasized at all times.
For instance, even
if the ball
carriers are not to be taken to the ground,
it
is
still important for the linebacker to
accelerate his feet and take the ball carrier back.
Everyone should get to the ball by
taking the proper lane of pursuit.
During pass drills, a coach should check to see
if a receiver could have been knocked
to the ground, whether everyone
is going to the football, and
if the defensive team
turns to offense once an interception has been made.
Aggressiveness (trying to make
a big play) should be emphasized
in all drills.
Every drill should have a primary
purpose (defend outside runs, etc.).
"Surprise" plays (a deep pass, etc.) should be run
occasionally to keep the defense alert.
Group Pass Defense Drills
In our defensive scheme, five underneath zones are defined.
If the ball
is in the
middle of the field, the flats are seven yards from the sideline and twelve yards deep.
87

The middle zone
is
in the middle of the field and
is fifteen yards deep. The curls are
one yard inside the hash (toward the middle) and are twelve to fifteen yards deep.
For every two yards that the ball moves, the zone moves one yard
in the same
direction.
The flat zone, however,
is never closer than four yards to the sideline or
farther than nine yards from the sideline. The curls are never farther than three yards
on either side of the hash mark. The middle zone
is never closer than five yards to
either hash mark.
Linebackers should be reminded that the farther they have to go
to their pass zone, the more concerned they should be with width and less concerned
with depth.
Various drills have been devised to develop the necessary skills to play
good pass defense.
• Zone Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to define the five underneath pass
zones in relation to the ball and the field and have the linebackers retreat to
those areas.

while the linebackers retreat to their proper zones.
On the coach's signal, they stop.
Each linebacker's position
is checked; then the ball
is moved to another spot on the

• Goal-Line Pass Skeleton — The purpose of this drill
is to defend against
anticipated goal-line passes and to give the linebackers a feel for playing
pass defense inside the ten-yard line.
DIAGRAM 9^7
Offensive backs and receivers run patterns against those linebackers involved in goal-
line pass coverage. The plays are run from the ten-yard line to the goal-line, in
sequence, off cards, and against pre-determined defenses.
91

Goal-Line Corner Run Support Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the
proper run support techniques against outside runs
in a goal-line situation.
o

Pursuit
• Skeleton Pursuit Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to teach the linebackers
the proper angles of pursuit and of convergence on the ball.
The coach or quarterback, two running backs, and two wide receivers run three plays
at the linebackers.
Each play is first walked through, including the defensive pursuit
lanes, then
is run at full speed. The first play
is a simple down-the-line option where
the quarterback comes along the line of scrimmage and pitches the ball to the nearer
back.
The ball carrier runs for the sideline, then turns toward the goal-line.
All
linebackers must take the proper lane of pursuit and touch the ball carrier.
Next, the
quarterback drops back and throws a flare pass to one of the backs.
The ball carrier
heads for the goal-line, and the linebackers converge and touch him.
Finally, the
quarterback throws the ball out to one of the wide receivers, and the linebackers
pursue and touch the runner.
DIAGRAM 9-10
Special Problems
If an opponent's offense presents a special dilemma to the defense, a drill can be
organized to emphasize some of their best plays.
It might be an option period, an
inside running period, a period for screens and delays, or other types of passes, etc.
Teamwork
• Thud
Drill — The purpose of this drill
is to present game situations to the
linebackers and condition them to the tempo of the game.
93

This practice period involves an entire offensive and defensive team. The plays are
run off cards,
in sequence, from different positions on the field, and against pre-
determined defenses. The down and distance
is called out for every play, and the
ball
is moved down the field.
The plays are run quickly, and everyone must hustle
in
and out of the huddle.
The blocking
is full speed, but the ball carrier is not taken to
the ground.
Special situations such as "get the ball back" defense and "two minutes
to go" defense are practiced during this period.
One sequence usually comprises ten
to fourteen plays.
94

How to Keep Your Players' Minds in the Game
While
it is important to practice well, a team must also perform well. Many players
respond differently in a game situation; some rise to the occasion, while others seem
to become too nervous to function
effectively.
Still others enjoy the thrill of a crowd
and play much better than expected.
Most great players have uncanny timing and
natural instincts for the "big play."
Because
it appears that the majority of these
characteristics are primarily innate, the coach has little or no control over them.
It
is important, however, that coaches and players talk as much as possible about
each game situation and the
little things that might make the difference between
success and failure.
First,
it is necessary that the players be able to recognize the
most common plays that will be run by their opponent and understand the blocking
schemes that go with those plays.
Next
, the players should be able to recognize
offensive formations and backfield sets and know the characteristics of each.
Finally,
the players should be aware of down and distance situations, offensive strategy, big
plays, field position, and critical situations.
The Opponent's Basic Plays
As a general rule, each of your opponents will exhibit certain offensive tendencies.
Accordingly, each of these teams has specific plays that
it tends to run
in particular
situations.
These plays should be identified and defined so that everyone has a
thorough understanding of these plays. A few of the offensive plays which are
relatively popular (and commonly used) in high school and college football are
illustrated in diagrams 10-1
to 10-6.
Most great players have uncanny timing
and natural instincts for the "big play.

Understanding Offensive Formations
Linebackers should be alert to a team's offensive tendencies. Most teams will run
only certain plays from a particular formation.
Because each formation creates a
unique problem, a linebacker should be able to adjust more quickly and anticipate
better
if he can recognize the formation and its basic characteristics. The linebacker
should anticipate but not guess.
Inside linebackers should always call out the strength of the formation and the type
of backfield set, for example, "Flanker left, 1° backs".
Examples of several of the most
common backfield sets and their characteristics include the following:
• 1" backs
DUfiRiW 1fr7
Features:
-
Basically, this formation facilitates a tailback-oriented offense.
It enables the
tailback to hit quickly in a lot of different holes.
-
It facilitates a strong outside running game to either side (options, sweeps,
etc.).
- Most teams use play action passes or challenge the perimeter with the run-
pass option.
- Other basic plays include the sprint draw, isolation, off tackle, buck, veer,
veer option, and passes off those plays.
102

• -T" backs — the halfback is set away from the strength of the formation.
DIAGRAM IM
^^^^strongest running play is the "belly" to the side of the "set" halfback.
- The set halfback (number two) is more of a pass threat.

Game Situations
Linebackers should be aware of many different situations which arise during a game.
They should be alert and flexible, and able to rapidly adjust their play. While each
team has its own personality, several general guidelines exist which linebackers
should adhere to during a game:
• Anticipate run or pass and adjust your alignment in the obvious situation.
• Anticipate, but do not guess; big defensive plays come about by recognition
and going full speed on every play.
• Do not let your opponent out of the defense's four-down area (i.e., keep them
inside their thirty-five yard line).
• Come up with a "big play" between the thirty-five yard lines.
Try not to let
them get into their four-down area with ease.
• Realize that once your opponent crosses your thirty-five yard line, he is in four-
down territory.
Most teams will use their most consistent plays and stay patient; the closer
that they get to the goal-line, the tougher
it gets to make yardage.
Near the
goal-line, the defense has less area to defend against the pass and as a result
can, play more aggressively against the run.
• Know the score and the amount of time remaining.
110

Many games are won or lost in the last two minutes. The following factors are
important to remember when trying to prevent a score:
• Be aware of what
it will take for the opponent to win (a touchdown or a field
goal).
• The outside linebackers should go out on the wide receivers
if they are playing
the flat zone.
Inside linebackers should deepen.
• The outside linebackers should think of covering square outs and quick outs.
• Everyone should attempt to keep the ball carrier in the field of play.
• Stay alert for a quick line-up. Some opponents will align quickly after a first
down. A few might even run two or three plays without huddling.
• Realize that the clock
is stopped after a first down until the chains have been
moved.
• Don't panic!
Equally important, don't give the appearance of losing your
composure.
The opposite situation arises when the defense must get the ball back in order to
win.
In this situation the defensive players should:
• Try to make a "big play."
Don't panic, however, and start playing a "helter-
skelter" type defense.
• Keep their poise and stay together.
• Get off pile ups quickly and move into/out of the huddle rapidly.
• Know how many time-outs that their team has left and be ready to utilize them
wisely. The offense can stop the clock without calling "time-out."
• Realize that the clock stops in certain situations (e.g., when a pass
is
incomplete, the ball carrier goes out of bounds, or the ball changes hands). A
defensive team must not "waste" a "time-out" (i.e., call) in these situations.

How to Prepare for the Moment of Truth— Game Week
For most teams, preparation for a Friday or Saturday game begins the day after the
preceding game.
All team situations are different however.
Various coaching staffs
have their own methods of preparations.
Certain items, however,
should not be
overlooked. The basic day-to-day responsibilities of the linebacker coach during the
week of the game are outlined as follows:
Sunday

• A list of the opponent's strengths
is developed.
• Charts of the opponent's running plays with the exact blocking schemes are
prepared.
• Charts of the underneath pass plays with the exact breaking points of the
primary receivers are drawn.
• Notes are made of any special problems, things to emphasize, and adjustments
that might be considered.
• The films of Saturday's game are reviewed.
• The linebackers are shown one or two reels of film of their upcoming opponent.

offense. Talk about the expected plays and offensive attack. Call out a defense
and point out the reaction that the linebacker should make to a certain play
when
in that defense.
• Point out any tips that might be helpful to the linebackers.
Wednesday
• Organize for practice.
• Discuss all of the problems that have to come to light on the practice field.

in the game to include the
strengths of each defense and the reasons for using them.
(Refer to Example
4).
• A down and distance chart is prepared for the game.
This chart includes all of
the defenses and a place to record on which down the defenses are used
during the game.
(Refer to Example 5).
• Each linebacker should pre-play the game mentally to think of how he will
react to some of the problems which might arise during the game.
• A thorough review session
is held with the linebackers.

How to Deal With the Moment of Truth— Game Day
The basic alignment in the Penn State multiple defensive scheme
is the Split 6.
The
numerous variations of the Split 6 Defense and the role that linebackers play in these
defenses are outlined as follows:Game day
is the players' day. A coach's duties on
game day will vary from one staff to another.
However, some common responsibilities
pertaining to the linebackers exist.
Essentially, the linebacker coach should make
himself available should any problems arise.
He should answer all questions that the
players might have.
Occasionally, he may remind them of some specific points to
remember but will do so without causing any confusion or uncertainty (remember:
do not "overcoach").
Every coach approaches each game slightly differently.
In
general, however,
all coaches should make certain that their players are alert without
being tense. The basic objective
is to make each player feel as though he
is well-
prepared and ready to make an all-out effort, regardless of who his opponent might
be.
One of the responsibilities of the linebacker coach
is to "warm up" the linebackers.
It is important that the players begin to "sweat" and prepare themselves both
physically and mentally for the upcoming contest.
In most situations, the various phases
of the warm-up period for linebackers involve the following steps:
• Stretch as a team.
• Eive or six minutes of pass defense drill:
- terminal back pedal.
-
lateral start.
- angle interception.
• r\/lovement drills:
-
lateral start.
- continual sliding.
-
lateral run.
• Work with a partner:
- low blocks.
- bounce the shoulders.
- form tackles.
• Deliver the blow drill.
• Fumble recovery drill.
Once the game begins, the linebacker coach must try to remember to:
• Remain as focused, yet as objective, as possible.
• Work with and utilize the other assistant coaches.
• Know the defenses and the situations in which they are being used.
121

Evaluate the defense, particularly the play of the linebackers.
Record any mistakes or problems (recognize the opponent's plays that are
hurting the team).
Discuss these mistakes or problems with the linebackers when they come off
the field.
Confer with the other coaches
if problems have been identified which need
their input.
Review mistakes and problems during halftime, make the appropriate
adjustments, and review what is expected to happen
in the second half of the
game.
122

How to Evaluate Your Players' Performance
Following every game, the coach should evaluate the game films.
This review is
usually done on the Sunday immediately following a Saturday game.
The purpose of
this undertaking
is to evaluate techniques, coaching decisions, and personnel
in order
to make sure that the right people are being played
in the appropriate positions and
situations.
After reviewing the films, the coach should have identified each player's
mistakes, the steps which should be taken to correct these mistakes, and how each
player has contributed to the total effort.
It is important also that the players have
some knowledge of the results of the evaluations of their performance.
If a player
has performed well, a report of this fact can serve as an incentive and provide
motivation;
if a player has performed poorly, he should know what mistakes he made
so that he (together with his coach) can take steps
correct them.
An elaborate or complex performance grading system
is neither necessary nor
particularly worthwhile.
With so many variables in grading,
it
is very difficult to be
completely objective.
Certain intangibles, such as how one player complements
another, literally cannot be measured.
The grading system can be used to help make
personnel decisions but should not be the only factor An elaborate evaluation system
should not be used since
it would require a fair amount of time to grade, and thereby
possibly detracting from the time available to prepare for the next opponent.
In most
instances (at the collegiate level particularly),
it
is also not necessary to have signs,
gimmicks, or rewards — evaluation sheets given to the individual player are usually
sufficient.
The linebacker evaluation sheet should be designed so that each linebacker has the
results of his performance on one sheet of paper (refer to Figure 13-1).
Space should
be provided for:
• The total number of plays.
• The number of unassisted tackles made (i.e., the linebacker would have made
the tackle without assistance).
• The number of assisted tackles made (i.e., The linebacker contributed to the
tackle).
• The number of "great hits"
(i.e., a superior tackle).
• The number of "bonus plays:"
- causing a fumble.
- recovering a loose ball.
- making a tackle for a three or more yard loss.
123

- making an interception.
- deflecting a pass.
-
blocl<ing a kick.
- making a crucial play (i.e., a key tackle in a short yardage situation, a
touchdown saving tackle, etc.).
- making a tackle inside the opponent's twenty yard line on a kickoff.
- making a tackle on a punt for no gain.
- making a tackle for a safety.
The number of "loafs"
(i.e., anytime that the ball
is in play and the linebacker
is not going full speed).
The number of poor plays (i.e., violating a principle and not making the play,
missing a tackle, not using good judgment, etc.)
Comments:
- pertinent remarks about the linebacker's performance.
-
critical statements about incorrect play.
- suggestions for improvement and correction of mistakes.
- a good comment about a job well done (i.e., only exceptional performance or
effort).
- a general statement of the overall performance.
124

How to Condition Your Players: Ht to Win
In order for a linebacker to reach his full athletic potential, he must become as
physically fit as his personal genetics will allow.
Dedicated participation
in a sound
conditioning program will ensure that an individual reaches his "physical fitness"
potential, and,
in turn, help him to reach his true potential as a linebacker. A
comprehensive conditioning program for linebackers should include activities aimed
at improving:
• Muscular power
• Running speed
• Anaerobic capacity
• Aerobic capacity
• Agility
• Quickness
Muscular Power
Football, particularly the position of linebacker, requires the demonstration of
muscular power (frequently referred to as explosive strength or explosiveness).
Unfortunately, many coaches do not understand what muscular power really
is.
Power is the rate at which work
is performed,
it
is not just speed of movement nor
is
it simply muscular strength.
It can be represented by the equation:
Power = (Force X Distance)/Time
From this equation,
it
is quite evident that power is dependent upon the interaction
of three factors:
strength (force), speed (time) and flexibility (distance).
Muscular
power can be enhanced by improving any one of the three factors without adversely
affecting the other two.
Factors Contributing to Power
Strength (Force). Strength
is simply the ability to exert muscular force.
It is primarily
determined by the ability of each muscle fiber to generate force and the ability of
the nerves to stimulate a large number o muscle fibers.
Proper strength training
develops individual muscle fibers and enables the body to recruit an increased
number of fibers at any given time.
Strength training for power does not mean fast or explosive training. The speed at
which an individual executes his strength exercises has
little or no beneficial effect
on speed of movement or strength development.
Additionally, explosive training
125

significantly increases the amount of stress placed on the connective tissues, thereby
increasing the individual's injury potential.
High intensity (high-tension) training is
proper strength training (i.e., training with relatively heavy weightloads in a controlled
manner).
In order to develop maximum strength, an athlete should:
(1
) lift and lower resistances
in a controlled manner to ensure that the exercising muscle—not momentum— is
responsible for executing the movement; (2) exercise the muscle through
its full range
of motion to ensure that flexibility is maintained and that the muscle strengthened at
all joint angles; (3) include exercises for all the major muscle groups of the body; this
will increase overall body strength and will help to prevent injuries by maintaining
muscle balance; and (4) progressively increase resistances as muscular adaptation
occurs overtime.
Speed (Time). The time required for force application
is most closely related to speed
of movement.
Speed of movement is a very complex factor that requires precise
coordination between the nervous and muscular systems.
It is highly dependent upon
the development of efficient motor neuron pathways.
Therefore, speed of movement
can be enhanced by improving coordination, efficiency of movement, and timing.
It
requires endless hours of repetitive, skill-specific training to improve one's
coordination, efficiency of movement and timing.
Skill-specific training
is critical for
increasing speed and subsequently power.
Movement speed for a particular athletic event depends primarily on inherited
neuromuscular factors, and secondarily on quality skill practice.
Athletes should
practice their skills through the particular activity's range of motion, concentrating
on the optimal sequence of events to fine tune their coordination and timing.
For
best results, skills should be practiced exactly as they will be performed
in
competition.
Flexibility (Distance). The distance component of the power equation can be limited
by an individual's functional range of motion.
For example, the velocity at which
athletes throw different objects (baseballs, footballs, javelins, etc.) can be severely
limited by poor shoulder girdle flexibility.
Joint range of motion can be improved
through proper strength and flexibility training.
A static stretching (i.e., slowly stretching a muscle past its normal length and holding
the stretch) program can be used to improve joint flexibility.
The intensity of the
exercises for the slow, static stretching should be just below the pain threshold of
the individual. A sound program will include exercises for each of the major muscle
groups of the body.
In the initial stages of a static stretching program, the stretched position should be
held for approximately 10-15 seconds. As flexibility improves, the stretched position
can be held for up to a maximum of 60 seconds for each repetition.
The total length
126

of time for the workout will be roughly 10 minutes, depending on the number of
exercises performed.
Proper stretching can significantly improve an individual's joint
flexibility.
Improved joint flexibility can increase power by enabling an athlete to
apply force over a greater distance and usually with more ease and fluidity.
Running Speed
Running speed
is primarily a function of stride frequency and stride length.
Stride
frequency can be defined as the number of steps you take when running for a given
length of time or distance.
It
is a direct reflection of the speed with which you are
able to move your limbs. The ability to move the limbs at an increased velocity relies
on two factors:
fiber type composition of the muscles providing the limb movement,
and the neurological efficiency of the involved muscle groups (i.e., the nervous
system's ability to transmit impulses from the brain to the receptors
in the contracting
muscles).
Not much can be done to dramatically alter a player's genetic components;
however, through proper training, functional capabilities can be enhanced.
Stride
length
is the distance you can cover with each stride.
Stride length requires functional
strength (i.e., ability to apply force through the range of motion) of the extensor
muscles of the hips, knees, and ankles.
The individual should also possess sufficient
flexibility in the joints involved to allow a greater range of motion and fluidity. An
effective program to develop sprinting speed should include work in three distinct
areas:
strength training, flexibility training, and quality sprint training.
Speed
is
basically a result of the rapid application of force by muscular contractions and
is an
important component of muscular power.
Strength Training.
In order to maintain balance between muscle groups, a properly
designed strength training program should include exercises for all the major muscular
structures of the body.
To develop leg strength for sprinting,
all muscle groups of the
lower body should be trained, including the gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, hip
flexors, adductors/abductors, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles. A limited number
of sets should be performed with rep ranges varying according to the desired result.
The relationship between muscular strength and muscular endurance can be
expressed by using the concept of the repetition continuum.
Using rep ranges toward
the lower end of the continuum (6-8 reps) emphasizes muscular strength, while the
rep ranges greater than 10-12, enhance muscular endurance to a greater degree.
To
develop muscular strength for sprinting, the number of repetitions should be kept
toward the lower end of the continuum, in the range of 6-10.
It is important to keep
in mind, however, that the lower the rep range used, the heavier the resistance loads,
and consequently, the greater potential of injury.
Throughout the training year, the
repetition ranges utilized may change to increase muscular strength and muscular
endurance while also introducing variety into the program.
Each repetition should be
performed at a controlled speed of movement for all exercises. As the muscles which
provide leg drive become stronger, their ability to overcome inertia and accelerate
the body mass increases, thus enhancing the athlete's potential for speed.
127

Flexibility Training. A proper strength training program will increase the muscles'
ability to exert force. As stated before, however, this functional strength must be
exerted through an appropriate range of motion.
Flexibility training should include
static stretching of the muscle groups of the lower body, as well as running drills to
increase dynamic flexibility and facilitate a relaxed running style.
Static stretching
should be performed both before (following a warm-up) and especially after the
running workout.
There are a number of form running drills that may be included in
the program.
Drills we have utilized at Penn State include high knees, heel kicks,
power skips, and arm action drills.
Quality Sprinting. The ability to sprint
is an athletic event in itself and requires
precise coordination of agonists/antagonists via specific motor pathways.
The
principle of specificity states that
in order to "fine tune" the motor pathways required
to perform a given skill, an individual should practice the skill exactly as
it will be
performed
in competition.
In other words, by increasing the coordination of the
muscle groups involved in sprinting, speed of movement of these body segments will
increase. An athlete can spend time performing various running drills to increase
dynamic flexibility and to enhance proper technique, but to provide an effective
training stimulus, the program must ultimately include maximal speed sprints.
Generally, the length of the sprints
is determined by the requirements of the particular
event.
For the sport of football, distances ranging from 10 yards up to 50-60 yards
are appropriate.
Initially, a limited number of repetitions (generally between 4 and
10) should be performed. As conditioning levels improve, a greater number of sprints
may be completed.
The key ingredient
is the quality of work.
All quality sprints
should be run full speed (95-100% effort) with complete recovery allowed between
repetitions.
If the recovery time between sprints
is not sufficient, sprint times will
increase and hence the intensity of training declines. When the heart returns to 130
beats per minute, the athlete
is probably approaching nearing adequate recovery.
This
is not an absolute reality.
Individuals will respond differently, depending upon
their level of training.
The bottom line
is that an athlete should feel almost fully
recovered before sprinting again.
Anaerobic Capacity
Anaerobic conditioning (sometimes referred to as "sprint conditioning")
is necessary
to increase an individual's ability to perform repeated maximal bursts of activity
interspersed with periods of rest. The goal of the anaerobic conditioning portion of
the workout is to overload the anaerobic system to increase the ability of the body to
supply energy (ATP) to the muscles
in the absence of oxygen.
During anaerobic
conditioning, the intensity of effort will be high, but because of the increased amount
of exercise and shorter rest intervals, the absolute speed of the repetitions may not
be as high as in "speed" sprinting. The goal
is to place an effective metabolic demand
on the athlete rather than worrying about maximal speed repeats.
In order to train
the anaerobic system, exercise intervals should be kept below two minutes because
aerobic energy stores are increasingly called upon as exercise intervals increase in
duration.
If the exercise intervals used are 30 seconds or longer, the rest intervals
128

on the athlete rather than worrying about maximal speed repeats.
In order to train
the anaerobic system, exercise intervals should be kept below two minutes because
aerobic energy stores are increasingly called upon as exercise intervals increase in
duration.
If the exercise intervals used are 30 seconds or longer, the rest intervals
should be initially set at three to four times as long. As conditioning improves, this
exercise/rest ratio may decrease to 1-to-1
or even 1-to- 1/2,
in order to provide
progressive overload.
If the sprint distances chosen are 20 seconds or less, recovery
periods should be limited to 10-15 seconds. The sprint distances chosen will depend
on the demands of the sport or position.
Keep
in mind that
it is difficult to "condition"
the athlete with very short sprints.
Sprints shorter than 20 yards should be used for
agilities and other position-specific drills.
For sprint conditioning purposes, distances
at least 20 yards or greater are most effective.
The total number of repetitions
performed in the sprint conditioning period will depend on the length of the exercise
interval (sprint distance).
Increasing the amount of exercise
is another method to
provide progressive overload. Remember that the total volume (amount) of exercise
will be greater than that performed during the quality sprint portion of the workout.
As the number of repetitions increases, they can be segmented
in order to allow an
extended rest period (2-10 minutes) between sets.
Aerobic Capacity
Aerobic capacity refers to the ability of an individual to use oxygen during prolonged
and strenuous exercise. An athlete's ability to recover from all-out, intermittent
bursts of activity is highly related to his aerobic capacity.
All factors considered, a
football player with a high aerobic capacity will be able to perform longer, with less
fatigue, and at a higher level of functioning than one with a low aerobic capacity.
A football player can significantly improve his aerobic capacity by adhering to the
following basic guidelines:
• Engage in continuous, dynamic activities that involve the large muscles of the
body (e.g., running, cycling, stair climbing, etc.)
• Exercise at a level of intensity that
is equivalent to 70-85% of maximum
capacity (i.e., a training of between 150-175 beats per minute for most high
school-age and college-age football players).
• Sustain the aerobic activity for a duration of at least 20 minutes but not more
than 60 minutes.
• Perform the aerobic activity three to five times per week.
Agility
Agility, like speed,
is largely influenced by the precise coordination that occurs
between the muscular and nervous systems.
In order for an athlete to experience
optimal improvement in agility, the agility drills performed during training should
mimic skills the athlete must perform in competition (drills involving agility can been
found in Chapters 8 and
9).
The remark of the old football coach upon watching
129

players perform the traditional tire drill during practice illustrates a proper view of
agility drills: "We don't have tires on the football fields for games in our conference."
Quickness
Response time
is the time required for an individual to initiate a response to a specific
stimulus and to move part of his body from one point to another.
Coaches often refer
to this motor skill as "quickness".
Obviously, this
is a highly valuable trait for football
players.
Like agility, the most effective methods for improving an athlete's quickness
are general conditioning and specificity training.
To enhance quickness, an athlete
should adhere to the following general principles:
• Place a demand on all involved systems.
• Regular practice of all specific skills
• Engage in a sound strength training program.

Eat to Compete: Nutrition For Football
Research has shown that coaches can be important sources of nutrition information
for athletes—particularly the adolescent athlete.
Because the nutritional habits that
an individual develops in high school usually continue throughout his college athletic
career and into adulthood,
it is critical that coaches encourage their athletes to
adhere to sound nutritional practices. While almost all available data on the subject
indicates that no single food will make an individual into a champion, a corresponding
amount of evidence suggest that poor nutritional habits can— in fact—prevent an
athlete from playing up to his genetic potential.
Besides the effect on an individual's
gridiron performance, an unsound diet will also have a negative affect on a player's
health—an impact of profound importance.
In order to be able to offer sound advice concerning nutrition fundamentals, a
coach
should be able to address and answer the following three questions (issues) with his
players;
• What should be included
in a training diet?
• What should be eaten the day before a game?
• What should be eaten for a pre-game meal?
The Training Diet
Calories for growth, development, basal metabolism, and physical activity are derived
from three main sources:
carbohydrates, protein and fat.
While
it is true that alcohol
can contribute many calories to an individual's diet, this drug
is not
a useful source
of calories for competitive athletes (or for anyone else for that matter).
Since the major energy source for muscular contraction
is derived from stored
carbohydrates
in the form of liver and muscle glycogen, the diet should be high
in
carbohydrates, A diet that
is 55 to 60% carbohydrates will maintain glycogen stores
during the training season. When too
little carbohydrate
is eaten, these stores
become low.
After several days on a low carbohydrate diet in combination with daily
two-hour workouts, muscle glycogen levels can decrease to less than 50% of normal.
These low levels can contribute to feelings of tiredness, soreness, and general
fatigue.
If humans had to depend only on their glycogen stores to support daily living
activities, we would run out of energy in less than 24 hours.
Because of this
inadequate amount and because athletes rely on these stores for the majority of their
energy expenditure, a diet high
in carbohydrate
is necessary.
131

Not only is
it recommended that an athlete's diet be high
in carbohydrates, but the
sources of his carbohydrates should be mostly complex carbohydrate or starch.
Foods
such as pasta, bread, muffins, bagels, rice, potatoes, and cereals are recommended
rather than foods high in simple sugar.
While
it is true that sweet foods such as soda
pop, candy, and desserts contribute to glycogen stores, these foods do not contain
other essential vitamins and minerals.
For this reason, athletes are encouraged to
eat the more nutrient dense, starch foods rather than sweets to build muscle glycogen.
Because any players feel that they need a snack before afternoon practice, they often
reach for a candy bar and can of soda. While this sugar snack does provide a feeling
of well-being and give "energy" during the early stages of practice, they may find that
after about 30 to 60 minutes a feeling of sluggishness sets in
. The reason for this
sluggishness
is that the sugar in the snack does not maintain the blood sugar level
as long as a snack would which combines protein, fat, and carbohydrate. A better
snack before practice would be a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cheese and
crackers, or a piece of fruit.
Most athletes find
it surprising that their protein needs are not as high as they
believe.
It is true that athletes require more protein than non-athletes.
It is also true
that growing athletes require more protein than adult athletes.
However, the extra
food that is eaten to support growth and the athletic activity fulfills the protein needs
of the athlete.
In this way the athlete
is eating both calories and protein for growth
and muscle development. An example of how an athlete can fulfill his need for protein
is as follows:
T. D. Smith
is a 17 year old football player and weighs 190 lbs. (86.4 kilograms).
He
requires between
1 .0 and
1 .5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
From these
calculations then, he needs to eat between 86 and 129 grams of protein each day.
T. D.
could obtain
1
1
grams of protein from eating two low-fat yogurts, three ounces of baked
chicken breast, one cup of green peas, and four, eight-ounce cartons of skim milk.
The
vegetable protein contributed by complex carbohydrates will easily push T D. beyond his
actual requirement.
It
is not unusual to find that football players consume two to three times the amount
of protein that they need to continue to grow and develop more muscle. The research
is not clear about the hazards of eating excessive amounts of protein over a long
period of time.
It is known, however, that excessive consumption of protein
is not
beneficial for athletes. Two basic arguments exist for encouraging athletes not to
consume excessive amounts of protein.
First of all, protein that the body does not
need
is not stored as protein.
Depending on the energy needs of the body, this extra
protein
is stored as fat or used for energy.
To use dietary protein as a source of
energy is a very inefficient metabolic process.
Dietary carbohydrate
is a much better
source of energy.
Secondly, when extra dietary protein
is metabolized,
its nitrogen
protein
is excreted
in the urine in the form of urea.
In order to excrete these large
132

diets increase the athlete's risk of dehydration.
For these two reason,
it
is
recommended that approximately 15% of the calories come from the protein in foods.
Many advertisements promote the use of "protein drinks" or "protein powders" for
weight gain or increases
in muscle mass.
These products typically contain both a
carbohydrate and a protein source and simply add extra calories to the athlete's diet.
It is true that muscular development does not occur without enough calories, but the
typical high school or collegiate football player eats enough protein and calories for
muscle growth.
If a player buys one of these expensive products in the hopes of
gaining weight, his money would be better spent by eating "normal food" more often
during the day so that he has more opportunities to consume more calories. When
liquid supplements are preferred for between meal snacks, instant breakfast drinks
made with 2% milk can be used. These instant drinks can be purchased at a
supermarket and are much less expensive than weight gain powders.
While weight gain and muscle building powders continue to be advertised, a newer
addition to the marketplace
is single amino acid supplements.
It is true that amino
acids are the "building blocks" of proteins since all proteins are made up of amino
acids.
It is also true that eight are considered to be "essential"—that
is, these eight
amino acids cannot be made or synthesized by the body and must be eaten. What is
not true, however,
is that supplements of amino acids are needed by healthy football
players.
For example, one egg, two eight-ounce cartons of milk and a three-ounce
hamburger provides an excess of essential amino acids for a 170 pound young athlete.
Unfortunately, however, eating an excessive amount of amino acids can have a
negative impact on an athlete.
Just as described above, they will not be stored as
amino acids in the body, but will be inefficiently utilized or stored as fat. Amino acid
supplementation also has the potential to increase the risk of dehydration.
Furthermore, they are very expensive.
In the past several years, arginine and ornithine—two amino acids that the body
makes plenty of—have been promoted for their growth hormone releasing capabilities.
They are advertised to athletes under the guise that in high amounts, these amino
acids can stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.
It is
further believed that extra growth hormone causes larger muscles. The facts about
arginine and ornithine are as follows:
• When administered to people with a suspected growth hormone deficiency,
these amino acids are used to see
if the growth hormone secretion
is normal.
• Because the liver quickly metabolizes the extra amino acids not required by
the body,
it is unlikely that these oral supplements have any effect on growth
hormone release.
133

• Adults with diseases that cause an abnormally large secretion of growth
hormone are not necessarily thin or good athletes.
Quite to the contrary, they
suffer from acromegaly.
This disorder causes disfiguring enlargements of the
bones of the face, hands and feet. They also sometimes suffer from symptoms
similar to those of diabetes.
Similar to the aforementioned discussion on protein, the money spent for these amino
acids would be much better spent on high carbohydrate foods to increase muscle
glycogen stores.
The final nutrient in the training diet that provides calories
is fat. As might be
expected, the recommendation for fat consumption for the high school or collegiate
football player
is lower than what is typically consumed. Many athletes obtain 40%
of their calories from fat, although a diet which has a fat content of 30% or lower is
recommended.
Often calories from fat are not readily obvious.
Since one teaspoon
of margarine, butter,
oil, or mayonnaise contains 45 calories and
is pure fat,
it is
relatively easy to eat much more fat than you would expect.
Since foods that are
high
in complex carbohydrates or starches are not high
in fat, an athlete's fat intake
normally tends to decrease as he eats more carbohydrates.
Fluids are also an important factor in the training diet. The best fluid replacer for a
football player
is cool water.
Fluids that contain sugar are not emptied from the
stomach or intestinal tract as quickly as water.
If players believe that they need a
sugared beverage, diluting a commercial drink with three parts of water to one part
beverage
is a good compromise.
Excessive water loss through perspiration can lead to a dangerous situation for a
football player. A loss of only 3% of the body weight can lead to impaired
performance, while heat exhaustion can begin when 5% of the body's weight has
been
lost.
To avoid this, athletes should be required to drink water before practice,
during practice, and after practice.
Each one pound of weight lost during practice or
a game should be replaced with two cups of water.
The Meals Eaten the Day Before the Game
If a player
is eating a diet that is normally high
in carbohydrates, he may not need to
make any dietary changes the day before a game. Many players use the day before
to eat foods high
in carbohydrate to maximize their glycogen stores.
Since glycogen
synthesis takes several hours, there
is time to do this the day before, but not the day
of a game.
Several hours are also needed to ensure maximal hydration of the body.
The night before an early afternoon game
is also a good time to drink extra water.
The Pre-Game Meal
The purpose of the pre-game meal
is two-fold.
First of all,
it should keep the players
from getting hungry during the game.
Secondly, the pre-game meal
is important to
134

from getting hungry during the game.
Secondly, the pre-game meal
is important to
provide fluids to maintain or improve the players' hydration status.
Beyond these
two guidelines,
it
is difficult to make specific recommendations because many
psychological factors have been linked to the pre-game meal.
For many players this
meal
is smaller than other meals. As a standard rule of thumb, most nutritionist
recommend that a pre-game meal should contain approximately 500 calories.
Furthermore, this meal usually should not contain spicy foods, unless these are
typically consumed.
It should be low in fat, because fat slows the emptying of the
stomach.
Food
left in the stomach and intestinal tract at the beginning of the game
may cause nausea or cramping.
Since anxiety and excitement also slow digestion,
a high fat meal can add to these gastrointestinal problems.
Players who are
particularly bothered by anxiety may prefer to drink liquid meals. These are emptied
from the stomach faster than a meal of solid food.
Once again, the fluid of choice at the pre-game meal
is water.
If the team eats
together at a restaurant, coaches should request that pitches of cold water be put on
the tables.
The availability of water may encourage players to refill their glass more
often.
While coffee, tea, and cola beverages are high
in water, these are not
recommended because of the caffeine content.
Caffeine acts as a diuretic and a
central nervous system stimulant.
Caffeine can cause water loss from the body and
can increase an athlete's level of nervous excitement before the game.
Conclusion
Nutrition recommendations for athletes have undergone dramatic changes in the past
fifteen years.
Unfortunately, while the amount of interest and research
in sports
nutrition has greatly increased the knowledge available to coaches and athletes, the
level of nutrition misinformation has also flourished.
Hopefully, the recommendations,
explanations, and ideas presented
in this chapter will help you answer your players'
questions and contribute to their winning performance.
