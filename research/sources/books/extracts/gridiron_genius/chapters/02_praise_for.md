GRIDIRON GENIUS

“Simply put, Michael Lombardi’s first-person, all-access, total-insider account of working with three dynastic legends is as good a behind-the-scenes sports book as I’ve ever read.”

“Michael Lombardi got his master’s in football from the Masters of Football—Bill Walsh, Al Davis, Bill Belichick. Now he passes those memorable lessons on to his fortunate readers so that they can receive an advanced education in coaching, personnel, management, and strategy.”

—Adam Schefter, ESPN NFL Insider and author of 
The Man I Never Met

“This is a solid insider look at how NFL teams are made, and is also a useful guide for sports coaches—or office managers—creating their own teams.”

—
Publishers Weekly

“Fans will immerse themselves in this revealing insider’s glimpse into pro football….His comments on the skills required of NFL head coaches are particularly revealing: x’s and o’s, sure, but also practical concerns like setting clear guidelines for discipline, making room arrangements on the road, even planning meals and diets. Those who read this informative, eye-opening account will learn much about what makes a great NFL team.”

Booklist

“Every coach, leader, strategist, and recruiter of talent should read this book.”

—Ryan Holiday, bestselling author of 
The Obstacle Is the Way

“My only criticism of Michael Lombardi’s book is that I enjoyed it too much. The characters and stories were irresistible. But make no mistake; this is a very serious book. Lombardi extracts a meticulous and full-fledged blueprint for organizational excellence from a raft of hard evidence. This is a guidebook for excellence—and it applies way beyond the gridiron. Any thoughtful business leader, for example, could assemble a bundle of useful, integrated ideas that could transform organizational performance. Bravo!”

In Search of Excellence

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

“In 
Gridiron Genius,
 Michael Lombardi provides unparalleled insight into three of the greatest minds in the game of football. His analysis of how they each led their organizations and kept them high functioning in an ever-changing environment makes this book a fascinating read.”

—Chris Ballard, general manager of the Indianapolis Colts

“Michael Lombardi has a brilliant football mind. He also possesses an amazing ability to see the game from every angle. His ability to take you inside the sport is pure genius.”
