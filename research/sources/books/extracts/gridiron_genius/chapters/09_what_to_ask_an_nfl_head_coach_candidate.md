# WHAT TO ASK AN NFL HEAD COACH CANDIDATE

WHAT TO ASK AN NFL HEAD COACH CANDIDATE

There’s a popular social media meme that quotes Marcus Aurelius as having said, “The secret of all victory lies in the organization of the nonobvious.” If Chapter 2 has shown anything, it’s that sometimes the nonobvious looks pretty obvious from a different angle. But how can one possibly predict how a potential coach will handle the unpredictable? Our failures in the hiring process in Oakland led me to develop an addendum to my Rams notebook and my pillars of coaching leadership. To help with the interviewing of head coaching candidates, I created an extensive outline of inquiry that explores every nonobvious wrinkle of organization and team building that a head coach needs to control to conquer the modern-era NFL.
