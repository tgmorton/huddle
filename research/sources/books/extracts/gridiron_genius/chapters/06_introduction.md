JUMPING THE ROUTE

Something just did not look right.

—BILL BELICHICK

With 26 seconds left in Super Bowl XLIX, the Seattle Seahawks had the ball at the 1-yard line with three chances to advance the 36 inches Pete Carroll’s team needed to defeat Bill Belichick’s New England Patriots. Although the rest of the world believed the game was all but over, I knew the truth.

Belichick had the Seahawks right where he wanted them.

I had rejoined Belichick’s staff about a year earlier, in February 2014. It was the culmination of three decades of my bearing witness to a handful of brilliant, driven men as they revolutionized America’s real national pastime. My education began in 1984, when I was lucky enough to join Bill Walsh’s staff as a scouting assistant at the beginning of the San Francisco 49ers dynasty, and I have been taking notes ever since.

After four years with Walsh, for whom I worked my way up to an area scout position, I moved on to Cleveland. By the time I left nine years later, I was the Browns’ director of pro personnel. But more important, along the way I swapped one legendary mentor for another as Belichick arrived in 1991 to begin honing his head coaching skills. Then it was on to Oakland, where I spent a decade with the National Football League’s last true maverick, Al Davis, as a senior assistant, the kind of vague title Davis handed out when he didn’t want anyone to know what exactly was going on behind the curtain in Raiderland. After a return to Cleveland, this time to be general manager, I found myself back with Belichick, this time in New England. My title with the Patriots—coaching assistant—did not begin to define my role. I was there to prepare the team for the college draft and free agency and to contribute to game planning. It was a mix of scouting and coaching, with a little organizational health maintenance thrown in.

By then, Belichick had been ensconced in New England for 14 years and was gaining traction as the greatest coach ever—of any sport, in any era. I was thrilled to be back in the fold.

And then I showed up for my first day of work.

It was a miserable winter day in Foxborough and an equally miserable setting. The predawn staff meeting convened in a tiny, windowless subterranean bunker that was serving as Belichick’s office while the stadium was being remodeled. Each time the famous coach brought up his team’s horrendous goal-line defense—the one that gave up 13 touchdowns and 2 field goals in 15 “goal-to-go” situations the previous season—his mood increasingly matched his surroundings: dark, cold, and ominous. All the men in the room were terrified, myself included, but to be completely honest, I was also curious to watch the master at work again. The problem that had his full attention was one of modern football’s most challenging: how to evolve the goal-line defense in an era of spread passing attacks.

Here’s the dilemma in a nutshell: The traditional goal-line defense is known as a 6-2 for the six defensive linemen and the two linebackers who back them up in a large-body attempt to clog an inside run game. The other three defenders are defensive backs, typically two fleet-footed corners and one hard-hitting safety, tasked with pass coverage. This scheme worked for decades because around the goal line NFL offenses generally relied on a dense power formation that replaced some receivers with blocking tight ends to bolster the short-yardage run game and typically left some defensive backs with no one to cover. In the endless chess game that is NFL strategy, however, teams had begun to take more and more chances through the air in goal-line situations, employing a spread formation that featured at least three receivers and forced the defense to cover the entire width of the field. Most significantly, a three-wide-receiver formation resulted in a very exploitable mismatch against a secondary with only one safety.

“We need a traditional goal-line defense that can also cover three receivers,” Belichick told us, his mind churning through a thousand different possibilities like a gridiron computer.

The only way to do that was to replace the safety in the 6-2 with a third corner who would be a better matchup for a speedy wide receiver. Doing that, however, would take one of New England’s best players, safety Devin McCourty, off the field. Belichick weighed the risks and decided he was willing to take the chance. It wouldn’t be easy. Often, taking away one element of the offense makes the defense vulnerable in other ways. I call it the “Curly in the Boat Problem.” You know the one: The Three Stooges are in a rowboat that springs a leak, and Curly has the bright idea to punch another hole in the hull to let the water out, creating, of course, a much bigger problem. That wasn’t going to happen in New England. Belichick is a lot of things, but he’s definitely not a stooge.

Nor is he reckless. Indeed, as much of an iconoclast as Belichick can be—as much of a rule breaker and gambler—he is also a traditionalist, the son of a football coach who believes that although practice doesn’t make perfect, it gets you closer to perfection each time you do it. He is a five-tool leader, adept at 
strategy, tactics,
 
preparation,
 
execution,
 and what you might call 
situational intuition,
 the rare ability to know which among the first four is required and when.

We worked over the next months, throughout the entire off-season and preseason, implementing and perfecting Bill’s ingeniously simple goal-line solution. Once the season started, though, we never encountered a situation that called for the three-corner goal-line formation—a 62 Nickel, you might call it. Not one time. The same thing held true in the postseason against the Baltimore Ravens and the Indianapolis Colts: no cause to debut our goal-line gamble. Seven months, hundreds of practices, thousands of man-hours, and almost two dozen preseason and regular-season games had gone by. All the time and energy invested in perfecting Belichick’s goal-line wrinkle was looking very much like an utter waste.

Until the Seahawks had the ball on our doorstep with 26 seconds left in Super Bowl XLIX.

On that warm Arizona night, everybody could practically feel the time, the game, and some small part of Belichick’s legacy slipping away. Well, everybody except Belichick, who wasn’t worried about any of it. He wasn’t about to drill a second hole in his rowboat. Instead, Bill was focused intently on the Seattle sideline. From his vantage point across the field at the University of Phoenix Stadium, he sensed confusion and indecision in his opponent. “Something just did not look right,” he told me later. Instead of calling a time-out, an eerily calm Belichick just stared straight ahead, a predator stalking his prey.

Suddenly, he burst into action, becoming the aggressor. Shouting into his headset, Belichick commanded: “Just play goal line.” Except he didn’t mean our traditional 6-2 goal line. Instead, our safeties coach, Brian Flores, yelled, “Malcolm, go!” and undrafted rookie Malcolm Butler entered the game as the third corner.

Everyone had expected Belichick to take a time-out to preserve precious seconds for his team if they got the ball back after the Seahawks inevitably took the lead—everyone including Seattle’s coach, Pete Carroll. When no time-out came, I suspect it might have thrown him just a little. Whatever the case, Carroll looked to the field, saw the six Patriots defensive linemen there, and yelled into his own headset, “They’re in goal line!” His countercall, sending in three receivers, was intended to spread the field. Instead, it played right into Belichick’s trap.

I’ve studied the NFL’s smartest men my whole career, and it’s never anything less than breathtaking when you realize they are operating on a different level than their peers. Believing they had speed and horizontal space on their side, Seattle stacked two receivers on the right. At the snap, though, Butler, a cornerback skilled in man coverage—as opposed to the safety who ordinarily would have been in that spot—expertly read the play. He exploded toward wideout Ricardo Lockette, beating him to the ball and securing the most critical interception in Super Bowl history, not to mention yet another Lombardi Trophy for Belichick and the Patriots.

Someone wise once said: “The world gets out of the way for people who know where they are going.” He might as well have been describing my 13-year-old self in the summer of 1972, when I discovered Strat-O-Matic baseball with my two best friends, Michael Sannino and Danny Reynolds. From the moment I opened the box of that early sports-simulation game, I knew my calling.

The weather along the Jersey Shore made famous by Bruce Springsteen was hot and humid and the beach was just a two-minute walk away, but the three of us pretty much stayed in my mother’s air conditioner–less kitchen from sunrise to sunset. The game—a precursor to fantasy that consisted of cards with outcomes informed by the actual stats of real Major League Baseball players and activated by dice throws—unleashed a passion in each of us. We made our own rules, insisting on a two-to-one vote for any changes. We gave each player card a grade that was based on our own statistical analyses. We held leaguewide drafts rather than accepting the teams as they were packaged. Each of us was fully committed to the dual roles of GM and coach for his team. (To paraphrase the Hall of Fame football coach Bill Parcells, we not only shopped for the groceries, we cooked, too.)

In other words, we were obsessed, except that the obsession extended far beyond childhood for me. Strat-O-Matic, as I think back, gets most of the credit for my love of scouting and team building. Later that decade I transferred my obsession to the NFL draft. It wasn’t anything like it is today: a significant event in a carefully scripted year-round NFL calendar that attracts millions of fans from all over the world. There was no television coverage for any of the rounds—that started in 1980—let alone all of them, and so if you wanted to follow in real time (as I most certainly did), you had to make your way to the host hotel in New York City. Seats were limited, which meant, for me, taking an early Long Island Rail Road train from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, to make sure I got one. The palpable current of excitement and potential on draft day assured me that this was what I wanted to do for my life’s work.

Strat-O-Matic aside, my first love was football since the moment in the late 1960s when I saw a man on our family’s little black-and-white television who had the same last name as mine (and who looked like one of my uncles). That man, Vince Lombardi, legendary Green Bay Packers coach, didn’t have to be related to me to become my role model.

Like most boys, I dreamed of one day suiting up in the NFL. Man, I wanted to play. And so I did: on Pop Warner teams; in high school in Ocean City, New Jersey; and then in boarding school at Valley Forge Military Academy in Pennsylvania, which I attended in part to learn discipline but also to stay on the field while I got my grades up so that I could attend a good college. By then I knew an NFL career was not in the cards—I was already a good enough scout to evaluate my own athletic gifts as lacking—but I decided to go to a school somewhere that would allow me to prolong my career a bit longer as I figured out how to get a job on an NFL sideline or in a front office. College let me stay in the game, but it also let me learn the game. I often spent weekends attending coaching clinics throughout the Northeast. Frat parties were not my thing; football was the dream, and I chased it hard.

In some ways I’m still chasing. I often think about the legendary baseball executive Branch Rickey, who, after being fired at age 74 as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was asked to name his most significant accomplishment. Rickey—who, among other achievements, orchestrated Jackie Robinson’s breaking of the Major League Baseball color barrier and invented the game’s farm system—quietly replied, “It hasn’t happened yet.”

Although this book is drawn from a lifetime spent in football front offices, it’s not a life story as most are written. I won’t bore you with tales of inspiring childhood coaches (though I certainly had them) or highlights from my own playing career (I had a few of those, too). I will leave the teaching of technique and fundamentals to better instructors; there will be no extended treatises about the hand placement of the nose tackle or the footwork of the tight end. Although such nuances are the bones and ligaments of the game, I’m more interested in the entire body, with an emphasis on the brain: not only strategy and tactics that make a difference on the field but philosophy and theory that matter off it. Football is ultimately a business, and as in any successful business the most important ingredients are a sound culture, a realistic plan, strong leadership, and a talented workforce.

Rather than a detailed recounting of my life and career—I save that for my kids—this book is meant to be an accounting of the lessons I’ve learned along the way, lessons that I hope will be of interest to serious fans but also to anyone who wants to know about what makes a great organizational thinker in any field: football or the Fortune 500. I will focus on the lessons I’ve learned from the men who, collectively, are largely responsible for the modern game of professional football: Davis, the Hall of Fame Oakland Raiders owner/coach who was the beating heart of the pass-happy American Football League, which merged with and forever changed the stodgy NFL; Walsh, the Hall of Fame inventor of the West Coast offense, which continues to dominate the game today; and Belichick, who may understand more about what happens on a gridiron than anyone else in history.

Each of these men has contributed to my Ph.D. in advanced football. It’s a degree that was 35 years in the making as I worked for, coached alongside, and managed men who have won 11 of those Lombardi Trophies, many of those wins the result of the kind of foresight, ingenuity, and sheer force of will displayed by Belichick during that goal-line stand in Arizona. The story behind that now-legendary play is just one of many that I have collected over my career, and if you have listened to my podcast work or read my pieces for The Ringer and elsewhere, you may recognize some of what I have to say here. But much more of it will be new. I could argue that no one has had as much direct access as I have to the men most responsible for transforming pro football into the game it is today. And I would argue that no one is better suited to highlight and explain the brilliant lessons and revelatory insights of these masters.

If you want to learn lifetime lessons, there’s no better teacher than a lifetime student.

Class begins now.
