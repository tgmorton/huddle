# Cutoff Blocks

Cutoff Blocks
The cutoff block is the most important block used by the offen-
sive line. When well executed, the cutoff block will cut off the backside 
of the defense and create giant seams in the defense. In the zone block-
ing scheme, the point of attack on a run play can be anywhere across 
the offensive line. Long runs on the zone or stretch play are the result of 
the cutoff blocks on the backside that created these runs. When a coach 
is grading the plays, all players on the front side of a zone run should 
get a plus on the grade. The backside cutoff block is the major focus in 
the grading system. This will usually determine the success of the play.
The 18-inch cutoff block is used on the backside of the stretch play. For 
the 18-inch cutoff block, the aiming point is 18 inches inside the defender’s 
thigh. This aiming point will change according to the defender’s align-
ment. If the offense is running an inside zone play, the lineman should 
use a tight cutoff block with an aiming point of the defender’s inside 
breast to armpit. The 18-inch cutoff block is used on the outside zone play.
Approach
The lineman must use the same good stance as with the drive and reach 
blocks. He should use a three-point stance with the proper balance. If the 
tackle is uncovered, he may be in a two-point stance. The main thing is 
that the lineman must be completely balanced so he can move laterally 
to make these cutoff blocks. As with the drive and reach blocks, mental 
weight is a big factor in the execution of the cutoff block.
The footwork is based on the principle of not stepping too big and 
getting off balance. According to the defender’s alignment, the offensive

lineman should focus on the target of 18 inches past the defender’s thigh. 
The first step is a stretch step of 6 to 8 inches (figure 5.1a). The offensive 
lineman throws his head and shoulders over the lead foot and knee. The 
second step comes down quickly on the angle (figure 5.1b). The third 
step needs to stay on the angle with power and force (figure 5.1c). The 
lineman’s arms should be drawn to fire on approach with tight elbows. 
Emphasize the inside arm working strong.

Cutoff Blocks  59
The biggest challenge is focusing only on the aiming point 18 inches 
past the defender’s thigh. The most common mistake made by line-
men—from professional players to high school players—is looking at the 
defender. When this occurs, the lineman’s helmet will land in the middle 
or on the backside of the defender. I describe the technique to players as 
“shooting birds.” You have to lead that bird for him to fly into the shot. 
This is the same on 18-inch cutoff blocks.
The offensive lineman should use his depth of alignment off the football 
to his advantage. This will result in great angles.
Contact and Fit
If the block works out perfectly, the offensive lineman should clear his 
head past the defender. The helmet and outside arm often make first 
contact. The lineman must work hard to keep tight elbows so he can get 
his inside hand hooked up on the inside breastplate as quickly as pos-
sible (figure 5.2).
The lineman should not work for a quick hook or try to pin the defender 
too fast. He should stay on the angle as long as possible or until he has 
complete control of the block. Once control is established, the lineman 
works to finish the defender and lose him backside.
Figure 5.2  Cutoff block contact and fit; helmet placement 
with inside hand hooked up.

60  Complete Offensive Line
Three-point contact is not a big factor in the 18-inch cutoff block. Hands 
are more of a factor. Quickness off the football can play a big role in the 
cutoff block.
When I coached at Southern Illinois University, I had a split tackle, 
Chris Lockwood, who made first-team All-Missouri Valley. He was 
successful because of his ability to execute the cutoff block better than 
anyone I have ever coached. At that time, the offensive line was flip-
flopped; Chris was on the backside of many plays. He played a big role 
in the success of our running game by executing the cutoff block so well.
Drive
When in the fit of the block, the lineman should drive the defender on 
the angle (figure 5.3). Again, the lineman must not work for a quick hook 
once he makes contact. One of the biggest 
mistakes a lineman can make is trying to 
hook the defender as soon as he makes 
contact. To correct this mistake, I take a 
position at an angle and make the blocker 
work to me as I stand at the proper angle.
On a quick hook, the defender will 
fight across the block. Now the blocker 
is working backside and has lost his 
helmet placement. A lot of holding pen-
alties come when the lineman is out of 
position.
While driving the defender on the angle, the lineman should execute 
the same technique as on the reach block. He should work the inside arm 
and leg strong with the back arm in push mode.
Finish
Again, the cutoff block is the most important block to execute. Remember, 
the team whose offensive line does the best job of executing the cutoff 
block will be the team that has the most long runs. Second and third 
efforts are a must for successful cutoff blocks.
If the defender runs hard to the play side, the blocker must try to flat-
ten him down the line of scrimmage. The outside hand and arm must 
be used to drive the defender hard down inside. The lineman must stay 
hooked up, run his feet, and not let the defender come back inside.

Coach
Figure 5.3  The coach stands at 
the proper angle for the offensive 
lineman to release and sprint 
toward the coach. Once he is on 
this angle, the lineman will then 
make contact with the defender 
and be in the proper position to 
make the block.

18-Inch Cutoff Block Versus 3 and 5 Techniques  
(Outside Shade)
In this situation, the offensive lineman 
should aim 18 inches past the defender’s 
thigh. He should then come off to this 
area and execute the technique of the 
cutoff block. The lineman needs to work 
the inside arm and leg strong. He must 
be ready to explode the arms and hands 
when contact is about to be made. He should not work for a quick hook 
block on the defender. The lineman should run the proper angle while 
getting a good feel when he tries to pin the defender to the inside.
Using the 18-Inch Cutoff Block Against 3 and 5 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step doesn’t have to be big because the lineman already 
has great position on the defender. Step should be over and up, 
putting the helmet on course for the 18-inch aiming point.
2.	 Lineman’s outside foot is aimed at the defender’s inside foot.
3.	 Helmet placement on the cutoff block overrules all steps and foot 
position.
4.	 Lineman takes quick third step with inside hand working for posi-
tion and strength.
5.	 Aiming point is 18 inches inside defender’s thigh.
6.	 During contact and fit, lineman works inside arm and leg strong; 
lineman runs the hard angle.
18-Inch Cutoff Block Versus 2 and 4 Techniques  
(Head-Up Alignment)
When the defender is in a head-up alignment on the lineman, the shoes of 
both players will also be aligned. The 18-inch aiming point is now deeper 
to the inside because of the alignment of 
the defender. The offensive blocker needs 
to open his first step slightly deeper than 
he would against a 3- or 5-technique 
defender. Then he can execute the same 
cutoff block as he did on the 3- or 5-tech-
nique player.

Coaching Point
With the aiming point a foot and a half past the defender, the line-
man’s first contact may come with the outside shoulder. The line-
man must work his outside hand inside—to the defender’s outside 
number. He must work hard to get his inside hand on the defender’s 
breastplate and gain control as quickly as possible.
Using the 18-Inch Cutoff Block Against 2 and 4 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step goes inside and must be deeper in order to gain the 
18-inch helmet placement past the defender’s thigh.
2.	 Second step works hard to the defender’s inside foot.
3.	 Quick third step stays on the angle.
4.	 Aiming point is 18 inches past the defender’s thigh.
5.	 Defender is tighter on the lineman. The lineman will have to aim 
deeper inside.
6.	 Lineman makes contact, fits, and drives with outside pad. He must 
initially work hard to gain control of the defender with the inside arm.
18-Inch Cutoff Block Versus 1 and 4I Techniques  
(Inside Shade)
A defender in a 1 technique or 4I technique is aligned deep to the blocker’s 
inside. The lineman’s first step has to be a drop step, which results in 
giving ground to gain even more ground. The offensive lineman must 
be sure to throw the shoulders over the knee in order to get the proper 
angle to make the block. The lineman 
needs to explode and run his feet as hard 
as possible. This will allow him to stay on 
his angle while making up the space cre-
ated by the defender’s alignment (which 
gives the defender a big advantage).

Cutoff Blocks  63
Using the 18-Inch Cutoff Block Against 1 and 4I Techniques
1.	 Stretch step needs to be inside and deep off the ball. The guard 
needs to stretch and sprint through the football.
2.	 Lineman attempts to get second step to the defender’s inside foot 
in order to gain the 18-inch helmet placement.
3.	 Lineman gets third step quickly on the ground; he runs his angle.
4.	 Aiming point is still 18 inches past defender’s thigh.
5.	 Things will happen much faster with the defender in this alignment. 
The wider the man (in this case, inside), the deeper the drop.
6.	 Lineman makes contact and fit with helmet and outside shoulder 
and arm first. He works hard to get the inside arm in control as 
quickly as possible.
7.	 Lineman maintains tight elbows.
Tight Cutoff Versus 3 and 5 Techniques (Outside Shade)
Tight cutoff blocks are just like reach blocks to the outside. The tight 
cutoff is simply reversed to the inside. The defender is already blocked 
by his alignment on the offensive lineman. The offensive blocker has 
the advantage. For the tight cutoff block, 
the aiming point is the inside breast to 
armpit. Basically, against a 3- or 5-tech-
nique defender, all the lineman needs to 
do is perform a short zone step and then 
execute a drive block from his cutoff.
Using the Tight Cutoff Block Against 3 and 5 Techniques
1.	 First step is slightly in and up; lineman then executes a short zone 
step.
2.	 Second step is a quick step to defender’s crotch.
3.	 Third step is straight ahead like the step on a drive block. Lineman 
gets it down on the ground quickly.
4.	 Lineman still works outside hand in push mode; he works inside 
arm and leg strong.
5.	 Aiming point is inside breast to armpit.
6.	 Lineman needs to stay square to the line of scrimmage.

Tight Cutoff Versus 2 and 4 Techniques  
(Head-Up Alignment)
In this situation, the defender positions himself head up and totally even 
with the blocker. The offensive lineman should use a short zone step to the 
inside breast and armpit. Once contact 
is made, the lineman executes the cutoff 
block with the inside arm, hand, and 
leg really strong. He should stay square 
to the line of scrimmage and drive the 
defender off the line of scrimmage.
Using the Tight Cutoff Block Against 2 and 4 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step is to outside of defender’s inside foot. First step doesn’t 
have to be a big step.
2.	 Second step is to defender’s crotch.
3.	 Quick third step is out and upfield, with quick replace.
4.	 Aiming point is inside breast to armpit.
5.	 Defender will be aligned tighter on the offensive lineman.
6.	 Contact, fit, and drive are the same as against a 3- or 5-technique 
defender.
7.	 Lineman needs to stay much more square to the line of scrimmage.
Cutoff Block Versus 1 and 4I Techniques (Inside Shade)
Once again, the defender’s alignment is on the inside shoulder toward the 
play side when the offense is running the football. This gives the defender 
the advantage. The offensive lineman must open the first zone step at a 
much deeper angle to put himself at an advantage on the defender. Once 
contact is made to the defender’s inside 
breast to armpit, this block will usually 
go on a slight angle to the inside. The 
lineman must work hard and strong on 
his inside arm, hand, and leg.

Cutoff Blocks  65
Coaching Point
The wider the defender, the deeper the lineman’s inside foot will 
need to go back. The wider the man, the deeper the drop. With a 
cutoff block, wider relates to inside alignment.
Using the Cutoff Block Against 1 and 4I Techniques
1.	 Stretch step is open toward the defender’s inside foot.
2.	 Second step goes toward the defender’s outside foot.
3.	 Third step must come quickly and hard; the lineman runs the angle. 
Just as in a reach block, the lineman counts 1–quick–2–3.
4.	 Helmet placement is at the defender’s inside breast to armpit.
5.	 Lineman needs to work the inside arm and leg strong.
Drilling the Cutoff Block
Not many drills specifically teach the cutoff block. When drilling the 
cutoff block and teaching its purpose, coaches should use the reverse 
teaching progression. This allows the lineman to learn the fit of the block 
first so that he knows how it should feel when he does the block at full 
speed. Next, the coach should fit the blocker on the defender and then 
let the blocker execute the block from this position.

66
Reverse Teaching the Cutoff Block
In the reverse teaching progression, the player begins by fitting into the 
block and then driving the defender. Next, the blocker goes from his 
stance to the fit of the block. Finally, the player executes the cutoff block 
from the stance to the finish.
The lineman is first fitted into the defender:
• Lineman’s inside hand to defender’s armpit
• Lineman’s helmet past the defender (right shoulder block)
• Lineman’s outside hand on the defender’s outside number
• Lineman’s inside leg past the defender
• Lineman’s outside leg just inside the defender’s inside leg
At the coach’s “go” command, the defender moves inside to help the 
offensive lineman make the best block possible. The lineman works his 
inside arm and leg strong. His outside hand is in push and control mode. 
The lineman works the hard angle and stays as square to the line of 
scrimmage as possible.
Step to the Fit
1.	 The lineman goes back to the approach. He gets in a good stance, 
uses a good inside stretch step, and gets the second and third 
steps down quickly.
2.	 The lineman executes contact and fit. This should be more of an 
outside shoulder block.
3.	 The lineman hits through the fit and stops. It should be a five- or 
six-step process.
4.	 The lineman gets the inside hand in control.

Cutoff Blocks  67
Execute the Cutoff Block
Work with the lines on the ground when drilling the cutoff block. Measure 
lines based on alignments off of center (figure 5.10) so that players will 
be working the proper distance for the blocks—that is, the distance they 
will work in the game. In this drill, the players put together all the phases 
of the cutoff block:
1.	 Stance, start, approach, and lever-
age to block (low pads)
2.	 Contact to fit
3.	 Drive
4.	 Finish
First, the right guard and tackle work on cutoff blocks. Then the center 
practices reach blocks to the left. Next, the left guard and tackle do cutoff 
blocks on their side of the ball.
On the second repetition, after the first and second lines execute their 
cutoff blocks versus head-up technique, I put the tackles in a two-point 
stance. On the second repetition, the defender gets on an inside shade (a 
1 technique) for the guard or a shade on the center. The tackle performs 
a cutoff block against a defender in a 4I technique. The center executes 
a reach block against a 1-technique defender on the guards.
Summary
Remember, repetition is the mother of learning. Linemen should perform 
drive, reach, and cutoff blocks every day at practice except on the day 
before a game. Players must remember to do these blocks every day. Two 
reps a day, every day, will be more helpful than four or five reps one day 
a week. In the next chapter, we’ll address the down block, which is the 
toughest block to learn.
