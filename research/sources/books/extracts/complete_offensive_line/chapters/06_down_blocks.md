# Down Blocks

---

Down Blocks
The down block is the toughest block that an offensive lineman 
must learn. If the defender is a penetrator, the lineman must get his head 
in the V of the defender’s neck and then execute a drive block to stop 
the penetration. If the defender is a reader, the lineman must work more 
upfield to make sure the defender doesn’t come across the lineman’s face 
and play him over the top. The angle of the down block on the defender 
does not allow for a very good aiming point because of the angle or 
direction that the lineman comes from.
To counter the various styles of defensive line play, the offensive line-
man needs to learn a very quick read step (basically the stretch step). 
First, the lineman needs to read the depth of the defender off the football. 
Does the defender play close to the ball with a lot of weight forward? Or 
does he play square and off the football, as a read defender? The aiming 
point is the V of the defender’s neck—that is, the 90-degree area from 
the side of the helmet to the shoulder pad—no matter which style of 
play the defender uses. The lineman’s inside hand works to the inside 
frame of the defender’s body while working across to the far number. 
The lineman’s inside hand should be in the far armpit or breastplate if 
possible. The lineman now needs to try to get his outside hand on the 
defender’s outside arm. He needs to look at the defender as a cylinder 
while splitting the cylinder down the middle.

Approach
If the defender is tight to the line of scrimmage, the offensive lineman’s 
first step is a short stretch step with the inside foot, giving ground to 
gain the proper angle for his hips. The offensive lineman’s second step 
is inside and up toward the defender so the lineman is square on the 
block. The offensive lineman’s third step puts the lineman in the proper 
direction toward the contact point of the block. The offensive lineman’s 
arms should be tight to the body, cocked, and ready to fire on contact. 
Now the offensive lineman stays low with his pads and tries to get on 
the defender as quickly as possible. When the defender is tight to the 
line of scrimmage, the offensive lineman has to be quick and unload his 
block as fast as possible.
If the defender is aligned off the football in a square (read) position, 
the offensive lineman’s first step is a short step with his inside foot, but 
now he stays very square to the line of scrimmage with his shoulders 
square as well. The offensive lineman’s second step is more upfield as 
if he were executing a backside slip block. When the defender tries to 
cross the offensive lineman’s face, the lineman needs to place his face 
mask in the V of the defender’s neck on the third step. His arms should 
be cocked and ready to fire on contact. With the lineman using low pads, 
this should end up like a drive block only the offensive lineman’s helmet 
is on the shoulder pad next to the defender’s helmet; the lineman’s out-
side hand is in the defender’s outside armpit, and his inside hand is on 
the defender’s inside breastplate.
Contact and Fit
For the down block, the contact point is from the helmet to the V of the 
neck of the defender (figure 6.1a). The offensive lineman’s inside hand 
works hard inside to the defender’s far breastplate (figure 6.1b). The 
offensive lineman’s outside hand stays tight inside while the lineman 
tries to get it on the defender’s outside arm (figure 6.1c). The hand must 
be kept off the defender’s back to avoid holding calls.

72  Complete Offensive Line
The offensive lineman needs to imagine 
the defender as a cylinder. He must try to 
stay in the middle of the cylinder (figure 
6.2). The lineman should keep himself 
square on the block; he must not lean 
inside and get off balance, because this 
would allow the defender to beat him.
The lineman should stay square on 
the block as much as possible, working 
hard to keep his outside arm strong 
on the block. If the lineman loses the 
defender, he wants to lose him to the 
inside of the block.
Drive
The offensive lineman should get square on the block. If he catches the 
defender off balance, movement should be easier. The lineman must 
now move his feet and block the defender on the angle. If the defender 
plays tough into the lineman and is holding his ground, the lineman 
must remember that the play is going outside of him. He should keep 
pressure on the block and hold his ground.
The main concern is stopping the penetration of the defender. The key 
to doing this is getting the second and third steps down into the ground 
as quickly as possible. The lineman must continue to drive his feet after 
contact is made. He must drive through the defender and keep pressure 
on the defender at all times.
The lineman should work his outside arm strong to pin the defender 
to the inside. He must not allow the defender to spin outside.
Figure 6.2  On the down block, 
the offensive lineman stays to the 
middle of the cylinder.

Down Blocks  73
Finish
The finish is the basic drive block with a great base. The offensive line-
man should keep consistent pressure on the defender until the whistle 
blows. The lineman must keep his feet moving. He should be ready for 
the defender to try to use a rip or club technique to get out of the block. 
Now it comes down to who wants it the most.
A lot of defensive linemen are taught to spin out of the block and then 
try to come over the top of the offensive lineman. If this happens, the 
offensive lineman must use his hips and work them upfield so he can 
run with the defender.
Down Block Versus a Penetrating Defender
How fast can the block be made? The faster the penetration is attacked, 
the better the block. Against a penetrating defender (figure 6.3), the line-
man needs to get the second step down quickly. He keeps a flat back 
and drives his helmet to the V of the defender’s neck. He should keep 
his eyes on the aiming point of the V of 
the neck. The lineman brings his arms in 
a powerful punch mode. He maintains 
tight elbows when coming out of his 
stance. Once he is into the fit of the block, 
he is essentially executing a drive block.
Fit for the Down Block on a Penetrating Defender
1.	 The lineman gets into the fit position on the defender; the lineman’s 
head is in the V of the defender’s neck.
2.	 The lineman puts his inside hand on the defender’s inside 
breastplate.
3.	 The lineman puts his outside hand on the defender’s outside arm.
4.	 The lineman puts his hip on an angle to the middle of the cylinder.
5.	 The lineman executes the down block on the snap count command.
6.	 The lineman moves his feet and works outside arm pressure strong. 
He works his hips upfield.

Hit Through the Fit on a Penetrating Defender
1.	 The lineman takes a stretch step of 6 to 8 inches (read step).
2.	 The lineman gets the second step down quickly.
3.	 The lineman hits with his helmet to the V of the defender’s neck.
4.	 The lineman maintains tight elbows. He fires his guns to the 
defender’s inside breastplate and outside arm.
5.	 The lineman executes the down block and hits through the defender 
for two or three steps past contact.
6.	 The lineman stops and sits in the fit position.
Coaching Points
The lineman must stay low, stay low, stay low, and move his feet!
Execute the Down Block on a Penetrating Defender
1.	 The lineman executes all of the steps for a good down block and 
blocks the defender on the angle.
2.	 After contact, the lineman drives the defender for 4 to 6 seconds.
Down Block Versus a Read Defender
When blocking on a read defender, the lineman’s first step is the same 
except it is more parallel to the line of scrimmage. When the defender 
plays across the lineman’s face, the lineman should redirect the second 
step upfield as on a drive block. The lineman should still place his head 
to the V of the defender’s neck and work hard to get his outside arm 
strong to help block or pin the defender to the inside.
When a lineman is using a reverse blocking technique against a read 
defender, all the steps are exactly the same as for the block against a 
penetrating defender. The only difference on the fit is that the blocker 
will be squarer to the line of scrimmage. The lineman should get in the fit

position with his head in the V of the defender’s neck. He should work 
all the steps discussed in the section on the fit. He needs to work hardest 
on making the outside arm strong and working the hips upfield much 
quicker. He should hit through the fit on the read defender. The lineman 
takes a stretch step (read step) of 6 to 8 inches. The second step is upfield, 
like the step on a drive block. The lineman hits his helmet to the V of the 
defender’s neck. Maintaining tight elbows, the lineman fires his guns 
to the defender’s inside breastplate and outside arm. After contact, the 
lineman blocks the defender for 4 to 6 seconds. He works hard to pin 
the defender inside. The lineman executes the down block, working his 
outside arm and leg strong. He sits in the fit. The lineman should execute 
all the coaching points and block the defender on the angle.
Down Block Versus a Defender Off the Ball
When the defender is off the ball on a down block, the lineman should 
take his read step but slow down. The block should be different than 
when attacking a penetrating defender. The lineman should slow down 
and read the defender. This allows time to redirect and perform the block.
Drilling the Down Block
Players can learn the down block just like the reach or cutoff block, 
working off two lines. Drill the block off the lines on the field. Players 
should first practice the block with the defender penetrating the line of 
scrimmage. When preparing for a team whose defensive line uses both 
the penetrating and reading techniques, players can work on blocking 
the penetrator one day and the read technique the next day.

76
Hit Through the Fit
1.	 The lineman takes a 6- to 8-inch stretch step with his inside foot 
and opens his hips toward the defender.
2.	 The lineman gets his second step down quickly.
3.	 The lineman keeps his eyes on the target. He puts his helmet to 
the V of the defender’s neck.
4.	 The lineman stays low with tight elbows.
5.	 The lineman explodes his arms to the defender’s inside number 
and outside arm.
6.	 The lineman executes the down block on the angle.
7.	 The lineman moves his feet and works on applying pressure with 
his outside hand and arm. He works his hips upfield.
Drill with two read defenders to one penetrating defender. The center 
needs to get double reps on this block because he is the only lineman 
who has to execute this block to both sides.
Teaching the Block Using the Reverse 
Blocking Progression
1.	 Place five boards on the ground at a 
45-degree angle. Place three of the 
boards facing inside, simulating the 
center, guard, and tackle. The other 
two boards face the opposite way 
(figure 6.4).
2.	 The lineman takes the proper steps and blocks the defender down 
the boards. The center and either the right guard or right tackle will 
work together. This will allow the other guard and tackle to block 
down on their side.
3.	 The coach can place a bag holder on the board. When the player 
makes contact, he will get resistance while going down the board. 
He should work the outside arm and leg strong.
Figure 6.4  Setup for the re-
verse blocking progression.

Down Blocks  77
Reverse Body Block
The last down block that can be used is the reverse body block.
1.	 The lineman takes a wide, open step to open his hips.
2.	 The lineman throws his head and arms in front of the defender to 
stop penetration, and he gets a quick second step down.
3.	 With high hips, the lineman works his butt upfield to the outside. 
He stays on both hands and both feet.
4.	 The lineman executes a four-point crab walk. He keeps pressure 
on the defender with his hips. The lineman should feel the defender 
in his rib area when pressure is applied.
Summary
The down block is one of the toughest blocks to master. For all but wing-T 
teams, it is also one of the least used blocks. The approach, contact, fit, 
drive, and finish are each important to the success of the down block. 
Keeping the eyes on the target and using the aiming point of the V of 
the neck will aid the lineman in making the block.
The next chapter covers combination blocks. Combination blocks 
involve two linemen working together to block a defender on level 1 
while working up to the defender on level 2.

Combination 
Blocks
Combination blocks are blocking schemes in which two or 
more linemen work together on a level-1 defender before one of the 
linemen works off to a defender on level 1, 2, or 3. For example, when 
the guard and center are working play side, the term for their combina-
tion is Jack. Queen is used for the guard–tackle combination. King is the 
tackle–tight end combination. Another term—either you or read—is added 
to describe the combination used to block the defender.
Combination blocks require a lot of repetition and practice because 
of the timing it takes for two linemen to work together. Combo blocks 
involve a post man, who is the covered lineman, and a drive man, who 
is the uncovered lineman. It takes a lot of practice for players to know 
how much of the defender each lineman should cover when executing 
the block.

80  Complete Offensive Line
Center–Guard (Jack) Combination Blocks
The center–guard combo blocks in the zone blocking scheme are Jack You 
and Jack Read. These calls specify who will block the declared linebacker.
Jack You Call
On the Jack You block, the guard has to use his outside footwork with a 
short stretch step. The second step, made with the inside foot, should be in 
the middle of the level-1 defender. This places the guard on the outside half 
of the defender (figure 7.1). By this time, the center should be there to help. 
Once the center is working with the guard, the guard keeps a wide base 
and keeps driving his feet. The guard does not come off the block until the 
linebacker gets almost even with him. Once 
the guard comes off on the linebacker, the 
guard gets in the middle of the linebacker 
and executes a drive block. The guard fin-
ishes the linebacker until the whistle blows.
Jack: center–guard combination block
You: The center tells the guard, “You go get the linebacker.”
On the combo Jack block, the center should snap the football while 
taking a deeper drop step to the blocking side. This will open his hips 
on the proper angle. The center should work on driving his helmet to 
the middle of the level-1 defender and become the drive man. The center 
should use both hands and the helmet on contact and should then move 
the defender on an angle of about 45 degrees. When the center feels the 
guard come off to block the linebacker, the center should have the level-1 
defender covered and should keep blocking until the whistle blows.
Jack Read Call
For the Jack Read call (figure 7.2), the guard should use the same foot-
work and technique that he used on the Jack You call. On this block, the 
center needs to work square to the line of scrimmage while working 
the inside half of the defender. Both the guard and center have to stay 
on the defender until the linebacker declares one side or the other. The 
general rule is that a lineman should not come off onto the linebacker 
until he can read both jersey numbers on 
the linebacker. Once the lineman comes off 
to block the linebacker, the lineman should 
get into the middle of the linebacker and 
block until the whistle.

Combination Blocks  81
Jack: center–guard combination block
Read: The center tells the guard, “We combo together, and when the 
linebacker commits, one of us comes off.”
A Jack Me call may also be used, but technically it isn’t a combo block. 
For the Jack Me call, the center tells the guard that the center will go get 
the linebacker. The guard blocks the defensive lineman.
This system works the same down the line with the guard–tackle 
(Queen) and tackle–tight end (King) combination blocks.
Guard–Tackle (Queen) Combination Blocks
The combination block between the guard and the tackle works to the 
linebacker who is lined up outside the guard.
Queen You Call
For the Queen You call (figure 7.3), the tackle should be the post man using 
outside footwork, the same as the guard did to block the 1-technique 
defender on the Jack You call. The tackle takes a short stretch step with 
the outside foot. The second step is down the middle of the defender 
and upfield. This will put the tackle a “half a man” on the defender; the 
tackle’s inside half covers up the defender. The tackle should continue 
to keep a wide base and drive off the line of scrimmage until the line-
backer comes up and forces the tackle to come off the block. The tackle 
now takes the linebacker down the middle, executes a drive block, and 
finishes until the whistle blows.
The guard will be more even on this block than the center was on his 
block because of the alignments on the line of scrimmage. (The center 
is moved up in front of the rest of the offensive line.) The guard should 
take a short stretch step, open his hips 
toward the defender, and with helmet and 
hands, drive the middle of the defender on 
a 45-degree angle, taking over the block. 
The guard finishes the block until the 
whistle blows.

82  Complete Offensive Line
Queen Read Call
Queen Read (figure 7.4) is exactly like Jack Read except the guard is even 
with the tackle. This should be much easier for the guard to execute than 
it was for the center. The guard should use outside footwork to cover up 
the defender. He blocks the level-1 defender off the ball until the line-
backer shows one side or the other. The lineman does not come off on 
the linebacker until both linemen can read 
the linebacker’s jersey numbers. Whoever 
comes off (either the tackle or the guard) 
blocks the linebacker down the middle with 
a drive block and finishes until the whistle.
Queen: guard–tackle combination block
Read: The guard tells the tackle, “We will combo the linebacker 
together.”
The Queen Me call is not technically a combination block. For the 
Queen Me call, the guard tells the tackle that the guard will get the line-
backer. The tackle blocks the level-1 defender.
Tackle–Tight End (King) Combination Blocks
The tackle and tight end work together on the King You and King Read calls.
King You Call
For King You (figure 7.5), the tight end uses outside footwork just like the 
tackle and guard in the Jack and Queen You calls. The tight end covers 
the defender with his inside half. He keeps a wide base and drives the 
defender off the line of scrimmage with the tackle’s help. Once he can 
read the linebacker’s jersey numbers, the tight end is ready to come off 
the combo block and execute a drive block down the middle of the line-
backer until the whistle blows.
The tackle should take a good stretch step with depth in order to get on 
a 45-degree angle to block the defender. He should take the block over so 
the tight end can come off the combo block 
and block the linebacker. The tackle should 
use outside footwork. The aiming points are 
the same as the guard’s and tackle’s aiming 
points on Jack and Queen You blocks.
King: tackle–tight end combination block
You: The tackle tells the tight end, “You go get the linebacker.”

Combination Blocks  83
King Read Call
Most of the time, King Read (figure 7.6) is a combo block used when the 
linebacker is lined up inside the tight end. The tight end should use out-
side footwork just like the guard and tackle in the Jack and Queen combos. 
The tackle uses outside footwork as well, but he covers the defender with 
his outside half, while the tight end covers the defender with his inside 
half. Both should make contact at the same time and drive the defender 
off the line of scrimmage. If the linebacker works over the top to the 
outside, the tackle needs to take over the block as the tight end comes 
off and executes a drive block on the linebacker until the whistle blows.
The biggest mistake is when the tight end comes off too early and leaves 
the tackle stranded. The tight end must not come off until he can read 
both numbers on the linebacker’s jersey. 
The tackle should see the linebacker work 
outside, snap his head across to the middle 
of the defender, and then block him down 
the middle.
King: tackle–tight end combination block
Read: The tackle tells the tight end, “We will combo the linebacker 
together.”
The King Me call isn’t technically a combination block. For the King 
Me call, the tackle tells the tight end that the tackle will get the linebacker. 
The tight end blocks the defensive lineman.
Gap Schemes
All of these calls (Jack, Queen, and King) are used on the inside zone, 
stretch, and option plays when running. The techniques are different, but 
the called assignments stay the same. If the offense is using gap schemes, 
such as the power play or counter play, the same system of calls is in 
effect. Although different techniques and different footwork may be used 
on gap plays, the theory of the system remains the same regarding the 
play-side combinations.
Let’s look at the blocking combinations used on the gap scheme.

Jack Back
Jack Back (figure 7.7) is a double team between the center and the play-
side guard that blocks the nose guard to the backside linebacker.
The center is the post man on this block. His help comes from the right 
guard, so the center should use left footwork on his drive block. The 
center’s job is to get the nose guard up and to be right down the middle 
of him. The play-side guard is the drive man. Using his inside foot, the 
guard steps inside and up, gaining ground on his first step. Staying low, 
he reads the play-side hip of the nose guard and drives his near shoul-
der pad through the defender’s hip; the guard blocks the nose guard 
backside and then works up to the linebacker if the nose guard slants to 
the backside. If the nose guard slants to the guard, the center and guard 
combo block. If both have to stay on the nose guard and no one gets off 
on the linebacker, and if the guard has good control of the nose guard, 
the center will work up and block the linebacker.
Jack: center–guard combination block
Back: The center tells the guard to 
double off to the backside linebacker.
Coaching Point
Sometimes when the guard blocks the nose guard over really well, 
the linebacker will run over the top. In this case, the guard needs 
to snap off and block the linebacker in the direction he wants to go. 
The running back can still cut off this block.
Queen Back
The Queen Back (figure 7.8) double team is between the play-side guard 
and tackle, and it goes to the backside linebacker. In this case, the guard 
usually has a 3-technique defender lined up on him.
The guard uses inside footwork, taking a short stretch step with his 
inside foot. If the 3-technique defender pinches, this will allow a great 
block to the inside. After the short stretch step, the guard moves his 
outside foot down the middle of the defender and covers the defender 
with his outside half.

Figure 7.7  Jack Back call.

Combination Blocks  85
Coaching Point
On this block, the players should use the same technique and foot-
work used on a power step. The defender shouldn’t know if he is 
getting double-teamed or slip blocked.
Now the guard posts the 3-technique defender for the tackle to drive off 
the line of scrimmage. The only time the guard should come off on the line-
backer is if the linebacker fires into the A gap and comes through the inside 
of the guard. If the guard and tackle block the defender so far off the line, 
the guard should be the one to come off on the linebacker. The tackle should 
take a short stretch step with his inside foot and try to stay as square as pos-
sible to the line of scrimmage while blocking the outside hip of the defender.
The linemen want to displace the 3-technique defender first, then worry 
about the linebacker. Once contact is made, the guard’s outside hip and the 
tackle’s inside hip should work together. The 
linemen should stay square and generate the 
most power possible. If the guard and tackle 
are both used on the 3-technique player and 
do not block the linebacker, this is okay.
Queen: guard–tackle combination block
Back: The guard tells the tackle to double off to the backside 
linebacker.
King Back
For the King Back (figure 7.9), the tackle and tight end double the 5-technique 
tackle back to the backside linebacker. The tackle should use the same coach-
ing points just discussed for the guard on the Queen Back, and the tight end 
should do the same as the tackle. Footwork, technique, and aiming points 
are all the same. The major difference in the King Back scheme is that the 
tackle is usually the main blocker who comes off on the backside linebacker 
once the tight end makes contact. The tight end needs to get his helmet to 
the middle of the 5-technique player and 
take over the block. The tight end uses inside 
footwork, drives his helmet and hands to 
the middle of the defender, and drives the 
defender on the angle, usually on the inside.

linebacker.

Jack Mike
The Jack Mike block (figure 7.10) may end up in a double team. It could 
also end up with the center single blocking the nose guard and the guard 
staying square while working up to the Mike linebacker.
Coaching Point
The guard should learn that the A gap between him and the center 
is a canal. The guard needs to take a T-board step to the inside, stay 
square, and go down the canal to the Mike linebacker.
If the Mike linebacker runs over, the guard should turn and block the 
Mike to the outside.
Jack: center–guard combination block
Mike: The center tells the guard to 
double to the Mike linebacker.
Queen Mike
For the Queen Mike (figure 7.11), the guard uses the same technique he 
used on the power slip with inside footwork. When double-teaming to 
the Mike linebacker, the guard should take more of the down lineman; 
the tackle can knock the defensive lineman over to the guard, allowing 
the tackle to get up on the linebacker.
If the Mike linebacker runs under the 
guard into the A gap, then the guard 
comes off on the linebacker, and the tackle 
stays on the defensive lineman. The guard 
and tackle must keep four eyes on the 
linebacker.
Queen: guard–tackle combination block
Mike: The guard tells the tackle to double off to the Mike linebacker.
King Mike
For the King Mike (figure 7.12), the tackle comes off the double team 
only if the Mike linebacker comes through the B gap. The tackle uses 
inside footwork and his power slip techniques. The tackle needs to take 
as much of the defensive lineman as possible. The tight end should knock 
the defensive tackle to the tackle and work up for the middle linebacker.

Learning Combination Blocks
Offensive linemen can learn the various combination blocks by starting 
with the inside zone play versus a 1-technique defender.
