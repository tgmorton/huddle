# Option

Option
Every defensive staff that meets to get ready for an opponent 
asks one question: Does the opponent run the option and, if so, what 
forms of the option do they run? I like to go into a game being able to 
run an option play from all formations. Once your opponent realizes that 
you will run the option, the opponent will cut back much of their twist 
game and secondary blitzes.
The quarterback’s style will dictate just how much option the team 
uses. However, a pure drop-back style quarterback can still run the speed 
option from under center or out of the pistol formation.
Outside Zone
The option game that I prefer uses 
the outside zone scheme. Figure 
10.1 shows how to block for some of 
the tight-end option plays using the 
outside zone scheme versus the four 
common defensive fronts.
The quarterback needs to pitch the 
football off the end man on the line of 
scrimmage, whether it be the defensive 
down lineman, outside linebacker, or 
secondary safety man.
The blocking rules for the offensive line are the same as the rules for 
the outside stretch play because the tight end goes up into the second 
level to block the linebacker.

124  Complete Offensive Line
In the I-formation, the speed option is the base option used to run the 
stretch scheme with the offensive line. The quarterback steps back with 
the foot opposite the direction he is going to run the play. If the option is 
to the right, he steps back with his left foot, replaces with his right, and 
then runs the option, attacking the outside shoulder of the defender at 
the end of the line of scrimmage. The fullback runs an arc release and 
works to block the outside shoulder or leg of the support player. The 
tight end uses an inside release to block the onside inside linebacker. The 
tight end should make sure that he doesn’t get too far inside and knock 
the play-side tackle off his block. The tight end can cheat his split to 3 
feet so that he has room to take an inside stretch step. After he takes his 
stretch step, he works in and out to block the inside linebacker. The tight 
end must work to stay square to the line of scrimmage. The play-side 
tackle should use a stretch reach block on the 5-technique defender. He 
should sell out to reach the defender and should expect no help from the 
tight end. If the tight end can get a tag on the defensive tackle and still 
do his job, he should do it; if not, he should not do it.
Coaching Point
Here’s one thing I’ve learned about option football in nearly 40 years 
of coaching: If the offense blocks the linebackers, the option play will 
gain yardage. This is a big selling point to the offensive line. A lineman 
must do whatever it takes—dive cut, fall, and so on—to get some kind 
of hit on the linebacker. The quarterback and tailback can also execute 
a counter action in the backfield in order to hold the linebackers.
If the offense uses a pistol formation or under center with one back, 
the blocking scheme is still the same for the offensive line.
The tight end has a rule that if he gets 
man on man outside, as shown in figure 
10.2, he must block man on. The tight end 
should make the call to the tackle and 
guard, letting them know that they have a 
three-man game. This should be the same 
call that is made on the stretch boss play. 
The defense will often use various schemes 
off the edges to try to confuse the quarter-
back. The tight end and tackle have to be 
coordinated so they can make the right 
calls to block whatever blitz or front the 
defense may show.

Option to the Tight-End Side 
Versus an Even 40 Front
Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show two different 
schemes versus an over defense with a 
7-technique defensive end. If the defen-
sive end is a very good player, the offense 
should take him out of the game by King 
blocking him. This is the same scheme 
used on the stretch boss play from the 
stretch outside zone play. Blocking rules 
are the same as the rules for the stretch 
boss scheme versus 40 defense.
Even though the center declared the 
Mike linebacker backside and the back-
side tackle could lock down his block on 
the defensive end, I prefer to zone the 
linebacker through the B gap and secure 
the backside weak A gap and weak B gap 
against blitzes and run-throughs.
If the defensive end is a big, slow 
player, the offense can use the loop 
scheme to the free safety and pitch off 
the slower defender who is not used to 
playing the quarterback. The play-side 
tackle on the tight-end side has to use a split-side technique of in and out 
to block the first play-side linebacker. This scheme is particularly useful 
if the quarterback is not a great runner. It helps to get the ball out of the 
quarterback’s hands much more quickly. If an offense uses the option a 
lot and mixes in both schemes of looping the tight end and King blocking 
the box, this really makes it tough on the defensive front.
If there is movement up front, the tight end and tackle will King the 
box and pick up all blitzes. I have the offense work against two different 
slants with the defense in an even front: 2-gap slants (figure 10.5a) and 
1-gap slants (figure 10.5b) on the fire zone series of blitzes. The 1-gap 
slants are simple blitzes and shouldn’t be a problem to pick up. The 2-gap 
fire zone blitzes are the ones that require the most work.

Coaching Point
Here’s an important coaching point for the play-side tight end, tackle, 
and guard: Whoever gets to level 2 and blocks the play-side line-
backer first will allow the other blocker (either the tackle or guard) 
to continue on to level 3 and block the free safety.
Option Versus the 4-3 Defense
If the tight end is facing a 9-technique defensive end, the tight end 
needs to work the in-and-out technique on the linebacker. The play-side 
tackle should come off with the outside foot but should focus on execut-
ing a deuce-tag technique with the play-side guard to make sure the 
3-technique defender gets no penetration (figure 
10.6). Everyone else on the line blocks the stretch 
play. The play-side guard and tackle must block 
the 3-technique player as much as possible. If 
the offense has to waste a double team on the 
3-technique player and the tackle doesn’t get off 
to the linebacker, this is better than forcing the 
quarterback to pitch off the 3-technique player.
If the defensive end lines up in a 6 or 7 technique on the tight end, the 
tight end should make a King call to the tackle, King the box, and let the 
quarterback pitch off the secondary support player. Another option is 
using the loop technique on the 6-technique defender and then pitching 
off the 6-technique defender.
Option Versus the Under Front
On the option versus an under front, blocking assignments are the same 
as on stretch boss to the tight-end side versus an under front. For blocking 
the under front, the coach must know whether his center can block the 
shaded nose guard and not allow penetration on the play. If the center 
is having a problem with the wide shade or gap player, the offense can 
put the ricochet technique into effect and ricochet the nose guard. The 
backside guard has to judge the alignment of the backside linebacker. 
He must decide whether to shoot through and get the linebacker, leaving 
the backside tackle singled on the 3-technique defender.

Option Versus the Bear Defense
When defensive coaches jump to the bear defense and give a steady dose 
of this up front, the first thing the offense should try is the speed option. 
It goes back to the old philosophy that 
if the defense puts them all inside, the 
offense wants to run the football outside 
(figure 10.8). The tight end will usually 
have a man-on-man outside rule in 
effect versus this bear front.
When blocking the bear front on the speed option, the offense uses 
a triple blocking scheme from the center to the backside tackle. This 
allows the center to cover the front-side A gap on the stretch scheme. 
If the 3-technique defender pinches to the inside, the A gap is covered.
If any kind of 6- or 7-technique defender is lined up on the tight end, 
the tight end needs to King the box. The offense must always cover the 
front-side A, B, and C gaps while letting the quarterback cleanly get 
down the line of scrimmage to the pitchman.
The options on the split-end side have one rule. First, the offense should 
try to run to the numbers. If everything else is even, the offense should 
try to run to the deepest linebackers.
Figure 10.9a shows the deepest linebacker aligned in the play-side A 
gap. The play-side tackle has a great chance to get in and get this backer. 
In figure 10.9b, the backer is in the B gap. This is a very tough get for the 
tackle. Most of the time, a crackback block on the linebacker by a wide 
receiver is used to get the B-gap linebacker.

front blocked like 50 defense.
The front side of the under front is 
blocked just like the Okie, or 50 defense 
(figure 10.7). The rest of the line blocks 
the stretch play.

Another technique that can be used if the defensive ends are playing 
wide is to have the tackle step with the outside foot like a reach but then 
come off inside the defensive end for the inside linebacker. This is called 
the fake reach block. The tackle should go up hard inside and block the 
linebacker.
The tackle needs to make a call to the guard and center to let them 
know that the tackle is coming inside to get the linebacker. Once this 
call is made, the guard can combo off the A-gap player and work off to 
the backside linebacker. On the backside, the guard can handle it two 
ways: slip through to the linebacker (figure 10.10a) or man it up and lock 
down the backside (figure 10.10b). A potential problem when locking it 
down is the weak linebacker run-through. Locking the backside keeps 
the defensive end from chasing, but it frees the weak A gap. I like to use 
the slip option and handle the defensive end with reverses and nakeds.
Man on Man Outside
The odd stack is a very tough defense against 
the speed option because of the bad angles 
on the front side as the blockers try to get up 
to the linebackers (figure 10.11). The offense 
has to block the 5-technique defender and 
hope to pitch off the scrape linebacker. When 
the offense does this, the play really starts to 
get strung out, and the quarterback usually 
dips up inside the B gap.
A great scheme to counter the 3-3 stack 
defense is the X blocking scheme on the 
option. The play-side tackle veer blocks 
the B gap, stopping all linebacker run-throughs, and blocks the middle 
linebacker. The play-side guard loops to the outside of the 5-technique 
defensive tackle and blocks the play-side Sam linebacker. This forces the 
5-technique defensive tackle to play the quarterback.

Option  129
A base adjustment to the odd stack is to get in a three-by-one set and try 
to pull the defense to the side with the three receivers. The offense should 
get more of a conventional Okie 50 defensive front and should run the 
option out the weak side. The three wide receivers force the defense to 
pull the linebackers to the outside to cover. If the defense chooses to leave 
the linebacker in the box, the offense should be throwing the football.
Summary
The option is by far the most worked-on play by a defense. For the offense, 
the option is great out of all formations, and it forces the defense to be 
perfect in their assignments. This leads into the chapter on pass protec-
tion. Protection and drills for improving skills in this area will be fully 
covered in the next chapter.
