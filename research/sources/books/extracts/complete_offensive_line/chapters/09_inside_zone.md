Inside Zone Center–Guard Combinations: 1 and 2 Techniques
The offensive linemen should start learning this blocking combination 
by working against just a defensive lineman and no linebacker (figure 
7.13). The linemen need to understand how 
important it is to take care of level 1.
More often than not, players want to go to 
level 2 too fast. This results in short yardage 
or loss of yardage. If the offense takes care 
of level 1, they will always gain yardage.
The guards are really deep off the foot-
ball. For the timing of this combination 
block to be effective, the guard must come 
off the football hard. The guard’s footwork is outside foot over and up as on 
the step for a drive block. He should get the second step down as quickly 
as possible and be ready to make contact with the inside foot and inside 
shoulder. The guard may use his forearms or his hands to deliver the blow.
Coaching Point
The phrase “same foot, same shoulder” applies to these combination 
blocks. A lineman never wants to hit one shoulder and opposite foot 
on any block. He should always hit same foot, same shoulder. This 
delivers power and thrust through the defender.
The center should snap the football and take a stretch step to get started 
on his proper angle. The wider the defender, the deeper the drop. The 
center may use a forearm flipper or his hands on contact. I prefer that 
players use the hands. The offensive lineman should feel the defender 
and try to gain some control by using his hands. Sometimes using the

forearm provides very little control. The center’s aiming point is the 
defender’s near number.
When the guard is covered, it is his job to get leverage and post the 
defender. The uncovered man’s job is to get movement and push the 
defender back to level 2. After a few days of working on blocking the 
level-1 defender, add the linebacker into the drill.
On the double team, a big problem occurs when one of the blockers 
comes off too early to block the linebacker. I coach four hands on the 
defender, four eyes on the linebacker. When the blocker can read both 
of the linebacker’s numbers, that means 
the linebacker is committed to the play 
side, so the blocker needs to come off the 
down block (figure 7.14). I have one stan-
dard rule: If there is any doubt, the blocker 
should not come off and should stay on the 
level-1 double team.
The principles for all covered linemen 
are the same:
• Bring the outside foot over and up (short stretch).
• Use the inside foot and inside shoulder.
• Get the step down quickly.
• Maintain your base.
• Aim at the defender’s outside breast.
• Drive the defender with two hands on the defender and two eyes 
on the linebacker.
• If the linebacker commits outside, take him; if not, stay on the 
down lineman.
Uncovered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step with the play-side foot.
• Get the second step down quickly.
• Never cross over the feet.
• Keep your base.
• Take the third step when contact is made with the play-side foot 
and play-side shoulder.
• Aim at the defender’s inside breast.
• If the linebacker goes outside, work your head across and take 
over the down lineman.

it’s time to come off and block

Combination Blocks  89
The uncovered man’s steps should be one, quick, two, three with 
contact on the third step. A 1 and 2 technique are treated the same. With 
a 2, 4, or 6 head-up technique, the lineman should expect movement. In 
these situations, we call “Jack, Queen, King, You.” If the head-up defender 
steps out, it goes to “Jack, Queen, King, Me.”
Once the offensive lineman comes off to the linebacker, each of these 
situations may be different depending on how the linebacker decides to 
play. If the linebacker attacks the line of scrimmage, the lineman should 
try to get his head across to the defender’s far number—or at least to 
his near number—and execute a drive block. The lineman should move 
his feet and try to move the defender wherever he can. If the linebacker 
sits, the lineman should come off and hit him square down the middle, 
then perform the perfect drive block.
Inside Zone Versus 3, 5, and 9 Techniques
When an offensive lineman has the outside shades, success comes down 
to base blocking unless the lineman gets movement when the defender 
slants or angles inside.
All covered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step.
• Execute a tight reach block.
• Aim at the defender’s outside breast to armpit.
• Block on the angle.
Uncovered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step (inside zone) and never cross over your feet.
• Block the linebacker from outside breast to armpit, moving the 
linebacker down the middle.
• Always expect a spike by the defender aligned in a 3, 5, or 9 
technique.
Backside Combination Blocks, Inside Zone
Backside blocking combinations are based on the same principles as the 
front side. On the backside, a buzzword is used for the center and back-
side guard working together. Buzzwords are also used for the backside 
guard and tackle and the backside tackle and tight end.
For example, the buzzword Scoop may be used for the center and 
backside guard; that is a very standard call. Slip could refer to the guard 
and tackle, and Slide to the tackle and tight end.

90  Complete Offensive Line
For a zone blocking run scheme, the center and backside guard combo 
block the defender to the backside linebacker (figure 7.15). The center 
uses play-side footwork and gets his backside half on the nose guard 
to lift him from the backside guard. The backside guard takes a zone 
step to the play side; he blocks the defender with his helmet to the far 
number using the right-arm strong technique and then takes over the 
defender. This is the Scoop Back blocking scheme to get the nose guard 
and backside linebacker blocked.
The center should zone up to block the backside linebacker with his 
helmet on the play-side number. He must not look at the linebacker or 
his helmet will go backside on the block every time! The center leads 
the linebacker a couple yards and then blocks him. He stays square to 
the line of scrimmage.
Scoop: center–backside guard combi-
nation block
Back: The center tells the guard that 
the center is going for the backside 
linebacker.
For a Scoop You call (figure 7.16), the You call tells the backside guard 
to zone up and block the linebacker. The center will execute a reach block 
on the nose guard.
Scoop: center–backside guard combi-
nation block
You: The center tells the backside 
guard, “You go get the backside 
linebacker.”
On the power slip block between the backside guard and tackle (figure 
7.17), the guard uses inside footwork and lifts the defender with the out-
side half of his body. The backside tackle uses a stretch step and aims for 
the far numbers of the defender with a strong-arm technique (play-side 
arm); he then takes over the defender. The guard should work up and 
block the backside linebacker on his play-side number.
Slip: backside guard–tackle combina-
tion block
Me: The guard tells the tackle that the 
guard will get the linebacker.

Combination Blocks  91
The Slip You call (figure 7.18) tells the tackle to zone up and block the 
backside linebacker on his play-side number. The guard uses an 18-inch 
cutoff technique on the 1-technique defender. The Slip You is a block in 
which the backside tackle and tight end combo off the defensive lineman 
up to the backside linebacker. The tackle uses inside footwork and, as 
with the center and guard, lifts the defender for the tight end with the 
outside half of his body. The tight end steps inside with a zone step and 
works for the far number of the defender, using a strong inside arm to 
overtake the defender.
Slip: backside guard–tackle combina-
tion block
You: The backside guard tells the 
tackle to go get the linebacker.
The Slide Me call (figure 7.19) tells the tight end that the backside 
tackle will go block the backside linebacker. The tight end then blocks 
the defensive lineman.
Slide: backside tackle–tight end com-
bination block
Me: The backside tackle tells the tight 
end, “I will go get the linebacker.”
The Slide You call (figure 7.20) tells the 
tight end to go block the backside linebacker on his play-side number. 
The tackle uses an 18-inch cutoff block on the defensive lineman.
Slide: backside tackle–tight end com-
bination block
You: The backside tackle tells the tight 
end to go get the linebacker.
Blocking With an Outside Head-Up Technique
For the inside zone play, the covered lineman will use more of a power 
combination block with the uncovered lineman. This means they block 
more of the defender, trying to get at least one-half to three-quarters of 
the defender covered up on the post.

92  Complete Offensive Line
The covered lineman uses these techniques:
• Take a stretch step with the play-side foot.
• Do not cross over your feet.
• Make contact with the outside shoulder and leg (same foot, same 
shoulder).
• Block the inside half of the defender.
• Get leverage and stay square.
• Keep two eyes on the linebacker.
• Do not let your inside (play-side) hand get involved in the block.
• Stay on the down lineman until the linebacker takes you off the 
block and you can read both of the linebacker’s numbers.
The uncovered lineman uses these techniques:
• Take a stretch step with the play-side foot; give a little ground to 
get a good angle on the defender.
• Aim your second step at a point behind the defender’s outside foot.
• Work to take the defender over at the aiming point of his inside 
breast.
• Stay low and work for inside hand leverage.
• Work your angle to the line of scrimmage and stay as square as 
possible.
Coaching Point
Any time the guard is covered and the backside tackle is uncovered, 
no matter the technique of the defenders, the backside tackle works 
with the guard to block the defender up to the linebacker. This goes 
back to covered, uncovered principles of who each lineman works 
with in zone blocking.
Blocking With an Inside Technique  
Away From an Uncovered Lineman
In this situation, we still have zone blocking principles in place, taking 
the zone steps to the play side. When the techniques are away, like on an 
inside shade, the offensive linemen basically end up with man blocking. 

Combination Blocks  93
The guard blocks man to man on the 1-technique defender, using an 
18-inch cutoff block. The backside tackle uses a zone step and then goes 
up to block man to man on the linebacker.
The covered linemen follow these principles:
• Execute a cutoff block to the play side.
• Work to get square to the line of scrimmage.
The uncovered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step (inside zone) and never cross over your feet.
• Block the linebacker’s inside breast to armpit; if the linebacker is 
moving, block him and then adjust and block down the middle or 
backside number.
• Always expect a spike by the inside-shaded defender.
Summary
This chapter covered all of the calls play side and backside on zone and 
gap blocking combinations. For combo blocks, a lineman must know 
who he works with and the techniques required. For successful zone 
blocking, players must know the post man and drive man on double 
teams, as well as who is covered and uncovered. This information will 
be beneficial in understanding chapter 8, which covers the stretch play 
and outside zone blocking scheme.
