# Stretch Plays

Stretch Plays
The stretch plays covered in this chapter will explain all the dif-
ferent defensive fronts you will be asked to block. We will explain the 
1-2 reads on each front that you block, that the running back should be 
reading as he runs the football. All blocks, such as the read, cutoff, and 
slips, will be covered in length.
Stretch Plays to the Tight-End Side
The stretch play using an outside zone blocking scheme is my number 
one running play, and this blocking scheme may also be used on numer-
ous other running plays. The option play can be run to the tight-end side 
and split side. Both use stretch zone blocking. The only difference is that 
the offense does not block the end man on the line of scrimmage. The 
option game will be covered in chapter 10. The speed sweep, toss sweep, 
and base stretch play use the outside zone scheme.
The guards should maintain base splits at a foot and a half. The tack-
les and tight ends should use a tight two-foot split so the inside blocker 
does not get hung out to dry. The tackles and tight ends must learn not 
to oversplit; if they oversplit and a three-man game call is made, the 
lineman in the middle is really in trouble.
Obviously, the goal of the stretch play is to get the football to the out-
side of the defense. The more the defense is stretched, the more seams 
will likely be created. The goal is to get the front side of the defense 
moving hard laterally while the backside offensive linemen make great 
cutoff blocks on the backside. This will separate the defense, opening 
the desired seams.

Coaching Point
For the stretch play, the running backs and linemen must be on the 
same page. The running backs coach and offensive line coach have 
to speak the same language. Sometimes egos get involved, so I 
prefer to have the offensive line coach put in the play and coach all 
positions on the running of the play. This way, the running backs, tight 
ends, wide receivers, and offensive line are totally on the same page.
In this section, we look at stretch plays to the tight-end side versus 
four defensive fronts. The play is shown with all 11 players; we discuss 
the assignments for the running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends. 
Then we concentrate on the offensive line. Figure 8.1 shows the stretch 
play to the tight-end side against an odd defense.

Stretch Plays  97
The tailback is 7 yards deep in a two-point stance. (If the running back 
is very quick, he could move to 8 yards deep.) His aiming point is the 
butt of the play-side tight end or imaginary tight end. He must stay on 
track. The quarterback’s job is to get the football to the tailback. The full-
back can be used as a backside cut blocker or a front-side force blocker, 
depending on the call and the defensive front.
The wide receivers must take a maximum split. If the ball is in the 
middle of the field, both receivers will split to the top of the numbers 
(college). They block force defenders. If they have any doubt, they block 
the safeties.
Offensive Line Blocking Versus Odd Fronts and Variations
The play-side tackle and tight end 
must get the outside linebacker 
and the number 1 read moving as 
quickly as possible (figure 8.2). The 
faster the number 1 read moves, 
the quicker the running back gets 
his first read. Now his eye can 
go back to his second read. If the 
number 1 read works outside and 
the number 2 read gets reached, the 
ball should go in the B gap.
These are the assignments that 
the offensive line must execute on 
the stretch play to the tight-end side:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch run, track to linebacker
Center: stretch block play-side A gap (scoop back)
Backside guard: stretch backside AW gap (scoop back)
Backside tackle: cutoff block
The tackle and tight end execute reach blocks. They get the first read 
and run hard, working the outside arm and leg strong. The guard always 
expects a pinch from the 5- or 4-technique defender. On stretch plays, 
the center stretches and rips and works to the front-side linebacker to get 
the backside linebacker. The backside guard pulls and overtakes, while 
the backside tackle uses a great 18-inch cutoff block with the inside arm 
strong. The cutoff block is the key to the success of the play.

Figure 8.2  Outside stretch play when 
number 1 read works outside and number 
2 read gets reached. The most important 
block of all five linemen is the cutoff block 
on the backside, which is executed by the 
backside tackle in this case.

98  Complete Offensive Line
If the number 1 read pinches to the 
inside (figure 8.3), the running back auto-
matically takes the football into the C gap. 
The running back makes one cut and puts 
the football north and south. The offensive 
linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block; squeeze off pinch 
block to linebacker’s outside number
Guard: stretch to overtake (pinch 5 
technique), head across
Center: stretch play-side A gap slip off 
slant nose guard to backside linebacker
Backside guard: stretch and overtake nose guard, head across (cut 
block)
Backside tackle: 18-inch cutoff block
The play-side tackle should try not to overreach the defensive tackle 
because this puts a lot of pressure on the uncovered guard to overtake 
the pinch defender. The tackle should work through the outside breast 
to armpit and squeeze off the defender on his way to the linebacker. He 
should try to stay as square as possible. The backside guard should be 
ready to get his head across the nose guard and cut block his far leg. 
If the center comes off clean and thinks he has position, he executes a 
cut block on the backside linebacker. (The center should not look at the 
linebacker; he should lead him.)
Coaching Point
A big kid who has trouble cut blocking should stay high and cover 
up the linebacker. A coach shouldn’t ask a player to do something 
that his body won’t let him do.

ered lineman works play side, the

Stretch Plays  99
When the number 1 read runs 
hard to the outside (figure 8.4), the 
center is hooked up, and the number 
2 read is coming hard to the outside, 
the running back should cut off the 
backside of the number 2 read. Theo-
retically, this will put the football in 
the backside weak A gap. When the 
defense flows hard, this cut will still 
happen out around the play-side 
tackle and tight-end area.
Coaching Point
On the front side, linemen must be sure to maintain helmet place-
ment and stay on their feet. The backside cutoff block by the back-
side tackle is the most important block. The coach has to sell this 
to his players. I tell our players that all five offensive linemen are at 
the point of attack.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch run at an angle to the linebacker
Center: scoop back to lock up nose guard; maintain helmet place-
ment
Backside guard: scoop, run track to linebacker
Backside tackle: cutoff block
Fast-flow linebackers can be a problem for the center, guard, tackle, or 
tight end, especially if the offensive player doesn’t abandon his partner 
on the squeeze-off. When the lineman comes off and the linebacker is 
running hard to the outside, the lineman should lock onto the linebacker’s 
backside number and drive him to the sidelines.

100  Complete Offensive Line
When the outside linebacker in an odd 
front lines up in a head-up position toe to 
toe with the tight end, he now becomes 
the number 1 read (figure 8.5). When this 
occurs, we make a three-man game call that 
tells the guard, tackle, and tight end that we 
are taking the zone out to the tight end at this point. As long as the tight 
end is facing a 9 technique or outside technique, he is by himself, and the 
zone stops at the tackle. When the linebacker goes to a 6 or 7 technique, 
he becomes the number 1 read.
Stretch Play Versus Under Defensive Front
We try to keep this play simple even though the Mike linebacker is strong 
side and it is a member of the stack family. We treat the front side of this 
play as an odd front and block it accordingly (figure 8.6). The number 1 
and number 2 reads remain the same, and the running back treats the 
play that way.

Figure 8.5  6 call.
Against the under front, the offense should expect faster flow to the 
tight-end side because the defense is already shifted in that direction. 
Backside is where some adjustments need to be made. The backside 
guard needs to read the placement of the Will linebacker and adjust his 
path accordingly. He should make a 
call to the tackle if the linebacker is 
inside heavy into the AW gap. This call 
tells the tackle, “I’m out of here, and 
you have no help, so take the defen-
sive tackle by yourself.” At this time, 
the tackle needs to pull and overtake 
(figure 8.7).

Stretch Plays  101
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch run track to linebacker
Center: reach block
Backside guard: slip or make call to be free and go get linebacker
Backside tackle: slip or pull and overtake
When the offense faces an under G look 
(figure 8.8), everything is the same for 
everyone except the play-side guard and 
center. A call of Jack You is still used, but 
because this is the outside zone scheme, the 
guard will use a ricochet technique to get to 
the linebacker.
On a ricochet call, the center must know 
that he needs to take the 1- or 2-technique 
defender as if he has no help. The guard 
will stretch step and tag the 1-technique 
defender with his inside hand. He must 
then shuffle skate down the line of scrim-
mage, getting no depth and staying square 
until he gets outside helmet placement on 
the linebacker (figure 8.9). This technique 
takes a lot of practice, but once the player 
can do it—and the center gets the 1- or 
2-technique player cut off—the opponent 
has no defense.
Stretch Play Versus 4-3 Stack 
Defense
If the number 1 read works outside and 
the number 2 read gets reached, the ball 
goes into the B gap (figure 8.10). This play 
involves nothing more than reach and 
cutoff blocks with the uncovered lineman 
stretching and running good tracks to the 
linebacker.

102  Complete Offensive Line
Now if the number 1 read goes inside, 
the football goes outside to the D gap. All 
of the uncovered linemen should expect a 
pinch from the covered man they are work-
ing toward. The number 1 read goes inside, 
and the ball goes outside (figure 8.11).
If the number 1 read works hard out-
side and the number 2 read runs hard to 
the outside, the running back cuts back 
behind the number 2 read in the A gap 
(figure 8.12). This should also happen in 
the tackle–tight end area on the line of 
scrimmage.
The offensive linemen execute their 
assignments:
Tight end: reach block, squeeze climb 
for Sam linebacker
Tackle: stretch run track to linebacker; 
expect pinch from number 1 read
Guard: reach block, pinch climb for 
Mike linebacker
Center: stretch run track to Mike linebacker; expect pinch from 
number 2 read
Backside guard: 18-inch cutoff block
Backside tackle: slip with guard, run track to Will linebacker, expect 
1-technique defender to loop outside
Against a shaded nose guard, the center has to give a “go” call to the 
backside guard so the guard can pull and overtake the shaded nose guard 
(figure 8.13a). The play-side tackle and tight end execute a King You call 
to the Sam linebacker. If the Sam linebacker flows (figure 8.13b), the fast-
flow linebacker technique should be put into effect. The tight end runs 
the linebacker to the sideline.

Stretch Play Versus Even-Front Defense
When the defense shows an eight-man front (figure 8.14), the offense 
needs to know if they are blocking it with a force blocker or with the 
tight end handling the number 4 player. If boss blocking the number 
4 defender, then the tight end and tackle will work a King call on the 
box players. The offense should focus more on getting the ball outside, 
especially if the defensive end is in a 6 or 7 technique.

Figure 8.17  Center, guard,

Another technique is to have the 
tackle and tight end fan block to the 
strong safety and let the fullback go 
inside the number 1 read to get the 
linebacker (figure 8.15). On this call, the 
tailback should know that the number 
1 read is being taken to the outside so 
the ball goes to the B gap. If the number 
2 read runs hard, the ball will go back 
to the play-side A gap.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: combo block with tackle (King call) to the strong safety 
(number 4 read)
Tackle: stretch and combo block (King call) the 6- or 7-technique defender
Guard: reach block
Center: if two backs in the backfield, stretch the A gap strong for the 
play-side linebacker to the backside linebacker; if one back in the 
backfield, get the front-side linebacker
Backside guard: 18-inch cutoff block
Backside tackle: guard covered slip with backside guard and run 
track to the backside linebacker
With a six-man box and the tight end staying in the box to block, 
the backside tackle can lock the backside on the defensive end (figure 
8.16). The backside tackle still needs to stop the linebacker from running 
through the backside B gap.
The main problem against an eight-man front defense is the pinch of 
the 6- or 7-technique defender to the B gap when the offense has one 
back in the backfield (figure 8.17). This defensive pinch forces the use of

a three-man game to the play side. We work on this blitz every day in 
practice. This is the first defensive tactic I study on Sunday night when 
scouting an upcoming opponent. I study all of these pinches, one after 
another, to try to find a tip-off or giveaway.
The key is that the play-side tackle doesn’t hang out the guard by 
overreaching. The tackle needs to stretch and stay square to the line of 
scrimmage as much as possible. A natural running lane will open up if 
the offense picks up the play-side linebacker. We’ve had some really long 
runs off this pinch when it’s been blocked properly.
Stretch Plays to the Split-End Side
The stretch play to the split-end side has some very different looks that 
must be handled differently. With the new trend of spread offenses and 
the pro influence of the one-back set, the split-side running game has 
really evolved. The split-side game is very simple; if there are three 
defenders and three blockers, this will enable the offense to use the run. 
The phrase “angle, numbers, grass” is used to judge where to run the 
football. The offense will use the same “number 1 to number 2 read” 
philosophy in the running game but from a lot of different sets in the 
backfield.
Here is a simple example of how running 
backs learn this philosophy. In figure 8.18, the 
one-back stretch play is being run to the ghost 
tight ends but with the junction point of the 
handoff shown from under center. The quar-
terback and running back (dotted in) are out 
of the spread set. Based on the philosophy of 
the spread, the running back needs to know 
what the number 1 read is doing by the time 
he takes the football from the quarterback. The 
running back needs to press the junction point 
of the underneath handoff before he makes his 
one cut off the read of the number 2 defender.

point out of the I-formation.

106  Complete Offensive Line
A common error that a running back makes in the shotgun is want-
ing to bend to the line of scrimmage as soon as he touches the football 
when coming across. This creates a number of 
problems for him and the offensive line that 
cannot be fixed.
The base alignments and splits on the line 
of scrimmage stay the same: 18 inches for the 
guards and tight 2-foot splits for the tackles. 
The running backs align with their toes 5 
yards deep and shoe to shoe with the offensive 
tackle. The quarterback lines up with his toes 
on the heels of the running back (figure 8.19).
Coaching Point
Do not assign the quarterback a depth for his feet. The quarterback 
has enough to do with getting everyone lined up. The running backs 
are responsible for setting the backfield and getting the alignment 
right. If the running back messes up and sets his depth at 5 1/2 yards 
deep, the quarterback still needs to align his toes behind the heels 
of the running back.
This alignment allows the running back to come straight across; he 
will not have to veer or get off course to get to his junction point. The 
running back should be able to go from the left halfback spot to the right 
halfback spot without any problem. If the quarterback aligns toe to toe 
with the running back, the running back will get pushed into the line of 
scrimmage, and all of the running back’s cuts will be difficult.
If aligned in the pistol formation, the running back’s depth is 7 1/2 
to 8 yards. The quarterback aligns his toes at 4 yards deep. The running 
back’s angle and aiming point 
are the same as those out of the 
I-formation.
Now let’s look at how to block 
these split-side plays versus the 
four fronts as previously dis-
cussed for the tight-end side. The 
backfield set has no correlation 
with the blocking performed up 
front (figure 8.20).

Stretch Plays  107
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch step, run track to linebacker
Center: scoop to backside linebacker
Backside guard: scoop for nose guard to backside linebacker
Backside tackle: slide call to tight end versus 5 technique, work up 
to strong safety
Tight end: slide call, work with tackle
To run the stretch play, the offense must be aware of the numbers they 
have to the split-end side. Against the odd front, a fullback or halfback 
must block the outside linebacker.
If the offense is in a one-back set versus this front, the play would have 
to be checked off and then go to the tight-end side. A wide receiver could 
be motioned across to block the outside linebacker, but the best strategy 
is to just check the play and go to the tight-end side.
All the blocking rules for the offensive line are the same for the split 
side.
If the fullback is offset, he will handle 
his blocking path just like he would in the 
shotgun. The fullback needs to take a 6-inch 
stretch step to the outside and then attack the 
defender as his aiming point (figure 8.21). 
The fullback should try to block him on his 
side of the line of scrimmage. He should use 
a cut block as a last resort.
Coaching Point
One spring we noticed that, especially out of the pistol set, the 
running back’s path to the split side was tighter. The running backs 
weren’t going to the ghost tight-end spot. After studying this, we 
determined that the majority of the time the defensive end would 
play hard outside. With this being the case, we started using the 
defender as the aiming point. This strategy makes that inside cut 
happen quicker and easier. Besides, if the defender pinches, it’s 
easier for the running back to get outside than to get back inside.

Blocking the Stretch Play to the Split-End Side  
Versus the Under Front
Versus the under front, the stretch play to the 
split side is very different from the stretch 
play to the tight-end side. Even when the 
numbers are right with three on three, the 
offense must still be able to get the center to 
the play-side linebacker. The “go” call (figure 
8.23) comes into effect for the backside guard 
to take the nose guard while the center is 
working to the play-side linebacker.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: reach block, call from center to say “we are working 
together”
Center: call for guards to help work to the front-side linebacker
Backside guard: call from center to take the nose guard
Backside tackle: cutoff block or slide call
Tight end: cutoff block or slide call
Treat the split side of the under front like a 40 defense. The center 
should work to the front-side linebacker. The center must know if he has 
a fullback or not for the purpose of Mike declaration.
I have avoided the Mike declaration because in a fast-paced, no-huddle 
offense, there is not enough time to make a Mike call before blocking 
the front. On some teams, the quarterback calls the Mike, and on other 
teams the center calls out the Mike linebacker. The Mike declaration is a 
situation that each team needs to work to its best benefit.

In figure 8.22, note how the I-formation 
stretch play and the shotgun split-back play 
are coordinated. Half of the time, the offen-
sive line does not know if the backfield set is 
the I or split-back formation.

Coaching Point
On the 40 look, the center and guard handle all of the A- and B-gap 
stunts. The fullback never goes into the A gap to get a defender. 
Instead, he reads his way to the B, C, or D gap to get to the linebacker.
The center needs to make a call to the 
guards, letting them know that he is work-
ing with the front-side guard (figure 8.24). 
The center treats the front like an even or 40 
defense.
Previously, we would scoop the front back, 
but this strategy left the front-side (A) gap 
open for the linebacker to run through. Now 
we make a call to put the center on the play 
side with the guard. The backside tackle and 
tight end must be brought along to handle 
the defensive tackle and linebacker. Figure 
8.25 is a scheme used on the weak-side lead 
play, a form of zone blocking.
For some defenses, a big blitz off the boundary side is the weak corner 
fire. To predict this stunt, the offensive team must rely heavily on film 
study. This scheme needs to be worked every day during fundamentals. 
Once the backside guard is involved, it becomes a four-man game. The 
wide receiver and fullback should swap assignments if the weak corner 
beats the wide receiver inside (figure 8.26). In a one-back set, the quar-
terback should check out of the play. The speed option is a great play to 
check into and run because the line blocking is exactly the same, letting 
the quarterback pitch off the weak corner.

One of the toughest things to do is run the play when the wide receiver 
is in no position to make his block (figure 8.27). The tackle moves out to 
the weak safety on the line of scrimmage and lets the receiver go hard 
down inside to get the linebacker. This is about the only way to handle 
this without getting the running back killed.

Figure 8.28 shows an example of the stretch play being called to the 
right side of the offense. The extra defender forced the play to be checked 
to the other side. The quarterback can check the play to the other side 
and run the stretch play himself. Now the running back, who originally 
had the call of ballcarrier, is the lead blocker.
The offensive line must complete these assignments:
Tackle: read block
Guard: zone B gap to linebacker
Center: reach nose guard
Backside guard: slip to linebacker
Backside tackle: pull over to tackle the 3-technique defender
Tight end: cutoff man on (if a tight end is used)

Stretch Plays  111
Stretch Play Versus 4-3 Stack Defense
The stretch play versus the 4-3 defense to the 
split-end side (figure 8.29) can be run with 
two different blocking schemes. First, the 
center and play-side guard can combo the 
nose guard to the middle linebacker. Second, 
the center and guard can block the nose 
guard to the Will linebacker, and the fullback 
will take the Mike linebacker. (The play-side 
guard uses an “ass pat” to tell the fullback 
that the guard will take the Will and that the 
fullback should take the Mike. Basically, they 
are changing assignments.)
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: Jack Will call, ass-pat signal to the fullback
Center: Jack Will call, nose guard to Will
Backside guard: slip call to Sam linebacker
Backside tackle: slip call with the guard
Tight end: 18-inch cutoff block
Run to Split-End Side Versus the Seven-Man Box
A blocker from the backfield is needed on this play. The blocking back 
needs to take a short stretch step and still run at the defensive end. He 
then works up for the linebacker. This will prevent the linebacker from 
taking an isolation fill on the blocking back 
and will buy some time.
The blocking back’s aiming point of the 
defensive end also allows him to have easy 
access to the outside on a pinching defender. 
The play-side tackle has the defensive end 
man on man (figure 8.30), if the tackle doesn’t 
call the guard over to him. The center and 
guard make a Jack Mike call. If the tackle 
makes a call for the guard to come help him, 
the Jack Mike call is off. The tackle’s call has 
priority.

When the tackle calls the guard over 
(figure 8.31), the tackle can really help 
the guard because he is now respon-
sible for the Mike linebacker. If the Will 
linebacker hits the tackle in the face, the 
tackle must block the Will linebacker. 
The fullback will adjust and take the 
Mike linebacker.

Split-Side Stretch Play Versus Even Front
When using an offense with four 
wide receivers, the team will some-
times have to bring a wide receiver 
across the formation to block the 
number 4 defender (figure 8.32) 
and get inside-out position on the 
defender. On a one-back run play, the 
offensive line can block only three on 
the play side.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: Jack You call, ricochet technique
Center: Jack You call, 1 technique
Backside guard: slip or call “gone” to tackle
Backside tackle: slip, pull, and overtake; “gone” call
Tight end: 18-inch cutoff block
Six-Man Box
The offense should be able to run all day. The basic rule is to run to the 
A-gap player based on how the players are blocking their personnel. 
If the right guard is better than the opponent’s 3-technique player, the 
offense should run to that side. However, the team should not get locked 
in to rules. If one or two linemen say they are better than the defender, 
the offense should run that way if possible.

Stretch Plays  113
The three-by-one set in the spread offense is a good formation for 
getting numbers to the weak side to run the football. If the weak safety 
is playing games, the offense should go under center or to pistol forma-
tion and make the defense guess which way the play is going to be run. 
The play can always be checked. The 
offense can run the quarterback stretch 
back to the running back’s side of the 
formation.
All games to the 40 defense side 
are handled with the same three-man 
game calls. Again, the tackle and wide 
receiver can protect against the weak 
safety or weak corner fire from the 
boundary (figure 8.33). The offense 
can check to the speed option against 
this stunt, and the defense will have a 
problem.
A change-up used sometimes on the 
backside is to man the guard on a wide 
3-technique defender (figure 8.34). The 
backside tackle pulls and overtakes the 
path up to the linebacker. If the line-
backer runs hard, the linemen use the 
fast-flow technique to block him.
Summary
This chapter covered the blocking schemes of the stretch play to the 
tight-end side versus four different fronts. It also covered the one-back 
and two-back stretch plays to the split-end side with different blocking 
schemes on the perimeter.
In chapter 9, the blocking schemes of the inside zone will be discussed 
and explained. The inside zone is a very popular scheme used by many 
teams. I will share my philosophy related to the inside zone and discuss 
how to use it successfully.

Inside Zone
Most of the running game inside the tackle box is executed with the 
inside zone blocking scheme. When identifying the inside zone blocking 
schemes, terms such as power scoop and power slip are used on the backside 
of plays. Calls such as Jack Read, Jack Me, and Jack You are used on the 
front side of plays. (See chapter 7.)
My philosophy of the inside zone scheme is to first take care of the 
down lineman. He is the level-1 player. It is okay to not get off to the 
linebacker if both linemen need to stay on the down lineman. This is 
called securing level 1. Too many players worry about getting to the line-
backers. The end result is no one ends up blocking the level-1 defender.
The inside zone play can be run out of the I-formation in which the 
fullback goes to the backside of the play as a cutoff blocker. The inside 
zone play is also run with the fullback leading to the play side as an extra 
blocker. When this is done, we use motion to put a wide receiver or H 
back in position to be the cut blocker backside.
Out of the shotgun formation, we run a belly cutback dive play that 
uses the inside zone blocking scheme. This is a quarterback read play 
with an option back as well.
My philosophy is to stretch the defense and make them run from side-
line to sideline. Reverses, options, stretch plays, quick screens, and split 
screens can be run to achieve this movement of the defense. The offense 
can then come back hard inside with the inside zone running game. In 
this chapter, we look at blocking the inside zone versus four defensive 
fronts: odd, even, under front, and 4-3 stack.

116  Complete Offensive Line
Inside Zone Versus an Odd Defense
The tailback lines up 7 yards deep 
(figure 9.1). The fullback is used as a 
backside cut blocker off the backside 
edge. The backside tackle has to decide 
whether to use a 4 or 4I tackle alignment. 
In a 4 tackle alignment, the backside 
tackle aligns head up on the defensive 
tackle. In a 4I alignment, he aligns on 
the inside shade of the defensive tackle. 
These alignments require two different 
types of cutoff blocks.
The odd defensive front includes 
three down linemen and four lineback-
ers. The tailback uses open crossover steps to get square to the line of 
scrimmage. He should aim at the guard’s outside leg or the B gap. Versus 
an odd front, this play reads just like the stretch play. The tackle is the 
first read; the nose guard is the second read.
In a 3-4 front, defensive linemen often perform a lot of movement 
with slants and angles on the defensive front. The running back has to 
read the defensive tackle for his first read. If the first read goes outside, 
the ball should go into the B gap. If the defensive tackle pinches inside, 
the ball should go to the C gap. If the tackle slants outside and the nose 
guard slants hard to the play side, the tailback should be ready to cut 
the ball back behind the nose guard.
A mistake that running backs often make on this play is not pressing 
the line of scrimmage before they attempt to cut. If the running back cuts 
back too quickly, the offensive line, especially the backside guard and 
tackle, will not be in the right position.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: tight reach block
Tackle: tight reach block
Center: power scoop from play-side A gap to backside linebacker
Backside guard: power scoop from nose guard to backside line-
backer
Backside tackle: tight cutoff block or 18-inch cutoff block

Inside Zone  117
If there is movement to the inside of the 
play-side tackle, the guard should end up 
in a Queen read until he can work off to the 
play-side linebacker (figure 9.2). The center 
and backside guard power scoop the nose 
guard. The offense needs to handle level 1 
(all the down linemen) first before worry-
ing about getting to the linebackers.
Coaching Point
Offensive linemen should alert each other on the head-up technique. 
Knowing that there may be movement is advantageous. Linemen 
should handle the level-1 defenders first. They should not be in a 
hurry to get to level 2. If they aren’t careful, both linemen will be in 
a hurry to get to the linebacker.
When facing an odd front with the 
outside linebacker in a 6 or 7 technique 
on the tight end (figure 9.3), the offense 
can make a call for a three-man game just 
like the outside stretch play. This play is 
blocked like a stretch play. The football 
should bounce outside on the pinch of the 
linebacker.
The tight end and center should try to 
choke and squeeze the tackle and nose 
guard. The tackle and both guards should 
treat this as if it is the outside stretch play.

118  Complete Offensive Line
Inside Zone Versus an Under Front
Against the under front (figure 9.4), the 
offense must know what kind of nose guard 
they are up against. Is he quick? Can he run? 
Is he a big run stopper and gap player? Can 
the center handle him one on one or does he 
need help?
The offensive linemen execute their 
assignments:
Tight end: tight reach block
Tackle: tight reach block
Guard: stretch step, run track to linebacker
Center: reach nose guard or call for “pop” 
to get help from the play-side guard
Backside guard: power slip to linebacker
Backside tackle: power slip with guard
If the center calls for help from the play-
side guard (figure 9.5), the guard should use 
the drive block technique with his outside 
foot over and up. The inside foot and inside 
arm should come straight off, and he should 
make contact with the same foot and shoul-
der. The guard should stay on the double team as long as possible. The 
play-side linebacker will read isolation and step right up to the guard. 
When the linebacker gets even with the guard, the guard comes off and 
blocks him. If there is a 1-technique or gap player, the guard doubles 
him out to the linebacker.
Inside Zone Versus a 4-3 Defense
This should be an effective play because of all the bubbles in the 4-3 
defense. The backside 1-technique player must be controlled on this play. 
The center should make a presnap read on the depth and alignment of 
the middle linebacker. The center should not overzone the linebacker or 
let him fall back inside on the play.

Inside Zone  119
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: tight reach block
Tackle: stretch step, run track to linebacker
Guard: tight reach block
Center: stretch step, run track to Mike linebacker
Backside guard: cut off 1-technique player
Backside tackle: stretch step, run track to linebacker
The zone and stretch plays should look as similar as possible on the 
first stretch step. Helmet placement is very important, especially on inside 
zone plays. The goal is to get the defender running hard to the outside, 
if possible. If the defenders are big run stoppers, the linemen need to be 
ready to drop their hips and knock them off the ball. At the very least, 
they need to hold the line of scrimmage. Against any inside pinch moves, 
the uncovered lineman should be ready to double with the covered 
lineman (figure 9.6). The uncovered lineman 
should aim his second step to a point behind 
the defender’s inside foot. The uncovered line-
man needs to be able to stop all penetration 
and maintain the line of scrimmage. If two 
offensive linemen must be used on a pinch 
defender, then they let the linebacker go free.
Versus an under shift of the defensive front 
(figure 9.7), power combo blocks are a must. 
The covered offensive lineman must keep his 
play-side arm free and out of the block so he 
is able to come off if the linebacker attacks the 
line of scrimmage.
If the Sam linebacker walks up on the line 
of scrimmage, the tackle and tight end must 
make an out call.
If the nose guard is aligned in a shaded 
position on the center (figure 9.8), he needs 
to stretch step to the play-side A gap and 
work the same foot, same shoulder on the 
nose guard. He hangs for the backside guard 
as long as possible and then comes off on the 
Mike linebacker when the Mike linebacker 
commits to the line of scrimmage.

Another change-up that can be used is to 
fold the backside with the guard and center. 
The center works a back block to the V of the 
nose guard’s neck. The guard executes a drop 
step and pulls to the play-side A gap to block 
the Mike linebacker (figure 9.9).
Inside Zone Versus 
an Even Defense (40 Looks)
Many defenses try to disguise the 40 even front and the 4-3 defense with 
cheat alignments of the middle linebacker. If the Mike linebacker commits 
to the play-side A gap, the offense should treat it like a 4-3 defense and 
go with it (figure 9.10a). If the Mike linebacker gets to a point backside at 
which the center has to go backside to block him, then the offense should 
treat it like an even front (figure 9.10b).

Backside tackle: stretch step, run proper track to linebacker; if Mike 
declares, backside block man on man
The center must always be alert for the 
pinch. He always anticipates this and is ready 
to double to the play-side linebacker (figure 
9.11). The backside guard has to execute a cutoff 
block as the defensive lineman loops outside. 
The guard should squeeze off to the linebacker.

Inside Zone  121
The five offensive linemen zone step off the line of scrimmage and 
stay square to the line. By staying square, they will handle a lot of the 
movements that the defensive linemen are trying to execute. This is why 
it is so important for the center and guards to keep 18-inch splits and for 
the tackles to keep 2-foot splits.
When the defender is in a shaded alignment 
on the center, the offense should treat it like 
the 4-3 defense. The only difference is that the 
Mike linebacker is much more in the play-side 
A gap (figure 9.12). With this being the case, 
the center may have to tag the nose guard and 
abort a little quicker than he would against a 
true Mike linebacker in order to get his man.
The fold block versus the even front is no more than a linebacker trap. 
Calls have to be made on this scheme. The play-side guard has to know 
that the center is no longer working the play-side A gap and that the 
guard is man on man with the 3-technique defender.
This is a great scheme as long as the 
3-technique defender plays a 3 and does not 
pinch. Against an even front, the offense will 
usually get a lot of 3 techniques to 1 techniques 
and 1 techniques to 3 techniques. To counter this 
and take the pressure off the guard so he can 
come off the football, the guard’s assignment 
should be to do a tight reach (figure 9.13) and 
not worry about the pinch.
The guard must tight reach and rip off the outside shoulder of the 
3-technique defender. If the 3-technique player pinches to the inside, the 
guard doesn’t worry. Instead, he continues to the linebacker just like on a 
stretch or inside zone play. The pulling or folding guard folds and reads 
the inside half of the 3-technique player on his way to the linebacker. If the 
3-technique player widens, the guard goes up and blocks the linebacker. 
If the 3-technique player pinches, the guard trap blocks him inside out, 
and the tailback needs to hit it real tight.
If the backside tackle gets the fold call, he may have to take a stretch 
path to go get the backside linebacker deeper inside. This is especially 
true if the offense runs the inside dive from the shotgun.

Summary
This chapter covered the inside zone blocking scheme, including how to 
use it successfully against the four major defensive fronts. Power scoops 
and power slips are often used in this scheme, along with Jack and Queen 
combo blocks. The main point in this chapter is that the offense must 
take care of level 1 first.
The next chapter will cover the blocking schemes for the option play. 
When preparing for an upcoming game, one of the first questions the 
defense will ask is, “Do they run the option?” The option play can be 
difficult to defend if performed correctly. Let’s move on and learn to 
block for the option.
