# Drive Blocks

Drive Blocks
The drive block is the most basic and common run block used in 
football. It is the basis of the fundamentals for all run blocks. The drive 
block is a man-on-man, one-on-one block on the line of scrimmage, but 
it could also be used on a linebacker. The principles of a successful drive 
block can be incorporated into other blocks such as reach, cutoff, trap, 
and combo blocks.
The drive block requires a player to stay square to the line of scrim-
mage. The block involves three points of contact, including the helmet 
and both hands. For a successful block, the lineman must use leverage, 
keep a flat back, and use power-producing angles while maintaining 
a base. The four steps to the drive block are approach, contact, drive, 
and finish. This chapter covers the basic fundamentals and the various 
phases of the block.
Approach
The approach for the drive block begins with the perfect stance. Refer to 
chapter 2 for the fundamentals of the stance. The player should be perfectly 
balanced in a three-point stance with slightly more pressure on the hand 
so he can explode and come off the football. For a run block, he should 
have 60 percent of his weight on his down hand and 40 percent on his legs.
Next, the player applies mental weight to delegate which foot he will 
step with first. If stepping with the right foot first, he places his mental 
weight on his left foot and vice versa. The player must be ready for the 
first step and must execute the proper helmet placement. He wants to 
explode off his lead foot, stepping out and up with a 4- to 6-inch step.

The player comes off the lead foot. The lead step (figure 3.1a) should 
go out and up very slightly. This is similar to a short post step used on 
pass protection. When I say slightly, I mean very slightly. This helps 
keep the base wide on the first step. On drive blocks, the lead foot is 
often the inside foot. By using the inside foot, the lineman helps prevent 
the defender from crossing his face and getting the shortest route to the 
football. The size of this step varies depending on the size of the player. 
Taller, bigger players may take a 6- to 8-inch step. Smaller linemen may 
take a 4- to 6-inch step. No lineman should ever take a step so big that 
he gets off balance. The width on the first step shouldn’t be more than 
2 to 3 inches over and up.
The second step (figure 3.1b) needs to get down before contact. The 
style of defensive line play will affect the point of contact. When playing 
against a reading defender, the lineman may be able to get the second 
step down before contact. Against a penetrating defender, contact may 
be made on the second step. The coach should emphasize to players 
that they need to get the second step down as quickly as possible. The 
offensive lineman should explode off the line of scrimmage with power 
and torque.
 Regardless of how fast the players come off the line, it still may not 
be fast enough for them to make certain blocks. This is especially true 
in short-yardage situations. The lead step may differ according to the 
defender’s alignment over the offensive lineman and the direction of 
the play called.

The first step should incorporate all the characteristics of a good start 
(as covered in chapter 2): The lineman needs to come off the balls of the 
feet, keep the back flat, use leverage, stay low, and power off the back foot. 
The second step should be a power step. The lineman should step about 
6 to 8 inches, landing slightly ahead of or at least even with the lead step. 
He should work hard and concentrate on getting his second step down as 
quickly as possible. This keeps momentum going forward with power and 
strength. Note that the first two steps are short steps with power and torque.
The lineman’s base will automatically narrow on the second step no 
matter what he does physically. If his first step is inside with a narrow base, 
his second step will automatically be narrower, leaving him with no base 
at all. Therefore, the lineman must keep the base wide on the first step.
Many linemen have a tendency to cross over on the second step. When 
this happens, the body gets twisted, and the lineman has no chance to 
make the block. The biggest factor in creating this problem is a really big 
first step. This in turn may lead to a wide stride and then put the player 
off balance.
Tight elbows were de­
scribed in chapter 2. When 
a player uses tight elbows, 
he will have tight hands. 
The player should think 
of “firing his guns,” which 
refers to a gun fighter’s 
motion of drawing his 
weapons from his hol-
ster. After performing this 
motion, the player should 
then make a strong punch-
ing motion toward the 
target (figure 3.2). Tight 
Coaching Point
The feet on the human body naturally tend to stay close together. 
Offensive lineman is the only position in football that requires the 
player to maintain a base with his feet apart the entire play. The feet 
are always working to get back together. This is why the lineman 
must be disciplined in his steps and lower-body movements.

target.

elbows should be a carryover from drills done in the off-season and from 
constant coaching every day.
A player who consistently flares his arms out wide during blocks 
needs to do extra work after practice to cure this habit. For example, the 
player could punch a dummy 100 to 200 times with both hands. This 
should help the player develop the ability to keep tight elbows. If 200 
times doesn’t help, the player can try 500 times until he breaks the habit 
and forms a new one.
Key Points for the Approach to the Drive Block
1.	 Execute a perfect three-point stance.
2.	 Apply mental weight to the foot opposite of the one you will step 
with first.
3.	 Prepare to execute a good first step and proper helmet placement.
4.	 Place the second step down before contact.
5.	 Use tight elbows and tight hands.
Contact
Contact is the second phase of the drive block. For the contact phase, 
the first factor to consider is the aiming point. After all, the player can’t 
hit what he can’t see.
All players need to aim at a target during every block. The aiming point 
on the drive block is the defender’s chin (figure 3.3). If the lineman puts 
the crown of his helmet to the 
defender’s chin, the lineman 
should end up at the top of 
the defender’s numbers. The 
lineman should not overthink 
the aiming point; for example, 
he doesn’t need to have his 
right eye on the defender’s 
left number. He should just 
pick a point to focus on and 
then go get it.
The targets and the eyes 
may be the most important 
parts of the block. The line-
man must use his eyes to get

point for the drive block.

Drive Blocks  31
to the aiming point. For many players, their eyes are the least used parts 
of their body. A player wants big eyes on the target. When in the stance, 
he should look through his eyebrows to the aiming point. On each block, 
the lineman will use a different target on the defender. On the drive block 
versus a down defensive lineman, the offensive lineman looks through 
his eyebrows to the defender’s chin so the crown of the helmet is aimed 
through the target. Once the defender rises, the offensive lineman’s 
helmet is at the top of the defender’s numbers.
When the player gets to the fit of his block, he should make three-point 
contact (figure 3.4). On the drive block, the player needs to have three-
point contact with his helmet and both fists hitting the defender at the 
same time. The lineman’s hands should be in the defender’s armpits or 
tight on the breastplates 
of the defender’s pads. 
The lineman’s hips 
should be lower than his 
shoulders as he main-
tains a wide base. The 
toes should be slightly 
turned out on the drive. 
This will help produce 
power from the whole 
foot in the ground. The 
lineman’s hips, knees, 
and ankles produce 
the power that drives 
through the defender. 
This is where the Z cre-
ated by the knees and 
ankles (figure 3.5) helps 
produce power.
Once the lineman is 
in the fit of his block, the 
legs are very important. 
The lineman should 
push the defender as if 
he were a pickup that 
was out of gas. The 
lineman is behind the 
pickup, pushing on the 
rear bumper. He must 
keep pushing until he

ankles produces power to drive through the defender.
Figure 3.4  Three-point contact on the drive block.

gets gas. If the legs are the power, then the head, arms, and shoulders 
are the explosion.
The core of the body is vital in transferring power from the legs through 
the body and to the explosion. This power is transferred through the 
body’s core. Therefore, offensive linemen need to do abdominal work 
daily. Flat abdomens are a must.
The offensive lineman is like a bulldozer on tracks. Once the lineman 
is into the fit and has made contact, he needs to hit through the block, 
not to the block. The lineman should avoid rolling his hips because this 
pushes his head up and slows down the movement of the bulldozer on 
tracks. The lineman must be able to run through contact. The defender 
has only one chance to stop the delivery of the blow. The defender must 
strike a blow on the offensive lineman, then shed and remove the lineman 
to make a tackle. The offensive lineman who can withstand this initial 
attempt from the defender and continue to drive through contact with 
correct technique will win the block.
The bulldozer on tracks starts with the line of departure. From point 
A to point B, the lineman must come off the ball as fast as he can. This 
includes the angle of leverage from the takeoff point, which is the stance, 
until contact in the fit. The lineman should act as if a steel rod is running 
through his back, keeping the hips behind the shoulders. This allows the 
lineman to drive like a bulldozer on tracks!
Here are some things that can cause the blocker to lose power on 
contact:
• Bending at the waist to create a hump in the back
• Coming in too high and blocking with the chest, bosom to bosom
• Coming in with the head down and collapsing to the ground
• Not using the eyes on contact, resulting in being off center of, not 
square to, the block
To learn to see through contact, players can perform this drill: A coach 
or partner takes a hand shield, holds it sideways, and hits the player’s 
face mask to see if he blinks or flinches.
Here are some other major mistakes that offensive linemen make when 
getting to the fit of their block:
• Taking a first step that is too big, causing the second step to cross 
over
• Chopping their feet in the ground, which creates no movement or 
power steps
• Coming in too high and losing leverage by rolling the hips too fast

Key Points for the Contact During the Drive Block
1.	 Aim at the defender’s chin.
2.	 Use your eyes.
3.	 Make three-point contact with your helmet and both hands.
4.	 Be a bulldozer on tracks.
Drive
The drive (figure 3.6) is the 
most difficult part of the block 
for most linemen to execute 
effectively. To accomplish a 
good, hard drive, the lineman 
must use a complete combina-
tion of the power from the legs 
and the explosion from the 
upper body.
The first part of the drive is 
to sustain the block after get-
ting into the fit phase. Great 
acceleration from the feet is 
a must. The lineman’s legs 
should pound the ground. He 
must hit through the defender. The lineman needs to have a hard edge. 
He must be a jet coming off the football. He needs to stay fitted into the 
block. He has to want it. He has to want to whip this defender.
The biggest fault of many players is that they do not run with their feet 
or they extend their arms. They help the defender get separation. The 
lineman needs to stay as close as possible to the defender. A defensive 
lineman’s job is to explode off the line of scrimmage, deliver his blow, 
and stop the offensive lineman. In doing so, the defender wants to use his 
hands to get separation so he can run to the football. The offensive lineman 
does not need to help the defender get separation by pushing him away.
Key Points for the Drive During the Drive Block
1.	 Produce power from the legs.
2.	 Explode with the upper body.
3.	 Hit through the defender.
4.	 Stay close to the defender.

Finish
Finishing the block (figure 3.7) is 
a matter of personal pride. I want 
my players to be noticed for the 
way they play the game. I want 
others to recognize the style of 
play. The finish comes down to 
second and third effort. How 
many pancake blocks can the 
player get in a game?
To finish off the block, the 
player needs to
• play past the whistle,
• give a second effort on 
levels 2 and 3,
• use cut blocks at the end of the block, and
• take the block off the screen.
Finishing a block comes down to attitude, grit, and a desire to keep 
constant pressure on the defender. The lineman can keep constant pres-
sure on the defender by using short, powerful steps.
Key Points for Finishing the Drive Block
1.	 Make a second or third effort.
2.	 Keep pressure on the defender.
3.	 Take pride in how you finish the block.

Drills for the Drive Block
To improve their ability to perform the drive block, players should first 
work on stance and starts. I like to use drill lines whenever possible so 
players are conscious about their footwork. The proper techniques for 
the stance and start were covered in chapter 2.
Next, players should work on the approach and contact through the 
fit. They should then work on the drive and the finish. Players are in 
shorts for these drills, and they work against players who are holding 
hand shields that have armpits for hand placement.
Chutes should not be used for the first couple of days until the players 
learn this block. Players should use T-boards to get the feel of getting 
the second step down and the feel of having the board between their 
legs to maintain a proper base. (A T-board is a regular 12-inch board 
with a 6- to 8-inch board at the end to form a T.) The T-board helps the 
lineman take a short first step and quickly get the second step down. 
After successfully blocking live defenders on the T-boards, the team 
can progress to chutes.
After shoulder pads are introduced, players should work on block-
ing a live defender. The defender should believe it is his job to help the 
offensive man make the best block he can make.
The end of the progression is one-on-one blocks against the defensive 
line on boards. Place a board on the ground and then tape off a distance 
of 18 to 24 inches, depending on your team’s alignments. Players put 
their hands on or behind the line (figure 3.8) and come off the ball on 
the offensive lineman’s movement. A coach should control the drill with 
a whistle.
Figure 3.8  Two players on the boards.

36
Stance and Start
Players line up behind a white line and get into a great stance. Next, 
players come out of their stances using a drive block, stepping straight 
ahead. The coach should check to see if the players are overstriding on 
the first, second, and third steps. While teaching the drive block, the coach 
should use the reverse teaching progression.
Fit
The player is fitted into a handle shield using three points of contact with 
his head up in the middle of the pad. His hand should fit ear high on the 
shield. He uses tight elbows and a slight angle in his back. His feet should 
be slightly wider than his shoulders and should be turned out slightly to 
get the most power from the inside of the foot. On the coach’s command, 
the lineman drives the shield for 5 yards. The defender provides slight 
resistance so the lineman can perform the fit and drive portion of the 
block successfully. Repeat, adding more resistance each time until the 
block is done live on the boards.

37
Approach
The offensive lineman starts with a perfect stance and then jets off the ball 
with tight elbows and head up, making three-point contact. The first step 
(figure 3.9a) should be a short step, but the player should get the second 
step (figure 3.9b) down on the ground quickly to maintain a great base.
Figure 3.9  Approach: (a) first step; (b) second step.

a
After mastering the approach, the lineman can let Mother Nature take 
over as he maintains a good base while driving his feet with short, pow-
erful steps down the boards. The lineman hits through the block for three 
steps, then stops to see how he is fitting into the block. The offensive 
lineman must keep his head up, look through his eyebrows, and on the 
approach, make the three-point contact portion of the block. The line-
man needs to hit through the block, so he should form a habit of hitting 
through the contact part of the block. Many players will be either too high 
early in the approach or too low with the head down. These players must 
learn to come off with a flat back and get a feel for the perfect approach 
for them as an individual.
Next, the lineman comes off the ball with a right-foot drive, then a left-
foot drive, doing two left-foot drives for each right-foot drive.

38
Contact Through the Fit
The offensive lineman stands at the end of the board in a two-point 
stance. The lineman’s knee should be bent in a good football position; the 
shoulders are over the knees, the head is up, and the arms are bent with 
hands tightly closed by the hips. On the coach’s command, the lineman 
explodes out of the stance and uses three points of contact (the helmet 
and the hands) to hit the defender face up (figure 3.10). He drives his feet 
and moves the defender down the board. The lineman needs to make sure 
he stays as low as possible when coming out of the two-point stance. He 
needs to cock his arms back as if drawing his guns out of a holster and 
then deliver a powerful blow on 
contact. The player must bow 
his neck back and keep his 
head up on contact. The line-
man must have a good bend 
in the knees so that he can roll 
his hips after contact in order 
to execute the drive portion of 
the block. The lineman blocks 
the defender for about 5 yards 
down the board. Repeat the 
block with two left-foot drives 
and one right-foot drive.
Figure 3.10  Contact through the fit, left-foot 
drive.

39
Finishing the Block
The defender stands at the end of 
the board, and the offensive line-
man gets fitted into the block. On 
the coach’s command, the lineman 
drives the defender (figure 3.11a). 
The coach will give the defender a 
direction, and on the hand signal, 
the defender will break right or left 
(figure 3.11b). The offensive line-
man has to adjust his feet, turn his 
body, and move his feet to finish off 
the defender (figure 3.11c).
Figure 3.11  Finish: (a) Lineman drives; (b) defender breaks; (c) offensive lineman 
finishes the block.
One-Man Sled
Another way to learn the drive block, including the finish, is to use a one-
man sled that will recoil on contact. Place sandbags on the base of the 
sled so the offensive lineman really has to strain to get the sled moving. 
Once the sled is moving, the lineman must be sure to maintain a wide 
base while moving his feet so that he stays square on the sled. The sled 
will soon swing, so the lineman will need to move his feet to finish.

40
Execute the Drive Block
The lineman takes a perfect three-point stance at the end of the board. The 
defender needs to be about 3 feet off the lineman. On command, the lineman 
comes out of the stance, leading with the right foot. Keeping his back flat 
and his head up, the lineman aims his helmet at the defender’s chin (figure 
3.12). This should put his helmet at the top of the defender’s numbers when 
contact is made. The offensive lineman must remember to come off the foot-
ball with a flat back! He drives his feet into the ground. Once the defender is 
moving, the toe part of the offensive lineman’s foot should be turned slightly 
to the outside (nothing drastic, just a subtle turn). This will allow the lineman 
to get all of his foot in the ground to generate more power. While keeping 
pressure on the block, the lineman gets ready to use the second and third 
effort. When he feels that the defender is ready to separate and get off the 
block, the lineman uses the finish to end the block. If the defender goes to 
the right, the lineman uses left-hand pressure and then takes the defender 
in the direction he wants to go. Once on the approach, the lineman puts 
together all the phases of the block: contact, hit through the fit (with flat back, 
head up, and tight elbows), powerful steps, and leg drive.

Drive Blocks  41
Summary
The drive block is the mother of all blocks. It is the most basic and fun-
damental block in football. All forms of blocking originate with the drive 
block. All blocks have a stance, start, approach, contact, and finish. This 
will be evident as we move from the drive block to the reach block.
