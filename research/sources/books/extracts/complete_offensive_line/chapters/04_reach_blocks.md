# Reach Blocks

Reach Blocks
The reach block is the second block that offensive linemen should 
learn in the run game. The reach block is used on the front side of a run 
play. It is also used to gain outside position on a defender. Whether the 
team is using a man blocking scheme or a zone blocking scheme, an 
offensive lineman can use a reach block on the play side.
As a coach, I prefer to use zone blocking, so the reach block is a major 
part of the run game for my teams. With the reach block, the aiming 
point on the defender is the outside breast to armpit. The reach block is 
different from the drive block, but once the blocker gets on his approach 
path, the basics of the drive block are applied. The drive block is a basic 
block that involves pushing the defender straight back off the line of 
scrimmage. On the drive block, the offensive lineman covers the whole 
defender down the middle of the block. Basically, the reach block involves 
blocking the play-side half of the defender. The approach is on an angle 
to the outside half of the defender on the play side. The reach block is a 
very useful block for smaller, quicker linemen, such as many of the line-
men in high schools or small colleges.
Approach
The offensive lineman’s stance for the reach block is the same as the 
stance used for the drive, cutoff, and down blocks. Linemen can use a 
three-point or two-point stance when executing a reach block. Tackles 
have to use both. The lineman’s mental weight process is very important 
on the reach block because the goal is to gain outside position on the 
block. The first step of the reach block is a lateral step with the outside

foot. This step will usually cover 6 to 8 inches, but players should step 
whatever distance is necessary to avoid being off balance. This first step 
is referred to as the stretch step.
During the stretch step, the offensive lineman’s “guns” should be 
drawn to fire much like the position for the drive block. The lineman 
should focus on the target, which is the outside breast to armpit.
The offensive line should be aligned deep off the football. This allows 
the linemen to gain valuable angles on defenders (if the proper stretch 
step is taken). When taking the stretch step, the player’s head and shoul-
ders should work over the outside leg—that is, the leg that he stepped 
with (figure 4.1). Tight elbows are necessary to get the hands inside 
very quickly. The player should keep his shoulders parallel to the line 
of scrimmage as much as possible.
The second step may vary according to where the defender lines up. 
The aiming point is still the defender’s outside breast to armpit. For 
example, consider the reach block for an offensive guard or tackle facing 
a defender who is lined up in a 3 or 5 technique (figure 4.2). The lineman 
fits his block into the aiming point of the defender’s outside breast and 
armpit (figure 4.3).
Figure 4.1  During the stretch step, the head and shoulders work over the 
outside leg. The shoulders act as if they have a string attached to them: 
When the hip and leg stretch out to the right, the head and shoulders go 
with the leg on the same angle.

46  Complete Offensive Line
If the defender is in a 3, 5, or 9 technique, the offensive lineman’s 
stretch step should mirror the defender. The lineman’s toe should point 
downfield on the stretch step when he is blocking inside zone. The 
lineman’s stretch step should land even with the defender’s outside 
foot (figure 4.4a). The lineman’s second step should land even with the 
defender’s inside foot (figure 4.4b). The third step should be outside 
and upfield (figure 4.4c). The second and third steps have to be really, 
really quick. If you put it to music, it would be one–quick–two–three.

Reach Blocks  47
Contact and Fit
Just as in the drive block, three-point contact is needed for the reach 
block. The lineman’s helmet goes to the defender’s outside breast, and 
the lineman’s outside hand goes in the defender’s armpit (figure 4.5). 
The lineman’s inside hand should be on the defender’s inside number. 
The outside arm and leg must be strong on reach blocks—all pressure 
should be applied from the outside arm and leg. The inside hand is in 
push and control mode. On contact and fit, the lineman should try to 
stay as square to the line of scrimmage as possible.
Drive
Once in the fit of the block, the lineman should drive the defender on 
the angle. Linemen should not try to work for a quick hook on the line 
of scrimmage.
If the defender wants to run hard to the outside, the lineman should 
lock up and move his feet while maintaining outside pressure. If the 
defender runs hard to the outside after the lineman has started the drive 
on the defender—and the lineman believes that he is losing the block—the 
lineman should come hard with the inside hand and drive the defender 
to the outside (figure 4.6).
Coaching Point
On the angle refers to the lineman getting his hips in the direction of 
his aiming point. Basically, the lineman wants to execute a reach block 
in that direction. Once the blocker is into the fit of a reach block and 
has his hips on the right angle, he executes the basic fundamentals 
of a drive block with a great base and arm pressure. The offensive 
lineman blocks until the defender tells him where he wants to go. 
The lineman then adjusts his block accordingly.

Finish
In zone blocking, the finish on all blocks is very important. The reach 
block takes a lot of second and third efforts to make the play work. Once 
the defender is really hooked, the lineman should pin him hard and take 
him downfield. If the defender works hard outside, the lineman should 
use the reverse inside hand to take him where he wants to go. Because 
of the various directions that the defender may go, this block takes tre-
mendous effort from the offensive lineman.
Figure 4.5  During the reach block, the lineman’s helmet is at the defender’s outside 
breast, the lineman’s outside hand is in the defender’s armpit, and the lineman’s 
inside hand is on the defender’s inside number.

Reach Block Versus 3 and 5 Techniques
Performing the reach block on the 3 technique for the guard is the same 
as the tackle on the 5 technique. Both linemen need to focus on their 
aiming points—outside breast to armpit. They must take a great stretch 
step and explode into the block using all of the techniques previously 
mentioned. This includes keeping their elbows tight so they can punch 
while maintaining great balance. Once into the fit, the linemen must 
work the outside arm and leg strong—keeping a great base—to block 
the line of scrimmage. They should work the better player hard down 
the line of scrimmage and expand the defender. The phrase “knocking 
the defender off the line of scrimmage” is way overrated if the lineman 
can’t maintain the line of scrimmage while moving the defender laterally.
Using the Reach Block Against 3 and 5 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step is even with defender’s outside foot.
2.	 Second step is even with defender’s inside foot.
3.	 Third step gets on ground quickly; lineman runs on the angle.
4.	 Aiming point is outside breast to armpit.
5.	 Outside arm and leg are strong on contact and fit; lineman runs 
the hard angle.
Reach Block Versus 2 and 4 Techniques
In this situation, the defender is aligned much tighter on the blocker. 
A 2 or 4 technique means the defender is head up on the blocker. He is 
aligned shoe to shoe. When the offensive lineman is taking a stretch step, 
the outside foot should end up outside the defender’s foot. The primary 
aiming point is still the outside breast to armpit. Everything now becomes 
very tight. This is basically using a tight drive block with reach blocking 
techniques. In other words, the lineman takes one short stretch step and 
executes a drive block on the defender.

50  Complete Offensive Line
Using the Reach Block Against 2 and 4 Techniques
1.	 Defender is aligned tighter on offensive lineman.
2.	 Stretch step is outside defender’s outside foot. Stretch step doesn’t 
have to be as big as against other techniques.
3.	 Second step is to defender’s crotch.
4.	 Quick third step is out and upfield, with quick replace.
5.	 Aiming point is outside breast to armpit.
6.	 Contact fit and drive are the same as against the 3 and 5 techniques.
7.	 Lineman is squarer to the line of scrimmage.
Tackle’s Reach Block Versus 7-Technique or 3-Gap Player
The phrase “the wider the defender, the deeper the drop” will hold true 
when blocking a defender aligned in the 7 technique. This means the 
defender is wider; therefore, the offensive lineman needs to take a drop 
step with his outside foot deeper so that his hips are more opened on 
the angle of the defender. The lineman continues to use an aiming point 
of the outside breast to armpit. This block usually doesn’t end up with 
the blocker reaching the defender because of the angle. Once contact is 
made and the defender fights outside, the lineman should use the inside 
arm and press the defender to the outside.
Using the Reach Block Against 7-Technique or 3-Gap Player
1.	 Stretch foot opens toward outside foot of 7-technique or gap player. 
Foot points out at an angle; head and shoulders are on the same 
angle.
2.	 Second step is toward inside foot of 7-technique or gap player.
3.	 Third step comes hard; the lineman runs the angle. He still uses 
one–quick–two–three.
4.	 Helmet placement works defender’s middle to outside breast.
5.	 Lineman works outside arm and leg strong.

Reach Blocks  51
Block Versus Defender on Inside Shoulder
Defenders aligned in the 1 technique and the 4I technique are reach 
blocked by the center and guard. The center must be able to reach 1 
technique all day. This should be practiced year-round. Every time the 
shotgun is snapped, the center should work on reach blocking a man 
aligned in a 1 technique. The center has to take a deep drop and aim his 
helmet to the far shoulder of the 1-technique defender. The key for this 
block is to sprint and overplay the block. The lineman then makes contact 
with his helmet and uses his outside arm to gain control. Once contact 
is made, the lineman sprints with his hips headed to the sidelines until 
he gains control; at that point, the defender is hooked.
When the guard is reach blocking a 4I-technique player on the tackle, 
he will have help from the tackle 100 percent of the time. This will make 
his reach block not as drastic as the center’s block. The guard should 
deepen his first step on the stretch and aim for the outside breast to 
armpit, then help knock the tackle off the block. Once contact is made, the 
guard should work hard for position on the block and work the outside 
arm and leg strong.
Drilling the Reach Block
I picked up a great teaching fundamental from a high school coach who 
grew tired of telling his players to move up or move back while they 
were trying to drill. To cure this problem, the coach had the center align 
over the football; the coach then marked the spot in front of the football 
where the defensive lineman could place his hand as close to the ball 
as possible. Next, the coach marked the spot where the offensive line 
should align on the center. When I do this, I mark the spot so that the 
guard’s hand will align on the center’s shoelaces. I mark this spot where 
the guard’s hand is placed. This designates the offensive line–defensive 
line relationship for all drills worked on throughout the practice.
For most college players, the distance between these placements on 
the line of scrimmage and the blockers’ down hand is 28 to 32 inches. I 
would mark the spot at 30 inches. I now have lines painted on the football 
field that are 30 inches apart for our drills.

52  Complete Offensive Line
This is the best concept I have learned in coaching. All players can 
drill with the same relationship they will use in a game. Marking these 
spots also provides these benefits:
• The guards and tackles can drill without the center.
• Defensive players can line up where needed with their hands on 
the line. The coach doesn’t have to spend the whole day moving 
players up and back.
• All drills may be performed off these lines: all reach, cutoff, and 
down blocks; all zone and gap blocking schemes; and all pass blitz 
pickups.
Stretch Step
Players should learn the stretch step from behind a line. It can be a line on 
the football field or a line on the side of a basketball court. Players should 
place their toes behind the line but as close to the line as possible. All five 
of the offensive linemen are on the line. Each player does the following:
1.	 The player thinks about shifting his mental weight so that he can 
step.
2.	 The player executes one stretch step to the right and one to the left 
(figure 4.7). He takes one step only.

3.	 The player works on an inside zone step first.
4.	 The player executes the stretch step. He should never cross over 
his feet on inside zone.
5.	 The player works on firing his guns with tight elbows.
The players come off the ball and sprint 5 yards. They do this repeat-
edly until the coach believes they have mastered the technique. They 
then flip it over and come back with the opposite foot. I do first group, 
second group, then third group. I change the snap count with each group. 
A coach must work at this. The coach needs to be sharp and know what 
he is doing, giving each group a different count.
Stretch on Wide Zone
Next, players work on the stretch step on the outside stretch play. Each 
lineman should pretend that he has a wide player on his right shoulder 
going right.
1.	 The lineman executes a stretch step right. Emphasize putting the 
head and shoulders out over the lead step. This step needs to open 
wide, with toes pointed out toward the wide defender.
2.	 The lineman gets the second step down quickly.
3.	 The lineman maintains tight elbows. He should pump the elbows 
in a normal run motion.
4.	 The lineman runs the angle for 5 yards.
5.	 The lineman repeats the process of stretching right and then comes 
back with the left foot. Players should do this until the coach believes 
that they know what they are doing.

Learning Fit for the Reach Block
First, the lineman is fitted into the defender:
• Lineman’s helmet to the defender’s outside breast
• Lineman’s outside hand into the defender’s armpit
• Lineman’s inside hand on the defender’s inside number
• Lineman’s left foot at the defender’s crotch
• Lineman’s right foot outside the defender and slightly upfield
At the coach’s “go” command, the lineman makes the defender move 
to the outside and executes the best block possible. The lineman should 
work the outside arm and leg strong. The inside hand is used to guide 
with slight pressure. The lineman works to stay square to the line of scrim-
mage. He runs his angle of departure.
Step to Fit
The lineman goes back to the approach. He executes a stretch step right 
and gets his second and third steps down quickly. He practices contact 
and fit. The lineman makes three-point contact on the defender. He hits 
through the fit and stops.
Execute the Reach Block
For this drill, the linemen put all phases of the reach block together. 
They come out of their stance and block the defender using the correct 
techniques—approach, contact to fit, drive, and finish—for executing the 
reach block. The offensive linemen should do two or three of these every 
day in practice during individual period.
The right guard and right tackle go first. The center drills alone. Finally, 
the left guard and left tackle perform the drill. Linemen should practice 
the drive, reach, and cutoff blocks every day. For the first repetition of this 
drill, I have all of the linemen in a down stance. For the second repetition, 
the tackle is up in a two-point stance similar to when he is uncovered 
without a tight end.

Reach Blocks  55
The tackle uses the same techniques in a two-point stance as he does 
in a three-point stance. He should focus on staying down low, especially 
with the shoulders, when in a two-point stance. From the two-point stance, 
the tackle’s footwork is exactly the same as it is from a three-point stance.
In this drill, when the tackle is blocking out of the two-point stance, the 
defensive end should widen his alignment on the tackle. On the second 
repetition, I also have the 3-technique defender widen his alignment on 
the guard.
Summary
The reach block is a very important block in offensive line play and in 
any type of scheme, including zone blocking, man blocking, or sweep 
player on the wing. For the T blocking scheme, the reach block is a vital 
part of the team’s strategy.
There are no magic drills for teaching all these blocks. Remember, 
players should perform drive, reach, and cutoff blocks every day. When 
I think that players are not progressing at practice, or not executing well, 
I have the players do nothing but practice the drive, reach, and cutoff 
blocks for the entire individual period. This helps the players perfect the 
reach block as well as other blocks.
