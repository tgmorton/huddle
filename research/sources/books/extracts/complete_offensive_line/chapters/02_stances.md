# Stances

Stances
Offensive linemen are required to execute numerous blocking 
schemes in the run and passing games. They must be able to quick set 
on passes, zone step on runs, pull on boots or sweeps, and down block 
on gap plays. My one pet peeve as a line coach is when players use an 
incorrect stance. If a player does not have a good stance, everything 
else he learns will be useless, or he will not be able to obtain the desired 
degree of perfection.
The center uses a two-point stance with his hand on the football. 
Guards use the three-point stance most of the time. In goal-line situations, 
guards use the four-point stance. During a 2-minute drill at the end of the 
game, guards get into a two-point stance. The tackle is in a three-point 
stance as long as he is covered on the line of scrimmage by a tight end. 
If there is no tight end, the offensive tackle is in a two-point stance. The 
only time this changes is when the offense is backed up on the goal line 
or is inside the 4-yard line and attempting to score. In those situations, 
the tackles should be in a three-point stance.
A four-point stance is not used as much in football today as in the 
past. However, on short-yardage plays, such as a quarterback sneak, the 
offensive linemen will often get into a four-point stance. This stance keeps 
the players’ shoulders square and low to help make the play successful.

Down Stance
The first thing players must learn is that they need to show the same 
stance on every play. The defense should not be able to read run or pass. 
If one look is given, it should be a run stance.
To assume the proper stance, a lineman should stand and position his 
feet slightly wider than his shoulders (figure 2.1). He must make sure he 
doesn’t get his feet too wide. The toes need to be slightly turned in (figure 
2.2) so the big toe can be used to push off and provide the best start. Think 
of a sprinter getting into the starting blocks. The sprinter’s feet are set 
to come off the big toe. There are no duck stances in the starting blocks.
Figure 2.1  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulders.
Figure 2.2  Turn toes in slightly.

To show the players what works, I sometimes have the biggest lineman 
on the team help me perform a demonstration. I turn the lineman’s feet 
out really wide, put my hands on his chest, and tell him to lean against 
me and drive block me. The lineman, even at 300 pounds or more, will 
not be able to move me (at 160 pounds) with his feet in this position. 
Once I let him turn his toes in, I can’t come close to stopping his block. 
A live visual demonstration like this brings home the point to players.
After positioning the feet, the lineman should then move into the squat 
position (figure 2.3). The lineman’s hands should be cupped, and his 
forearms should be on his thighs. His back is completely flat.

The lineman’s knees should be under his breast. He can pretend that he 
has magnets on the inside of each knee and that they are pushing against 
each other. The ankle, knee, and thigh should make a Z shape, creating a 
power angle. A lineman must use power angles in making blocks.
The lineman should now relax and get out of the stance. Players can 
use the following exercise to work on correct hand placement: The player 
bends over to the ground and picks up an imaginary basketball. He palms 
the ball with the hand that he uses as his down hand in the stance. A 
right-handed player who has used a right-handed stance since he started 
playing football should use a right-handed stance. The same applies for 
the left-handed player. Left tackles will often use a right-handed stance. 
It is surprising how weak some players’ hands and fingers are when 
starting this drill. The player should stand as if he is palming a basketball 
to get the feel of how the hand should be positioned when it is placed 
on the ground. When palming a basketball, the player’s fingers have to 
get as far apart from each other as possible while the palm maintains a 
shape that fits the roundness of the ball.
Develop Strong Hands
Lack of strength in the hands is a big problem for many football players. 
The goal is to have pure strength with the ability to grip like a vice. This 
can be developed through the use of sand. Fill two garbage cans with 
sand. Using both hands at the same time, the player squeezes the sand 
for 100 repetitions. He should use a deliberate grip and fast repetitions. 
Rice is a good alternative to sand. Place some rocks or a box at the 
bottom of the can to help stabilize the can and to use up some of the 
volume so you don’t have to use as much rice. Players should do two 
sets on three days a week.
The lineman should repeat the process of getting into the stance: He 
stands with the feet slightly wider than the shoulders, turns the toes 
in, and squats with cupped hands and with the forearms on the thighs, 
keeping a flat back. Now he places the down hand slightly inside the foot 
to the hand’s side—right hand by right foot or left hand by left foot. The 
coach should check to see if air is under the hand and fingertips. Placing 
the hand wider allows a lineman to have square shoulders in relation 
to the line of scrimmage. This goes back to being perfectly balanced in 
the stance. I’m not a proponent of using a left-handed stance on the left 
side of the line of scrimmage unless the player is left-handed. By using 
a parallel, balanced stance, a right-handed player on the left side of the 
line should have no problem.

Stances  15
An offensive lineman should strive to have a totally balanced stance 
with 33 percent of his weight on each leg and 33 percent on the down 
hand. This totals 99 percent, leaving 1 percent in the player’s plum bob 
(you figure it out). A player should watch himself when getting into his 
stance. Players often have a tendency to roll into the stance. This will place 
too much weight on the down hand, resulting in an imbalanced stance. 
The player can correct this problem by getting in the squat position first. 
Once in this position, he works his butt from side to side while placing 
his hand out in front on the ground. The habit of rolling forward into the 
stance is a habit that a lineman must break early. The head should be up, 
with eyes toward the eyebrows looking at the defender (figure 2.4). The 
off arm should rest on the thigh with the hand inside the framework of the 
body. This will allow quick use of the hands and will keep them inside.

The lineman should set in the stance and get a feel for shifting his 
weight. He should practice by picking up the right foot then the left foot 
or picking up the down hand while maintaining his balance.
A player who cannot physically get into the desired stance can simply 
make small adjustments that will allow him to be successful. An extremely 
tall player should spread his feet out wider. A player with extremely stiff 
ankles and hips can use a small stagger in his stance. First, the player 
should attempt a toe-to-instep stagger. He may have to slightly widen 
the base. An extremely tall player who has a narrow body type may need 
to use a stagger that moves his foot back to the heel. However, players 
should use the toe-to-heel stance as a last resort because it puts the player 
at a major disadvantage when using a stretch step to the inside. A player 
who uses the toe-to-heel stagger may have to use more of a drop step 
to gain position when making blocks to his inside. The term drop step 
is used very loosely. When trying to cut off or reach a defender who is 
lined up wide on the offensive lineman, the offensive lineman must give 
ground with his play-side foot and leg to gain the angle needed to block 
the defender. The player must give some ground to gain some ground. 
This step is still more of a stretch step to the outside than an actual drop 
of the foot straight back. The lineman is basically opening his hips on 
the proper angle to the defender.
Up Stance
The up stance, or two-point stance, is used by an offensive tackle who 
is not covered by a tight end. For an offensive tackle, being in an up 
stance is beneficial when he has to block a speed rusher off the edge. As 
in the down stance, the feet should be slightly more than shoulder-width 
apart. The outside leg is slightly outside the framework of the body, but 
not extremely. In the two-point stance, the lineman drops the outside 
foot back. He starts out toe to instep and no farther than toe to heel. A 
big stagger creates problems with cutoff blocks or zone blocks in the 
scheme. Once the feet are aligned properly, the lineman goes to squat 
position. The drop foot should be in the ground if possible, but many 
players have physical restrictions that make this challenging. A player 
may need to slightly widen his stance or slightly twist his foot to help 
the foot lie closer to the ground.

Stances  17
In the up stance, the upper body is loose and relaxed, and the forearms 
are relaxed on the thighs (figure 2.5). The shoulders should be over the 
knees. In all stances, linemen must understand that a relaxed muscle is a 
faster muscle. The linemen should be loose in their stance and in a relaxed 
state of play so they can perform to the best of their ability.

First Step and Helmet Placement
The first step and helmet placement are key. Most coaches emphasize 
getting the second step down on the ground. I also coach players to get 
their second step down as fast as possible, but I stress that if they don’t 
get their first step right, the second step makes no difference.

18  Complete Offensive Line
The lineman should now try going to a zone scheme and repeating 
the process with a stretch step right (figure 2.7a) and a stretch step left 
(figure 2.7b) to get a better feel for using the mental weight process. (The 
stretch step will be covered in more detail in chapter 4 in the discussion 
of the reach block.)
Gaining the proper helmet placement is a habit that must be formed 
through practice. An important coaching tip when linemen are learning 
helmet placement is that they should always keep their eyes on the target 
or aiming point. Whether aiming for the chin on a drive block or the V 
of the neck on a down block, linemen should always drive through the 
defender with their eyes focused on their target. Many football players 
Another term used to describe the first step and helmet placement is 
mental weight. If stepping with the right foot, the lineman needs to shift 
his mental weight to the left leg. This is not a full-body lean, just a short 
weight shift to the opposite leg. A lineman’s success is a product of his 
first step. To better understand mental weight, players can imagine that 
the right foot has all of the body weight on it; then they should try to 
pick up the right foot and move it. This cannot be done. The same is true 
when lining up on the offensive line. Proper mental weight allows the 
lineman to take proper steps. This is key when playing on the offensive 
line. Once a lineman gets a feel for body balance and mental weight shifts, 
he should begin to work on starts. He should come off the ball with the 
right-foot step on a drive block (figure 2.6a). He then repeats with a left-
foot step on a drive block (figure 2.6b).

have bad eye habits and do not use their eyes effectively on the field. 
Football players need to take advantage of this resource and use it to their 
favor. It is difficult to hit something if you are not looking at it. A player’s 
eyes will never let him down. I stress big eyes every day in practice. The 
example I like to use is Mike Singletary of the Chicago Bears. He played 
with his eyes wide open. Using the eyes makes a player much more 
aware of what is happening in his area of the field.
If an offensive lineman gains position on the block, this can make the 
difference between a long run and a very short one. A solid first step is 
the best way to gain this position. For the blocking that I teach in the 
zone blocking scheme, the first step and helmet placement are the core 
fundamentals that players must master in order to become successful.
Square Shoulders
Another valuable coaching tip in the run and pass game is that linemen 
should keep their shoulders square to the line of scrimmage. This means 
that the shoulders should run parallel to the yard lines on the football 
field. Square shoulders allow offensive linemen to stay in position for 
blocks and to pass defenders off to each other in the run and pass game. 
Square shoulders are included in run fundamentals because of their 
value in zone blocking schemes. I often tell my players that if we run 
north and south coming off the ball, and the defense goes east and west, 
we will win the game. This theory holds true with an experienced and 
disciplined offensive line.

Tight Elbows
No one wants to coach 747s with a wide wingspan. Therefore, a popular 
coaching term is tight elbows. This is a wrestling term. Tight elbows mean 
tight hands. Inside hands kick butt. Many drills can be used to develop 
tight hands. For example, in our mat program, we use small 12-inch 
hand pads that players punch as part of the warm-up (figure 2.8). I like 
these pads because they can be moved around easily. This makes for a 
drill that requires players to move very quickly and helps them develop 
quick, tight hands.
Offensive linemen must learn to use tight elbows when coming out 
of their stance for starts on any type of blocking scheme—whether it’s a 
zone, stretch, pull, or pass set.
Boxing during the summer and hitting the speed bag are also great 
drills for developing tight, quick hands. The best pads to use are hand 
shields that have the armpit for hand placement. The pads on our sled 
are from World Sporting Goods in Mobile, Alabama. These pads have 
the armpits built into the pad for hand placement purposes.

Sumo Drill
This sumo drill can be used in the off-season. Take a round hoop and 
lay it on the ground with a yard line going through the middle. Two play-
ers take their places inside the hoop with one hand on the other’s chest 
and one hand off (figure 2.9a). Both players are in a two-point stance. 
The players should keep their head out of the drill in order to avoid head 
butts. On the coach’s command of “go,” the players see who can throw 
the other out of the circle (figure 2.9b). After getting a feel for the drill, 
players take their hands off each other and go like two wrestlers, free to 
shoot their hands. This shows which player gets his hands inside first, 
while still trying to throw the other out of the hoop. Create a round-robin 
tournament and see who ends up King of the Hoops.

chest and one hand off; (b) each player tries to throw the other player

Hands and Leverage
Playing in the trenches of football is a game of hands and leverage. The 
low man who has inside hands will win a great percentage of the time. 
Players with great steps and helmet placement but poor hand technique 
will lose blocks and draw holding penalties. Players with great hands 
and low pad level give themselves opportunities to defeat defenders 
who may be more talented.
Leverage is a facet of the game that levels the playing field. A smaller 
player can make himself physically dominant over a larger player by 
coming off the ball with low pads and getting under the defender. Inside 
hands help him push and control the block. A player who can run with 
bent ankles, knees, and hips can play football with leverage. To measure 
a player’s natural ability to play with leverage, the coach should watch 
the player bend on lifts in the weight room, including positions during 
the squat, power clean, hang clean, and deadlift. Also, to check for ankle 
stiffness, the coach can have the player stand with his feet wide and toes 
turned out; the player then squats like a baseball catcher, and the coach 
checks to see if the player’s heels come off the ground.
Some players naturally have more leverage than others, but leverage 
can also be developed. Players can develop leverage and explosion in 
the weight room by performing Olympic lifts that focus on the lower 
body. They can also improve their leverage by using bands and exercise 
balls to perform various stretches and exercises that encourage static 
flexibility in the lower body. Every inch of leverage is worth 10 pounds.

Six-Point Explosion Drill
The six-point explosion drill can be per-
formed on the pad of a sled or with a person 
holding a hand shield. The player gets on 
his hands and knees on the ground and 
curls his toes under his feet (figure 2.10a). 
He shifts his weight back on his toes. He 
then explodes forward with his hips, keep-
ing his head up and exploding his hands 
through the pad (figure 2.10b). This is a 
full-extension movement that will leave the 
player in a fully extended position.

toes curled under the feet; (b) exploding forward with hands going through the pad.

Chest Pass Drill
During the off-season, players should perform explosion drills to help 
develop hip explosion. Here is one effective drill that can be used: The 
player places a medicine ball on the ground with both hands on the side 
of the ball as he stands over it. He passes the ball from the ground as 
if throwing a chest pass in basketball while stepping with the right foot 
(figure 2.11a). The player then repeats the process with a throw from the 
ground while stepping with the left foot (figure 2.11b).

The player can also do this drill from the knees. He throws the ball while 
lunging the hips forward, then falls forward to the ground (figure 2.12).

Summary
A proper stance, good hand position, and leverage are key for all blockers 
along the offensive line. Hands inside the framework of the body come 
from having tight elbows. Tight hands in the armpits of the defender’s 
breastplate allow the offensive lineman to control the defender in the 
run game. This hand position also leads to success for the center and 
guards much of the time in pass protection. A lineman achieves this 
hand position by keeping his eyes focused on the target and punching 
aggressively to the target.
In the next chapter, we’ll discuss the drive block, including the stance, 
approach, steps, and contact for this fundamental block. Drills for per-
fecting this block will also be presented.
