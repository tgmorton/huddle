# Pass Protection

---

Pass Protection
My philosophy of pass protection is to be very aggressive and 
solid at the guard and center positions. The tackles must keep the outside 
edges strong. I have a saying about how fast the linemen need to get set 
on pass protection: “They can’t get set fast enough.” However fast they 
can get set, it is not fast enough.
My offensive linemen use three types of pass sets: the post, kick slide, 
and vertical. The linemen must master all three, so we work on sets 
every day before practice and sometimes after practice. The technique 
of pass protection is a phase of football that can be worked on every day 
year-round because players don’t need to have pads on to work on their 
technique.

75 Percent–25 Percent Advantage
Regarding percentages of position that an offensive lineman wants on 
the defender, a 75 percent to 25 percent advantage is the ideal position. 
We call this alignment the 75 percent–25 percent offensive advantage 
(figure 11.1).
Figure 11.1  75 percent–25 percent offensive advantage.
Some coaches want the offensive lineman’s outside leg in the defend-
er’s crotch. This is the same thing I coach, but I stress that the offensive 
lineman must look at his aiming point. If the offensive lineman is told 
“foot to crotch,” he is not expected to look at the defender’s crotch. The 
aiming point is the defender’s inside breast. The offensive lineman needs 
big eyes on the defender’s inside breast. The offensive lineman must 
never look at the rusher’s head.
On the 75 percent–25 percent advantage, linemen should use a kick slide 
set or vertical set. The offensive guards and center will short set this align-
ment. A short pass set means the lineman gives no ground and gets hands 
on the pass rusher as quickly as possible. For the 75 percent–25 percent 
advantage, the lineman’s footwork should involve picking up and replacing 
with the outside foot first, the inside foot second. The defender is already 
aligned where the lineman wants him; this is perfect position. There is no 
reason to set inside or outside, so the lineman should just step and replace.
A common error made by offensive linemen is to set out and get shoe 
to shoe or head up (figure 11.2), opening up the inside rushing lane. The 
lineman must maintain his 75 percent–25 percent relationship to keep 
the rusher outside. Against a real tight 3- or 5-technique defender, the 
lineman can use what is known as a short post to cover the slant. This is 
described in the upcoming section on the post set.

or shoe-to-shoe alignment.
Post Set
The post set will push the offensive blocker back into a 75 percent–25 
percent advantage position. A 50 percent–50 percent advantage even is a 
head-up shoe-to-shoe alignment. To get back to 75-25, the lineman takes 
an inside-foot post set to gain this relationship (figure 11.3).

shade alignment on the offensive blocker.

The footwork is very important in gaining position, but the lineman 
must also remember to get his hands on the defender as quickly as pos-
sible. When working the hands, the lineman should try to imagine the 
inside hand becoming as strong as possible. He should place it inside the 
defender’s breastplate as quickly as possible; the outside hand should be 
inside the framework as well. The feet and hands have to work together as 
one movement. The only way to have tight hands is to have tight elbows. 
Coaches should constantly relay this point to players while working on 
pass protection.
The inside shade gives the defender 
a 75 percent–25 percent advantage. 
The offensive blocker must work back 
to get head up and get at least back 
to 50 percent–50 percent even (figure 
11.4a).
A two-step post set (figure 11.4b) will get the offensive lineman back to 75 
percent–25 percent. Against the inside shade, the lineman should make sure 
he at least gets back to head up and should fight to stay at least 50 percent–50 
percent. The post sets are still easier to do than setting a 3 or 5 technique.
Tackle Play
If the tackle is touching the defender, he uses a one-step kick and then 
quick sets the rusher. At the tackle position, the offensive lineman must 
be ready to cut angles and must be able to read the proper angle to take so 
he can block the pass rusher with a one-step, two-step, 
or three-step kick slide. If he can’t use one of these, the 
tackle must use a vertical pass set. The one-step kick is 
similar to the guard setting a 3 technique. The tackle 
wants to get his hands on the defender as quickly as 
possible while making sure he doesn’t overset him 
and get heads up (figure 11.5). If the rusher is hardly 
touching the tackle, the tackle can set out and get to 
a foot-to-crotch 75 percent–25 percent relationship 
because the defender is one man removed. This is 
done by using a two-step kick set (figure 11.6).
When the defender widens to a point where he is a couple yards away 
from the blocker, the blocker can use another technique called half the 
distance. This is used more often by the tackles than the guards or center.

Pass Protection  135
A defensive end will often align outside wide and tilt to the inside. 
This alignment makes the tackles feel very uneasy, and they tend to jump 
outside and then get beat inside.
Tackles judge half the distance between the rusher and the tackle. The 
tackle must judge this spot on the line of scrimmage and must also judge 
the depth of the pass set. This is because the junction point is not on the 
line of scrimmage but at an angle deep in the backfield. Understanding 
how to judge these angles is very important for the tackles.
I have never had a tackle get beat when he got a three-step pass set and 
was square to the line of scrimmage. This is usually a two-step kick set 
and should never be over a three-step kick. The imaginary spot halfway 
between is the key to the technique. Staying as square as possible to the 
line of scrimmage while getting depth is also a big key to success.
Vertical Set
The vertical pass set will allow the blocker to get more depth quicker, 
but the width of the pocket will be smaller. When going against a pure 
speed rusher who is an upfield speed guy, the offensive lineman should 
use the vertical pass set. On the vertical pass set, the lineman keeps the 
shoulders square to the line of scrimmage and reads the inside number 
of the pass rusher.
Learning the Post Pass Set
As stated earlier, a lineman should use the post pass 
set on a head-up to inside pass rush defender. The 
term short post is used when the lineman is facing 
a defender in a tight outside shade who may rush 
inside (figure 11.7). It is also used when the lineman 
is facing a defender in a head-up even alignment or an inside-shade 
alignment. The post set for the tackles is taught in the same way as the 
post is taught for the guards.
When learning the post, linemen should start with the same balanced 
stance used for the running game. The blocker reads the defender’s feet 
to read the alignment. If a defender is head up or inside, the blocker 
steps with the inside foot first. He steps inside and slightly gains ground 
until he is strong with the inside leg. Then he puts the inside foot into 
the ground and holds (sticks it). When taking the step inside, many

blockers make the following mistake: When the foot hits the ground, it 
flies back behind the blocker so that the inside foot is now back and the 
outside foot is up. When the inside foot moves, the outside foot should 
simultaneously come with it so the blocker can maintain balance. A lack 
of balance and poor positioning are the main reasons a blocker gets beat.
When the blocker takes his inside post step, his inside hand comes 
hard to the rusher’s inside breast. Tight elbows make for tight hands. 
The blocker should get his hands on the defender as quickly as possible. 
If the defender is lined up with an inside shade, the blocker should post 
the rusher on a two-step post and try to get back the 75 percent–25 per-
cent position. The blocker must get to at least 50 percent–50 percent. He 
should carry his body weight on the inside half of his body. This goes 
back to mental weight and knowing how to adjust his body while not 
worrying about the defender. The blocker should read the defender’s 
inside number. He should never look at the defender’s head. He needs 
to focus on the inside breast.
Kick Slide Technique on Outside Shade
The first thing to remember on the kick slide pass set is to not overset. The 
blocker should not set out; he should get back to 50 percent–50 percent on 
the rusher. Defensive linemen are taught to read the blocker’s shoulders. 
They read how fast the blocker jumps out, rises up, or turns to the side-
lines. This tells them what moves they need to make. If the blocker jumps 
outside fast, the defender is going to go inside. If the blocker rises up, he 
will get bull rushed. If the blocker turns and drops his second step in the 
bucket, the defender will use an underarm rip or pull and swim inside.
Coaching Point
Pass blockers need to stay aggressive up and down the line of 
scrimmage, not into the line of scrimmage. Too often players take 
a good set and then lunge into the line of scrimmage. A great pass 
blocking guard or center learns to slide firmly up and down the line 
of scrimmage. A tackle should be at more of an angle off the line of 
scrimmage. The blocker must be aggressive on these angles. Over-
extending and lunging forward may result in becoming top heavy. 
This is the biggest mistake made in pass protection.

Pass Protection  137
Every time a blocker sets an outside technique, he should set it and 
be ready for the inside move. The best tactic versus the inside slant is 
to punch the rusher as quickly as possible and try to shock him or get 
him off balance. The blocker’s inside hand should be dominant if pos-
sible. But if the blocker can shock the defender with both hands, that’s 
great. When working the pass set drills, linemen should always set three 
one-step kick sets. After setting the kick sets, they should set three more 
kick sets, but this time, as soon as the outside foot hits the ground, the 
linemen should come back inside on a two-step post. This simulates a 
3-technique defender using an inside rush on the lineman as he sets out 
to block the 3-technique defender.
Figure 11.8  Tackle using a one-step kick set versus an outside-shade defender.
If the blocker sets and stays square to the line of scrimmage as much 
as he can, this forces the rusher to think, and the blocker has gained an 
advantage. The defender is waiting for the offensive lineman to tell him 
what move to use. If the defender has to stop and think because the line-
man is square to the line of scrimmage, the lineman has the advantage—at 
this point, he wins.
Versus the Outside-Shade Technique
By using a one-step kick set, the blocker can get the position he needs to 
defeat a defender in an outside-shade technique (figure 11.8). The blocker 
takes the first step with his outside foot back about 6 inches and resets 
his inside foot. He must use quick hands. He reads the rusher’s inside 
breast and gets his hands inside. The blocker should never look at the 
pass rusher’s hand.

138  Complete Offensive Line
Vertical Pass Set
The vertical set is used when the tackle and guards 
are responsible for blocking three or four defenders 
without any help (figure 11.9). It is also used when 
the tackle is facing a fast inside rusher and wants to 
avoid oversetting him; in this case, the tackle will use 
a vertical set to cut the angle.
For the vertical set, the blocker takes a 45-degree 
kick slide step with the outside foot. Once he performs 
the kick slide, he drags the inside foot straight back. Then he sets one, 
two, three steps straight back with the outside foot moving vertically 
back from the line of scrimmage.
Vertical Set Against a Wall
Offensive linemen can learn the vertical set by working against a wall. 
The lineman sets up about 2 feet away from the wall, facing the wall. He 
takes a 45-degree kick slide step toward the wall and drags the inside 
foot straight back. He then moves vertically down the wall with a one-step 
kick. When he is comfortable with that, he performs a vertical two-step 
kick backward down the wall. He finishes with a 45-degree kick step and 
drag one, two, three. The lineman stays square to the wall, performing the 
vertical pass sets. The wall keeps him going backward and prevents him 
from getting width. This teaches the lineman to get depth on his pass set.
Pass Protection Drills
Players can work on pass protection drills during the off-season and the 
summer. Successful pass protection is a combination of balance and body 
control. Pass protection drills help each player gain control of his body 
and learn proper technique. All linemen should be able to work from a 
three-point or two-point stance on all pass protection drills.

Kick Sets and Vertical Sets
To begin, the linemen on the left side of the line execute three one-step 
kick sets on the command “set hut,” “set hut,” “set hut.” The linemen on 
the right side of the line then execute three one-step kick sets. Next, the 
linemen on the left side execute three one-step kick sets and then drive 
back inside on a two-step post to simulate blocking a pinching defender. 
The linemen on the right side then repeat the same pattern.
Next, the linemen on the left side execute two-step kick sets. The line-
men on the right side then repeat the pattern. Guards do the same sets 
because the technique used is the same as fan protection versus the 50 
defense. The guard has to take a two-step kick to block the 5-technique 
defensive tackle.
The tackles then work on the three-step kick slide. During this time, the 
guards work on performing the one-step kick and coming back inside on 
the two-step post to simulate blocking a pinching defender to the inside.
Finally, the linemen work on the vertical set. This includes the tackles 
and guards. On the vertical set, the tackle sets back three steps, and the 
guard sets back two steps. Then the linemen work on the sort technique 
and gap techniques. For the sort technique, there are three defenders 
and only two blockers.
All of this is done with nothing but sandbags. Use sandbags on the first 
and second sets of each drill. The third set is done on air; the lineman 
simply takes the set as if in a game. This allows the linemen to move 
with quickness after using the 20-pound sandbag on the first two sets.
When the guards and tackles perform these sets from the down stance, 
they hold the sandbags on the ground with both hands. When they take 
the post and kick sets, they need to bring the sandbag up and punch on 
the first step of the post or the first step on the kick set.

140
Kick Sets and Vertical Sets With Chest Pass
The second drill is similar to the first except it includes a chest pass at 
the end of the drill. In part 2 of the drill, the linemen post set out of the 
two-point stance holding the sandbags in both hands. After executing 
the post from the down stance, the linemen continue to post and punch 
four more times down the line. When the linemen hit the fifth step, they 
execute a punch and throw the sandbag like a chest pass in basketball. 
They then repeat this drill from the two-point stance. After the post set, 
they throw the sandbag on the fifth step.
Double-Punch Drill
In the double-punch drill, the blocker hits one defender and then quickly 
comes off to a second defender. This drill requires three players in each 
group. While one group is working, the next group should be ready to go 
as soon as the first group finishes. After the first group finishes and starts 
to rotate players, the coach begins coaching the next group on the drill. 
The coach continues coaching while each group rotates.
The group of three should include two bag holders and one offensive 
pass blocker. The first bag holder is set out on a loose outside shoulder 
technique so the offensive blocker has to take a one-step kick set and 
punch the bag holder. As soon as he punches the first bag holder, the 
blocker must come back inside and punch the second bag holder, who 
was off the ball and comes late.
Twist Drill
My offensive linemen do the twist drill on Wednesdays and sometimes 
Thursdays during the season. Start with the left guard and left tackle. 
Two defenders execute a tackle-end twist or an end-tackle twist. The 
offensive tackle and the guard work against both of these games. Only 
work two at a time.
The left guard and center are now in focus. The two defenders work 
a tackle-nose twist or a nose-tackle twist on the center and guard. A 
defensive end can be substituted if the coach wants the offensive tackle 
to work on reacting against a player with more speed.

141
The center and right guard now work the same two twists—the tackle-
nose and nose-tackle twist. Lastly, the drill moves to the right guard and 
right tackle; these two players work against the tackle-end twist and the 
end-tackle twist.
When the first-team players have each completed their two pickups, 
the second-team offensive linemen should rotate into the drill. Repeat the 
drill with the second-team players, starting on the left side.
Coaching Points
The guards’ alignments are far off the football. The center must learn to 
snap the football and get back even or deeper on the line of scrimmage 
while the guards pick up the twist games.
One-on-One Pass Rush Versus Defensive Line
We do this drill for at least 9 minutes a day on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, 
and Thursdays during the season. Start by lining up the five offensive 
linemen on the line of scrimmage. To begin the drill, the left tackle blocks 
the defensive end on two pass rushes. Next, the left guard blocks for two 
pass rushes versus the defensive tackle, followed by the center for two 
on a defensive tackle, the right guard for two on a defensive tackle, and 
then the right tackle for two on the defensive end. Then the second-team 
linemen rotate in to the drill and repeat the process.
Changing the snap count often will help the offensive blocker and will 
also make the defensive lineman watch the football. The center uses a 
shotgun snap (snapping the ball to the manager) on each repetition so 
the defensive lineman sees the ball being snapped.

142
Set With Weighted Ball
The lineman gets in a great three-point stance while holding a 6-pound 
weighted ball in both hands. On the command of “set, hut,” the lineman 
takes either a post set or kick set and chest passes the weighted ball to a 
teammate. The lineman should end up in a perfect pass protector position. 
He freezes in this position until the coach releases him. The lineman’s 
partner then repeats the drill, passing the ball back to him.
Coaching Points
I prefer that players use more kick sets than post sets because the kick 
set is more difficult. Because guards should use a three-point stance all 
the time except during the 2-minute offense, guards should do more work 
down in a three-point stance rather than up in a two-point stance. The 
tackles should work more out of a two-point stance than a three-point 
stance.
When working out of a two-point stance, linemen must learn to stay 
down in a good bent-knee position without bending their back. Both post 
and kick sets are a two-step slide.
The lineman must be sure to work with tight elbows and execute a 
basketball-style chest pass. He should aim the pass to hit his partner in 
the face mask. The lineman needs to stay in great football position while 
executing the drill.
Set and Pass the Ball
Each lineman works with a partner. The lineman holds a weighted ball in 
both hands. He can begin the drill in a two- or three-point stance. On the 
command “set, hut,” the lineman executes a post or kick set. This time he 
continues to post or kick set for four or five steps with his partner as they 
pass the ball back and forth. Linemen should post set for two repetitions 
and kick set for three or four repetitions of the drill so they get more kick 
sets than post sets.

143
Sumo Pass Protection in the Hoops
This is the favorite off-season 
drill for many offensive linemen. 
Place a hoop on a yard line so 
the hoop is split down the middle. 
One offensive lineman stands on 
one side of the line in the hoop, 
and another lineman stands on 
the other side of the line in the 
hoop (figure 11.10a).
Players must keep their 
heads back; there are no head 
butts. Each lineman places one 
hand in the armpit of the other 
lineman. The outside hand is 
placed on the outside of the 
partner’s upper arm (figure 
11.10b).
On the command “go,” each 
player tries to throw the other 
out of the hoop (figure 11.10c). 
The player must sink his hips 
and really try to hold his center of 
gravity. After the players go, they 
are free to use hand replace-
ments on each other—whatever 
they need to do to get the other 
out of the hoop.
Coaching Points
This drill will show which players 
give second and third efforts. A 
quitter will have a very difficult 
time with this drill. This is a very 
competitive drill that indicates 
who is tough and who likes to 
compete. To help avoid head butts, the players can begin with their heads 
offset on each other’s shoulders.
Keep score of wins and losses. Create an elimination tournament to find 
out who is King of the Hoops.

Kick Slide Three-Man Punch
This drill is used to help guards, tackles, and centers work on the kick 
slide set. A lineman lines up on a yard line. (Two linemen can do this drill 
at the same time.) Three defenders stand to one side, spaced out 2 to 3 
yards and staggered in alignment (figure 11.11a).
On the command “set, hut,” the lineman kick slides and punches the 
number 1 defender (figure 11.11b). After punching number 1, the lineman 
continues the kick slide and punches number 2, then he kick slides and 
punches number 3 (figure 11.11, c and d). After the lineman punches the 
number 3 defender, he should lock up and finish this defender off to the 
outside.

Tackles can use the same procedure to work on vertical pass sets. Two 
tackles line up on a yard line. Three defenders stand to one side, spaced 
out 2 to 3 yards and staggered. On the command “set, hut,” the tackles 
punch the number 1 defender and then the number 2 defender. When 
the tackles get to the number 3 defender, they punch the defender, lock 
him up, and finish him off to the outside.

Run Blocking in the Hoops
This is a great lower-body drill that helps players learn to sink their hips 
and keep a high-quality base. Place a hoop on a yard line so the hoop 
is split down the middle. One offensive lineman stands on one side of 
the line in the hoop, and another lineman stands on the other side of the 
line in the hoop.
Each player should be in a balanced two-point stance. The players 
should offset their heads so they have an ear-to-ear relationship and 
their heads are aligned with each other’s shoulders but not touching. 
Each lineman has his hands on his thighs. On the command “set, hut,” 
each lineman tries to get his hands inside the other’s hands and drive 
the other out of the hoop. The linemen must be sure to keep their hips 
low and keep a wide base with leverage.
Coaching Points
This drill will show which players give second and third efforts. A quitter 
will have a very difficult time with this drill. The drill will also indicate which 
players have great command of their hands (i.e., the players who get their 
hands inside the other player’s hands at the start of the drill).
Keep score of wins and losses. Create an elimination tournament to 
find out who is King of the Run Blockers.

Pass Protection  147
Five-Man Sled
The five-man sled can be used when the offensive linemen need leg work 
and need to improve their leg drive. (Alternatively, the five-man wheel 
trainer could be used.) Change the snap count with each repetition. Start 
with four 5- to 10-yard drives, then rotate the second group into the drill.
The players should reset after 5 yards. They should change the foot 
used for the lead step. My linemen do two left-foot runs to each right-foot 
run, if possible. The linemen should keep the shoulder pads low, keep 
the back flat, and use tight elbows with great punch. They should always 
use powerful, choppy steps and maintain a good wide base.
Coaching Points
If things aren’t going well and the coach needs to get the players’ atten-
tion, he can have the players drive the sled for an extensive time. When 
the coach calls the snap count, the players come off and drive the sled 
the length of the field. Two or three shots of this will get their attention. I 
use this about two times a season, and things always seem to pick up.
Linemen may be offset to the right or left. If they are, they should use 
zone steps to execute the block on the sled.
Summary
Pass protection needs to be aggressive and solid. This chapter covered 
several types of pass sets, techniques, and drills. Learning the proper 
way to perform pass protection drills will help the offensive lineman 
improve and refine his skills. And when the linemen are skillful in this 
area, it makes for a very happy quarterback. In the next chapter, pass 
progression and drills will be covered. Several drills will be broken down 
and explained so the lineman understands his purpose during pass 
progression. Many of these drills will simulate real football situations.

Pass 
Progression 
and Drills
This chapter presents a seven-step progression of drills that will 
help offensive linemen develop their skills in pass protection. We work 
on this progression of drills every day in fundamental and individual 
practices. Each one of these phases has its own value and will help an 
offensive lineman become a better pass protector.
The pass progression drills are as follows:
1.	Shuffle mirror
2.	Push–pull
3.	Pressure hop
4.	Combination
5.	Punch
6.	Sandbags
7.	Tap

150  Complete Offensive Line
Each phase of this pass progression work focuses on certain areas 
pertaining to pass protection. In the shuffle mirror drill, linemen work 
on body balance as well as good movement of the feet. The push–pull 
drill helps with body control and staying balanced. Pressure hop helps 
linemen learn how to stop a bull rusher and how to control their body 
to stop a powerful force coming at them. The combination drill puts all 
of the phases together and allows the linemen to practice working in a 
realistic gamelike situation. The sandbags are great for learning a punch 
while still controlling the upper body. Punching is a big part of pass pro-
tection, and the punch drill is used to work on timing and balance during 
the punch. The tap drill also allows linemen to work on the timing of the 
punch. These seven steps will help linemen break down the individual 
segments of pass protection and then combine them together.
All of the drills are run out of the two-cone setup. Two cones should 
be set 6 yards apart. Once the drill is set up, the centers should partner 
up first down the line behind the cones, followed by the guards and 
then the tackles.
The partners will sprint into the drill on the coach’s command. When 
they receive the command “back,” they will sprint out of the drill to the 
outside. If the partners don’t sprint into and out of the drill, the coach 
may have them do up-downs or may kick them out of the drill.
In this chapter, each progression drill is broken down, including 
descriptions of the procedure and purpose for each drill along with 
coaching points.
Shuffle Mirror
The shuffle mirror is also known as mirror dodge or chase the rabbit. Two 
cones are needed. Set the cones 6 or 7 yards apart. Draw a chalk line or 
use a yard line out on the football field. The offensive lineman can crowd 
the line but must never go over.
The offensive lineman gets in a great two-point stance with both hands 
behind his back. He gets in position so his shoulders are over his knees 
(figure 12.1). The lineman should stage his stance according to the side 
he plays on. He should get his head up and get in good ready football 
position. He should never look at the defender’s head. Big eyes are a 
must, just like in the run game. The lineman must read the defender’s 
numbers. The defender will line up directly in front of the lineman and 
off the line about a yard. This is done so there will be space in between 
the two players.

151
On the command “go,” the 
defender moves quickly be-
tween the two cones. The offen-
sive lineman leads with his 
direction-side foot. For example, 
if the defender goes to the line-
man’s right, the lineman will 
lead with the right foot. This is 
not a hop or pound. The lineman 
shuffles squarely to the “rabbit,” 
mirroring him perfectly. The 
lineman must keep his hands 
locked behind his back all the 
way through the drill. This will 
help the player learn to con-
trol his upper body. When the 
defender stops to go in another 
direction, the lineman plants his 
play-side foot and leads back out with the opposite foot. The defender 
works the offensive lineman from cone to cone. The defender should 
stay square to the cones and to the offensive lineman. This enables the 
blocker to read the defender’s numbers. The defender might turn slightly, 
but he should try to stay frontal as much as possible.
Coaching Points
The biggest challenge for the lineman will be shifting to the lead foot. The 
lineman may need to slow down until he gets the feel of leading with the 
near foot. He should step to the right with the right foot, shift his weight, 
and then step with the right foot again. If the lineman is moving to the right 
and the “rabbit” suddenly changes to move to the left, the lineman must 
step with his left foot to change directions. He must not step under his body 
with the right foot. Once the lineman has a feel for the drill, he should turn 
it loose and let go. Being efficient in the footwork—maintaining quick and 
active feet—is the most important element of the drill. The lineman must 
not get the shoulders leaning to the right when going right or to the left 
when going left. He should try to let his shoulders ride between his legs 
and should stay as controlled as possible without letting his body lean.
Figure 12.1  Shuffle mirror.

152
Push–Pull
Linemen can use this drill to find their center of gravity and balance. The 
lineman gets into his stance as in the shuffle mirror drill. He puts his right 
hand behind his back and grabs his left wrist. He gets into a great stag-
gered stance. He should stagger the foot back according to the side of the 
offensive line he plays on. 
The partner puts one hand 
on the lineman’s shoulder 
on the same side as the 
lineman’s back leg and puts 
his other hand behind the 
lineman’s neck (figure 12.2).
When the lineman gets in 
a great stance, he freezes 
in the stance. He should 
lock his core. When the 
partner pulls the lineman 
forward, the lineman posts 
forward and goes with the 
pull, taking two post steps 
forward but keeping good 
body position. When the 
partner pushes the lineman back, the lineman plants his feet and presses 
his shoulder against the pushing hand. The key to the drill is to be strong 
in the lower back and fight to stay in that locked-in stance. The drill starts 
when the partner pushes the lineman’s shoulder back. The blocker may 
have a tendency to let the shoulder turn—he must not do this! No matter 
what pressure is put on him, the lineman must work hard to keep his 
shoulders square and to maintain a great stance as much as possible.
Coaching Points
When the partner pushes on the lineman’s shoulder, the partner should 
release the pressure on the neck. When he pulls on the lineman’s neck, 
the partner should release the pressure on the shoulder. He should try 
to pull the lineman forward (not down on the neck), trying to yank the 
lineman out of his stance. When the partner pushes the lineman back-
ward, the partner should try to raise the lineman up and make him weak 
at that point of pressure. The partner needs to stand tall and help make 
this the best drill possible. Sometimes partners have a tendency to lie 
down and pull down on the offensive lineman. The drill has to be run by 
the defender. The coach should make sure the defender doesn’t get lazy 
and hurt the blocker. The defender has to stay tall.
Figure 12.2  Push–pull.

153
Pressure Hop
Pressure hop is a drill used to practice stopping a bull rusher. This drill is 
usually performed with two offensive players and two defensive players. 
First, the defensive player should be fitted into the chest of the offen-
sive blocker. The defender fits his hands into the blocker’s armpits and 
executes a drive block (figure 12.3). The offensive blocker is upright in his 
football stance with his hands on the outsides of the partner’s shoulders. 
He should have a slight 
bend in his knees. Once 
the defender starts to 
drive block the offensive 
lineman, the lineman 
holds the defender as 
long as possible and then 
executes a short hop 
backward with both feet. 
Once the offensive player 
hops back, he again tries 
to hold off the rusher as 
long as he can until he 
has to perform a short 
hop backward and reset 
again. The two players 
should do this for four 
or five hops and then stop. There should be a lot of straining going on 
during this drill. When taking the short hop backward, the lineman should 
execute a swap of the hips like when doing a power clean. He should 
drop his hips and reset.
The defensive partner starts with a drive block at three-fourths strength. 
Once both players are able to perform the drill well, the defensive partner 
comes at the offensive man at full speed.
Coaching Points
The offensive man needs to lean slightly forward with knees slightly 
bent. The defender should fit up with his face in the numbers, bow his 
neck, get his hands in the armpits, and maintain a flat back. He should 
then execute the drive block. The defender should apply pressure on the 
blocker at all times so he learns to stop the rusher, reset his hips, and 
be ready to stop him again. This drill is a great conditioning drill and will 
force the player to really strain.
Figure 12.3  Pressure hop.

154
Combination
The combination drill is a combination of the shuffle mirror, push–pull, 
and pressure hop drills. Together these drills simulate a situation that is 
similar to what the players will experience in a real game.
The offensive blocker gets into the perfect pass blocking stance. He 
should bend his knees, hold his shoulders over his knees, keep his elbows 
tight, and stagger his feet according to the side of the line he plays on. The 
defensive partner walks up to the offensive blocker and grabs his outside 
shoulder area. The offensive blocker puts his hands into the partner’s 
chest and presses. The defensive partner grabs the outside shoulder 
and pulls. There should be constant pressure on the offensive blocker’s 
hands. On the command “go,” the defensive partner will shuffle mirror, and 
the offensive blocker will press and shuffle. The offensive blocker must 
look at the defensive partner’s numbers on all moves. After the defensive 
partner shuffles, he may bull rush so the offensive blocker has to pressure 
hop. The defensive partner may also use a pull technique to simulate 
push–pull. The coach should make sure that the defender stays tall and 
doesn’t lean forward or lie down on the blocker. It is the defender’s job to 
help the blocker have the best drill possible.
Many possible combinations can be used. For example, the defender 
may execute any of these movements:
1.	 Shuffle right
2.	 Push, pull
3.	 Shuffle left
4.	 Shuffle right
5.	 Bull rush
6.	 Shuffle left
The defensive partner should mix up his movements and really work 
the offensive blocker hard.
Coaching Points
Let the offensive blocker get himself into the best offensive pass block-
ing stance possible before the defender approaches him. Once they are 
fitted together, the two players really need to keep a lot of pressure on 
each other. To do this, the defender pulls on the blocker, and the blocker 
pushes on the defender.

155
Punch
Timing the punch and maintaining balance are very important and very 
difficult to execute. During this drill, blockers will punch hand shields or 
shoulder pads on their partner.
Players start in two lines, and the coach calls out the command “Give 
me four out.” This means two pairs of players need to be out doing the 
drill. Two players are the blockers, and two players are the partners. On 
the command “go,” the partner comes at the blocker, and the blocker 
punches the hand shield when the partner is close. If the players are 
wearing shoulder pads, the partner should put his hands behind his back 
and then rush and take the punch. The blocker tries to maintain a great 
pass set and be ready to strike. He must not punch too quickly and get 
overextended. This can be an early issue. Another issue is punching too 
late and letting the defender get on top of the blocker. Each player should 
be aware of his arm length and just how quickly or slowly he should be 
punching the hand shield or shoulder pad.
When the blocker strikes the punch, he needs to give ground, reset, and 
be ready to strike again. Players should do this for four or five punches 
and then rotate.
Coaching Points
The biggest problem that 
players have in this drill is 
dropping their hands after 
striking a punch. Guards 
and centers must always 
carry their hands high and 
in a boxing strike position. 
Tackles must learn to strike 
with both hands from their 
belt buckles. Tackles may 
reset their hands to the point 
of the belt buckle as shown 
in figure 12.4.
As players perfect the 
drill, they should speed it up 
to get the rhythm of punch 
and reset. They should always keep their head up and keep big eyes on 
the target. They will not hit what they cannot see.
Figure 12.4  Resetting the hands to the belt 
buckle.

156
Sandbags
Sandbags are the perfect aid for helping linemen learn a great pass set. 
We do post, vertical, and kick sets while using sandbags as a teaching aid.
In two lines, players pair up behind two cones. On the command “go,” 
two players jump out with the sandbags in their hands, ready to execute 
the drill. On the command “set hit,” the centers take off together in one 
direction and perform a kick slide (figure 12.5a). They punch the sandbag 
forward each time the lead foot hits the ground. They repeat this step and 
punch for five or six steps at an angle of their kick slide step. The kick 
slide is the only set the centers use; they never use a post set. Guards 
and tackles use the post set (figure 12.5b).
The guards and tackles will be back to back when executing the post 
set. On the post set, they should post into the line of scrimmage with a 
punch and replace. They should execute the post steps five or six times 
down the line of scrimmage.
On the second set, the centers kick slide to their left. Again, they are 
lined up behind each other so they can go in the same direction. The 
guards and tackles kick slide in the appropriate direction according to 
which side they play on. Usually on Wednesdays, we have the tackles and 
guards perform the vertical set. The tackles and guards do the kick slide 
and hold off the post set. When using the vertical pass set, the tackles set 
back three or four steps. The guards set back two or three steps. Once 
again, the linemen should punch when the lead foot hits the ground.
Figure 12.5  Sandbags: (a) centers; (b) guards and tackles.
a
b

157
When the offensive linemen take their regular pass set stance, they 
should be holding the sandbags. They should keep elbows tight and 
arms at a 30- to 40-degree angle. When the offensive blocker performs 
the kick step or post step, he should punch the sandbag with that first 
step. For example, if the blocker kick slides to the left, he should punch 
the sandbag every time the left foot leads out and hits the ground.
Once the step is taken and the sandbag is extended, the lineman should 
make sure the arm is not extended over 80 degrees and never closer 
than 30 degrees. This will ensure a tight, short, and powerful punch. It 
will also help the lineman maintain balance and body control.
Coaching Points
The coach may have to stay in front of the blocker and hold his hand 
out as a target for the blocker to punch the sandbag to. This sometimes 
helps the blocker find the rhythm needed to do this drill. Regarding arm 
angles, players should be more open than closed. Most players will hold 
the bag next to their chest. Once the drill starts, the players should hold 
the bag out away from their body with an arm angle of 30 to 40 degrees.

158
Tap
Offensive linemen need to get the feel of the defender putting his arms 
around their body and still be able to time the punch. Players should do this 
drill in shoulder pads. The partner comes at the blocker, and the blocker is 
set in a great pass set, waiting to punch (figure 12.6). The partner needs 
to get close enough to reach up with both hands and tap the outside tip 
of the blocker’s shoulder pads. The partner will still take the punch from 
the offensive blocker. The partner then drops his hand and gets ready to 
reach up again and retap the blocker. Players should perform four or five 
repetitions. The offensive blocker punches and resets to strike another 
punch. When the blocker feels the arms of the defender coming to grab 
him, he learns how to time the punch. If the defender is close enough to 
grab the blocker, the defender is usually close enough to punch.
Coaching Points
Make sure the defender does not get too fast with his hands and just tap, 
tap, tap. He needs to slow down and make sure the blocker is ready to 
punch. Each tap is an individual drill in itself.

Pass Progression and Drills  159
Summary
This concludes the seven-step progression of pass protection drills. 
Offensive linemen should do these drills at least twice a week during the 
season and every day during football camp in three- or four-part phases. 
The progressions discussed will help each player become an effective 
pass blocker. The drills also allow the blocker to work on any weak parts 
of his pass blocking. At times, the shuffle mirror, sandbags, punch, and 
tap drills may be the only drills used. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss 
conditioning and core work. These are two aspects that play a key part 
in the success of an offensive lineman.

Conditioning 
and Core Work
Conditioning is one of the main factors in a lineman’s ability 
to become a great player. Conditioning comes from distance and sprint 
running. The best players are always in the best condition. Being in great 
condition allows the player to perform at the top of his game and to go 
full speed on every repetition.
A great core and a very strong back allow the player to create power 
and torque when performing. Body appearance (with a great core) and 
good health are additional reasons for wanting to be in top shape.
Linemen should run year-round to maintain their weight. Once a large 
person gets heavy, it is very difficult to get the weight off. Linemen need 
to be able to run long distances as well as the 110-yard distance.

162  Complete Offensive Line
Five Fifths
The lineman runs five fifths of a mile around the football field in a time of 
80 seconds a fifth. After each fifth, the lineman gets a 45-second break 
before he runs the next fifth. This is repeated until all five fifths are com-
pleted. Once the lineman can run five fifths in 80 seconds, his next goal 
is to drop the time down to 75 seconds, then 70 seconds. Once he can 
run five fifths in 65 seconds or less, he will be in great shape.
To set up this drill, use eight cones to mark the course on the football 
field. Set four cones on the 5-yard lines where they connect with the 
sidelines. Place the other four cones 5 yards in on the goal line to create 
a perfect curve. This distance will measure out to be a fifth of a mile. Front 
starting point after one lap is made from start to finish at the same point. 
After running five of these, the player will have completed a mile.
110s
The 110s are run in 18 seconds with a 45-second break between each 
run. The player repeats this until he has completed 15 110-yard runs. 
During the summer, players should overtrain on these by building up to 30 
sets of 110s about three-quarters of the way through summer workouts. 
Then, when they go back to running only 15 110s, it will seem effortless.
The drill starts on the line at the back of the end zone and ends on 
the opposite goal line. After crossing the goal line, the player strides out, 
turns around, and gets ready to start from the back of the end zone on 
that end of the field.
Core Stability
Core stability should be a primary area of focus year-round. The first 
step is to identify the core and the targeted areas. The human core con-
sists of the abdominal muscles, the right and left obliques, and the mid 
to lower back. Just as every lineman is different in the way he runs or 
blocks, each lineman’s core strength will separate him as an athlete and 
in his ability to dominate on the field. A strong and stable core will allow 
a lineman to be more mobile with his steps because of the balance and 
stability he will gain. Core stability also allows the lineman to execute 
more powerful blocks because the core support helps him deliver each 
shock during play.

Front Plank
Lie on your abdomen. Cup your hands to make a pyramid with your 
elbows underneath your chest. Your legs and feet are together. Rise up 
on your toes and lift your body off the ground (figure 13.1). Keep your 
head down to ensure a flat back. Hold for 90 seconds, then lower to the 
ground. Complete two or three repetitions.

Plate V-Up
Lie on your back with your legs straight out and feet together. Hold a 
25-pound weight plate in both hands with arms extended straight up 
from your chest in front of your face (figure 13.2a). Raise your legs and 
lift your shoulders off the ground, touching the weight plate to your feet 
as your body forms a V (figure 13.2b). Do not let the weight generate any 
momentum. Remember, you want to have a strong core and then use it. 
Do two sets of 25 repetitions.

Lie on your back with your hands behind your head. Lift both legs off the 
ground with one leg straight and the other leg bent. Bring the opposite 
elbow toward the bent knee (figure 13.3a). Rotate your legs and elbows, 
bringing the other knee up toward the opposite elbow (figure 13.3b). You 
can either time the exercise and perform two sets of 45 seconds each 
or count the number of times the elbow moves toward the knee (right 
elbow to left knee and left elbow to right knee equals one repetition) and 
perform two sets of 18 repetitions.

Stability Ball Toss
Lie flat on your back. Hold a stability ball between your legs (figure 13.4a). 
Lift your legs slightly off the ground and your arms straight above your 
head slightly off the ground. Lift your legs to bring the ball to meet your 
hands in the middle (like a V). Grab the ball with your hands (figure 13.4b) 
and return to the start position (figure 13.4c). Return the ball to your legs 
by lifting your hands and grabbing the ball with your legs. One round trip 
(ball from legs to hands and from hands to legs) is one repetition. Perform 
two sets of 15 repetitions.

Entire Core 
Hanging Knee Raise
This exercise not only builds core strength, but also improves grip strength, 
shoulder strength, and mental toughness. You will need a squat rack. 
Chalk up your hands to help keep your grip. Hang from the top of the 
rack so your feet do not touch the ground (figure 13.5a). Keep your toes 
flexed and your feet out in front to avoid swinging between repetitions. 
Bring your knees up toward your chest (figure 13.5b) and pause for a 
two count. Extend your legs, keeping your feet off the ground. Perform 
two sets of 20 repetitions.
Figure 13.5  Hanging knee raise: (a) starting position; (b) lifting knees toward chest.
For a more advanced version, keep the legs straight, lifting your straight 
legs up past your belly button.
To develop mental toughness and core stability, hang with your knees 
or legs up for 1 minute.

Side Plank
Get into the up position described for a front plank (page 163). Rotate to 
the right side so your bent right arm is on the ground aligned with your 
chest but your hand is in front of your chest. Place your left arm on your 
left hip (figure 13.6a). Your left leg will be stacked on top of your right leg. 
Keep your body straight and keep your right hip off the ground for 90 
seconds. Return to the front plank position and repeat, rotating to the left 
side (figure 13.6b). Perform two or three sets on each side.

Resisted Side Bend
Grab a 45-pound weight plate. Stand 
with your feet on the ground and the 
45-pound plate in one hand. Place 
your free hand on your hip. Keep-
ing your legs straight, bend to the 
weighted side (figure 13.7). Remem-
ber not to bend your legs when bend-
ing to the weighted side because 
this will cause you to push off the 
legs instead of pulling with the free 
oblique. Return to the start position 
and repeat to the same side. After 10 
repetitions, switch sides. Perform two 
sets of 10 repetitions on each side.

Bench Oblique Rise
You will need a partner for this exercise. Lie down on your right hip on a 
flat bench so your upper torso hangs off the bench (figure 13.8a). Your 
partner braces your legs. Cross your hands over your chest and let your 
head and shoulders hang toward the ground. Extend up (figure 13.8b). 
Squeeze at the top position for a two count and then control yourself as 
you return to the start position. Perform 10 repetitions on your right side 
and then switch sides. Perform two sets of 10 repetitions on each side.

Stand, holding a barbell that is end over end. Grab the top of the barbell. 
Slightly bend your knees and keep your arms straight and locked out. 
Rotate from side to side (figure 13.9), lowering the barbell as far as pos-
sible while keeping the arms locked out. If the arms start to bend, you are 
going too low and defeating the purpose of the exercise. Lowering the 
barbell to the right and then to the left equals one repetition. Complete 
two sets of 20 repetitions.

This exercise also develops the groin muscles because of the pressure 
applied to the stability ball. Perform 12 repetitions, then switch sides. 
Perform two sets of 12 repetitions on each side.

Get down on all fours, with your knees and hands flat. Your head should 
be flat, eyes looking to the ground. Have a coach or partner place a PVC 
pipe between your shoulder blades so it is in line with your rear end. The 
pipe will measure your stability and balance while you are flexed in an 
uncomfortable position. Once the PVC pipe is placed, lift your right arm 
and left leg (figure 13.14a), pushing each limb straight back. If your limbs 
drift or the PVC pipe falls, there is a flaw in your exercise technique. Point 
with the extended arm and flex the toe of the extended foot. Hold for a 
two count, return to start position, and switch sides, lifting the left arm and 
right leg (figure 13.14b). Perform two sets of 20 repetitions on each side.

Balance Ball
This is a total core exercise that also builds a strong groin and improves 
balance. Grab a stability ball. If you are a beginner, start against a wall 
or another firm object that you can 
brace yourself on until you are able 
to balance on your own. Place both 
knees on the stability ball. Find your 
balance with your hips extended and 
your back straight. Squeeze the ball 
with your knees to help keep your 
body stable and balanced. Place your 
hands on your head (figure 13.17). 
Hold this position for 1 minute. Per-
form two sets.
For a more advanced version, have 
your coach or a partner lightly tap 
your abdomen, elbows, or other parts 
of your body to test your balance. Or 
toss a light medicine ball to a partner. 
When you become truly advanced, 
you can progress from the knee 
position to a standing position on the 
stability ball.

Summary
The core is the most important muscle group in the body because all 
power and force are generated through the core area. A player with a 
strong core and a strong back will be a much stronger football player.
Offensive linemen should remember core flexibility in every exercise 
they do. Bodybuilders condition their muscles for performance by con-
stantly flexing between sets to build muscle endurance. The same concept 
applies to core endurance in football: The more the player’s core endures, 
the easier it is to build on.
This book began with instructions for the offensive lineman on the 
proper way to get in a stance and make all the run blocks that a lineman 
needs to make. We have covered all phases of pass protection and the 
drills to help linemen learn pass protection. Drills for practicing pass 
protection, blitzes, and twist games were also covered. In addition, we’ve 
discussed conditioning for linemen as well as core stabilization.
If a player wants to become a great offensive lineman, he needs to be 
the guy who outworks everyone! Hard work and sweat are the way to 
become a really good offensive lineman. If a player also has some skill 
and natural talent, he can become great!
