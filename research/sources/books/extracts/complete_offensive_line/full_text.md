To all my former, current, and future offensive linemen. As 
I convey to every player, our relationship starts out with us 
liking each other, then it may go through a phase of us not 
liking each other, but then, hopefully, it becomes a coach–
player love for each other as we appreciate what both of us 
have gained and learned from our relationship.

I thank Garin Justice, my former player and graduate assistant, 
for his input in the beginning stages of this book. Garin “Big Oak” was 
scheduled to assist with this endeavor before he was offered a full-time 
coaching position at Concord University, where he is currently the head 
football coach. I also want to thank Florida State University for graciously 
allowing their facilities and equipment to be used for the photos. I want 
to thank the models for their part in the photo demonstrations. Most of 
all I want to thank my family, my wife Tara and my sons Travis, Chance, 
and Clint for their continued support in whatever adventures this crazy 
life may throw our way.

Introduction
Starting out, I thought the defensive side of the ball was going to 
be my path in football. I played defense when I was in high school and 
college. My professional coaching career began in 1973 at Glenville State 
College. In 1975, I was the head freshman coach and defensive coordina-
tor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. At that time, it seemed that 
a career on the defensive side of the ball was my future. I had no idea 
that becoming an offensive coach was ahead of me. In my playing and 
coaching careers, I have had the opportunity to work with many suc-
cessful coaches on both sides of the ball.
In 1976, West Virginia University had an opening for a part-time 
tight-ends coach. Back then, a part-time position was a small step 
above a graduate assistant. I interviewed with coach Frank Cignetti. We 
seemed to hit it off, and I got the job. The team had two offensive line 
coaches. One was Joe Pendry, who is currently the offensive line coach 
at the University of Alabama. Pendry spent many years coaching in the 
National Football League. As luck would have it, the two line coaches 
had different philosophies. In 1977, the head coach made adjustments. 
One line coach was moved to coach the tight ends, and I was moved to 
assist Coach Pendry with the offensive line. That was a defining moment 
in my career. After my first practice as an offensive line coach, I realized 
I was hooked.
I became intrigued with the offensive line for many reasons. This 
area included so many different blocking schemes, types of technique 
work, coaching strategies, steps, helmet placements, hand placements, 
and so on. You could practice all day with offensive linemen in shorts, 
even without helmets, and accomplish a lot. You can’t do the same 
on the defensive side of the ball. I love the work ethic of the offensive 
lineman. I love the way the majority of offensive linemen see the posi-
tion as one that requires a strong work ethic. The offensive lineman 
goes about his day-to-day operations knowing what he needs to do 

viii  Introduction
to be successful. Most offensive linemen are good guys—apple pie, 
Chevrolet type of guys. They seem to be blue-collar kinds of guys, the 
kind I like to coach.
I coached the O-line for 1 year. When the head coach made changes on 
the defensive side of the ball, he asked me if I would go to the defensive 
side. They needed some fire, enthusiasm, and a new approach. I was the 
young coach, thankful that Coach Cignetti gave me my start. I needed 
to do what he wanted, even though it was not my first choice. I coached 
the defensive line for 2 years, not knowing at the time that it was prob-
ably one of the best things I have done in my career. Gary Tranquill was 
defensive coordinator and one of the smartest football coaches around. 
I learned a lot about football! I learned about tying the coverages to the 
fronts, analyzing offensive percentages, field position, technical parts, and 
the thought process for a defensive coach. It was the opposite of what I 
had been teaching on offense. What a great experience! I recommend that 
any young coach work both sides of the ball, especially the side opposite 
his comfort zone. Taking on the challenge of coaching both sides of the 
football is a wonderful opportunity to learn. At West Virginia, we were 
running the split-back veer offense, zone blocking on the backside, veer 
blocking on the front side, quick-hitting plays, and a lot of play-action 
pass. This scheme was valuable for me to learn. I hadn’t been around it 
much, so I learned how to run it for 2 years and then how to defend it for 
2 years. During that time, I also made great friends among my coaching 
colleagues, including Nick Saban, currently head coach at Alabama, and 
the late Joe Daniels, assistant coach at Ohio State.
After West Virginia University, I headed for Southern Illinois Uni-
versity to coach under Rey Dempsey. Coach Dempsey was a very intel-
ligent football coach. He had two offensive line coaches; I coached the 
center, quick guard, and quick tackle. The first year, our best player was 
the strong tackle. However, at the end of the season, our center, quick 
guard, and quick tackle made the all-conference team. The other side, 
although made up of the best players, did not receive any awards. The 
other offensive line coach and I had different personalities. I approached 
Coach Dempsey and told him that this was not working for me. He gave 
me the whole offensive line, moving the other coach to the defensive line. 
I have not shared an offensive line since that time. I am not an advocate 
of having two offensive line coaches. It is not ego; I think there needs to 
be one voice, one personality for the offensive linemen. I like having all 
five play with my personality in the background.
In 1982, I moved to the University of Southern Mississippi to coach 
under Jim Carmody. We had some great players. It was a unique 

Introduction  ix
experience to work with skill players who were so talented. Reggie Col-
lier was quarterback, Sam DeJarnette was running back, and Louis Lipps 
was wide receiver. Louis went on to play with the Pittsburgh Steelers 
and was rookie of the year; he had a great career in the NFL. The defense 
had great speed. This was my first opportunity to coach in the South. It 
was an eye-opening experience to see the speed and quickness on both 
sides of the ball. This helped me set another coaching philosophy—being 
aggressive on the offensive line. We had to be an aggressive offensive 
line to be able to block players of that caliber and athletic ability.
The University of New Mexico was my next stop on the coaching 
carousel. Ben Griffith, the offensive coordinator, had come from Georgia 
Southern, where Erk Russell was the head coach. They had just won the 
national championship for Division I-AA. We put in the run-n-shoot 
offense. We were up and down the football field. We could move the 
football on anybody. We ended up third in the nation in offense. To give 
you an example of the WAC Conference at that time, we were number 
3 in the country, but number 2 in the conference behind Brigham Young 
University. This was another good experience for my coaching résumé; 
I learned new styles and different philosophies.
After my short stint at New Mexico, I was hired by Charlie Bailey at 
Memphis State University. For the next 4 years, I had the most fun of my 
coaching career. Coach Bailey was a lot like Coach Tranquill; he knew 
both sides of the football. We turned around that program. We made 
great strides in winning football games. One year we were fortunate to 
beat the University of Florida when they were undefeated, and we also 
beat Alabama when they were rolling. The time I spent at Memphis State 
University was such an enjoyable experience.
I continued on to Mississippi State University. During my first 2 years 
there, Rockey Felker was the head coach. For the next 2 years, it was 
Jackie Sherrill. Jackie decided to keep me on as the offensive line coach 
after Coach Felker was let go. I appreciated the opportunity he gave me. 
Coach Sherrill hired Watson Brown as the offensive coordinator. Watson 
Brown knows more about offensive football than most others out there. 
I always told him that he might know too much! We ran several styles 
of offense, sometimes changing from week to week. This situation made 
me learn how to teach numerous techniques. This really helped define 
and improve my teaching ability. During this 2-year period, I was able 
to get my feet underneath me and become the teacher I am today.
Auburn University was the next stop for our family. Terry Bowden, 
son of legendary Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden, was named 
the head coach, and I was the first person he hired. Our first year we 

x  Introduction
went 11-0! It was exciting to be in the Southeastern Conference and have 
such success. We were placed on probation because of the previous staff’s 
misconduct, so we were not allowed any postseason play. This was also 
the beginning of my friendship with Jimbo Fisher. Jimbo was the quar-
terback coach at that time. The next year, we won 9 straight games, so 
that made 20 in a row. We tied with Georgia after four overtimes, and 
then we lost in the last few minutes to Alabama. Because the Bowdens 
are a very close family, and we had both Tommy and Terry Bowden on 
our staff, we started out with the same offense as Florida State during 
our third year. During that time, Florida State (with quarterback Char-
lie Ward) was running the run-n-shoot spread offense with four wide 
receivers. We were also very successful in moving the football. We had 
a great tailback named Stephen Davis, so he had to be involved with the 
offense. We were a four-wide, I-formation team. We broke every offensive 
scoring record in the history of Auburn University during that year. Our 
team was extremely versatile and diverse. We could move the football 
on quite a few teams in the Southeastern Conference. We continued to 
be successful at Auburn, competing for the SEC title. However, in 1998, 
things did not go as well. The line went through several centers because 
of injuries. The team did not respond as well as expected. Coach Terry 
Bowden resigned midseason under pressure.
After considering various options in coaching, I took the head coaching 
position at my alma mater, Glenville State College. Glenville State is a 
Division II school in the West Virginia Conference. The previous 6 years 
at Auburn had been tough and pressure filled. Suddenly football was fun 
again. I was coaching players who were playing the game because they 
loved it. I was the head coach and offensive line coach. I had a center who 
was given $250 a semester for books—that was all he received. These 
were the kinds of kids who appreciated a free T-shirt. They were ecstatic 
over the smallest things. They would knock a wall down if that is what 
it took to get your approval. They didn’t ask for sweatpants or tennis 
shoes; they were happy to get a T-shirt. It was a great experience for me! 
It was good to get back to the ground roots of football. We would have 
to bus to games. I remember my first game as the head coach. It was 9 
hours away. We watched the movie Scarface two times up and two times 
back; it was the only movie we had! This job brought things back to a 
different level of coaching. After being in the Southeastern Conference, 
things were a little harder to come by here, but we sure appreciated 
everything we received.
After Glenville, Nick Saban, my friend and former colleague, called 
and asked me to come with him to Louisiana State University. I helped

him fill his staff with some familiar names. At this time, I was reunited 
with Jimbo Fisher. Jimbo and I put in a pro-style attack, I-one back. We 
got LSU going in what I like to think is the right direction. We ended 
up 8-4, with a Peach Bowl win over Georgia Tech. LSU has such great 
tradition; those people love to win ballgames.
At this time, I heard momma calling with an opportunity to return to 
West Virginia University. I was returning to my old stomping grounds. 
I went back with a young coach named Rich Rodriguez. We were going 
to run the four-wide spread offense. Regardless of our personnel, we 
were going to run it anyway. We won only three games that first year. 
We started recruiting the players we needed to run this style of offense. 
We had a young quarterback named Rasheed Marshall. We won eight 
games a season for the next 2 years and had the opportunity to play in 
bowl games. Shortly thereafter, I recruited and signed a player from 
south Alabama named Pat White. From the beginning, it was a recruiting 
battle with LSU and with the California Angels baseball team. We were 
also fortunate to get a running back named Steve Slaton and a walk-on 
fullback named Owen Schmitt. With the addition of these three playmak-
ers, we were able to have 11-win seasons 3 years in a row, including a 
BCS win in the Sugar Bowl over the University of Georgia. West Virginia 
University had experienced the best 3 years in their football history. We 
were number 2 in the nation in rushing and were continually ranked in 
the top 10. During this time, I spoke with Alex Gibbs of the Denver Bron-
cos. I had been following his coaching style and his full-zone blocking 
schemes. Coach Gibbs gave me valuable information that I continue to 
use. When you are going to take something from someone else and use 
it, I don’t believe in putting your own mark on it right away. In other 
words, we did exactly what the Denver Broncos were doing, and we 
were successful.
After 6 years at West Virginia University, I received a phone call from 
coach Bobby Bowden at Florida State. Coach Bowden asked me to be his 
offensive line coach. This had been a dream of mine for quite a while, 
but it was a tough decision. I was happy at West Virginia and had built 
a new home 15 miles from family; however, I recalled talking to players 
about chasing dreams and accomplishments, and I thought I needed to go 
forward. It was about the journey, so I decided to leave WVU for Florida 
State. Florida State was also in the process of hiring Jimbo Fisher, so we 
were together again for the third time. We decided to make changes to 
the style of offense that Florida State had been running. Jimbo let me 
bring in a lot of the running game and zone blocking schemes, inside 
and out zone.

xii  Introduction
Over my career, my teams have gone from the split-back veer to the 
power I, from one-back sets to empty sets, from the run-n-shoot to the 
spread running game, and back to a conventional pro-style offense. I have 
had a chance to do it all. I think this has helped me become a better football 
coach and enabled me to better understand pass protection, the running 
game, and overall philosophy. It has taught me to take the personnel I 
have and help them work to the best of their ability. One thing I believe 
will never change—if a team can run the football, they can do anything 
they want to do. If a team can’t run the football, that team becomes one-
dimensional and may struggle. The New England Patriots may prove 
that theory wrong, because they throw the football more than they run, 
but I’ll say it again—if a team can run the ball, they can be devastating. 
I prefer to be a 50–50 football team, but if I had to choose 60–40, I would 
choose to run 60 percent and pass 40 percent.
On the following pages, I cover the desired characteristics of an offen-
sive lineman, proper stances, various types of blocks, and effective zones. 
Pass protection and drills are also covered. This book is a synopsis of the 
knowledge I have gained throughout my coaching experience. Offensive 
line is definitely my forte. My career record and the success of my players 
speak for themselves. If you want to be a successful offensive lineman 
at the next level—whether it is the high school, college, or professional 
ranks—the following information will prove vital in helping you become 
a better player at this position.

Characteristics 
of Offensive 
Linemen
To be successful, an offensive lineman needs to have these five 
characteristics: intelligence, toughness, work ethic, good character, and 
athletic ability. A team with five players who have all five of these char-
acteristics will be difficult to beat.
Intelligence
Intelligence plays a very important role on the offensive line. Offensive 
linemen need to be football smart in addition to being able to perform 
in the classroom. Many good students are not football smart; other play-
ers are really smart on the field but don’t perform well in the classroom. 
Players who do not play smart will get beat during a game. Successful 
linemen have a balance of both classroom and football intelligence. Find 
a player who is serious about succeeding in school and who works hard 
in the classroom, and you will see the same player working hard on the 
football field. High school coaches must coach the players they have. If 
an offensive lineman has difficulty learning but the coach needs him to 

2  Complete Offensive Line
play, the coach can place him next to one of the smarter players. If all 
five offensive linemen have trouble understanding the game, the coach 
will need to keep it simple.
Film study is essential at all levels of football, from high school through 
professional. Watching film is an important basic tool for players. For 
example, an offensive tackle who will be playing against a defensive 
tackle or defensive end should study that opponent on film, focusing on 
the player’s stance, his alignments, the positions of his hands and feet, 
and his distance on and off the football. This film study will enable the 
offensive tackle to find keys that will assist him during the game. The 
coach could have the players bring in a report on Wednesdays about 
who they will be playing against that week. It is surprising how much 
information a coach can receive from the players. Watching DVDs of 
various defenses can also help offensive linemen in their preparation. 
These DVDs can be used to show how defenses are called, the cover-
ages used, and the various types of blitzes that may occur. During the 
first two meetings of fall and spring practice, I like to teach nothing but 
defense. Once the players know what the defense is doing, they have a 
better understanding of how they can attack offensively.
Toughness
Mental and physical toughness are essential characteristics for an offen-
sive lineman. These characteristics are developed through drills on the 
football field, mat programs, weight room work, and station drills. A 
player must first create a degree of mental toughness. Physical tough-
ness usually follows mental toughness. Players need to understand that 
pain is a large part of football, especially in the trenches. Players must 
be able to play with pain. (Injury is different. An injured player should 
sit out of practice or contact.)
During the season, our practices include individual coaching time 
during which only 10 players participate. A player who is not blocking 
is standing in on defense and getting blocked. Players take a lot of pride 
in helping each member of the unit perform the best block he can against 
resistance. This part of practice includes a lot of fast-paced repetitions on 
drive blocks; zone blocks to the linebackers; and reach, cutoff, and down 
blocks. It has been said that my offensive linemen do more in 40 minutes 
than others do all practice. Hydration is a very important part of practice; 
water is available all the time. The practice schedule is set up so the first 

Characteristics of Offensive Linemen  3
individual period—which includes chutes; T-boards; and work on reach 
blocks, cutoff blocks, and blocking schemes—is considered a buster. (A 
buster is an all-out grinding period. It is a gut-check, no-holds-barred, 
give-it-your-all type of period.)
After the individual run blocking period, we work on the inside run 
versus defense. At this point, the coach wants the offensive line to be 
tired. The coach wants the line to have to grind out eight plays, or two 
sets of four reps, to the point of exhaustion. After the work on the inside 
run is done, the players take a 5-minute break. Although players at other 
positions sit down during breaks, offensive linemen stand or take a knee. 
They take their helmets off for the break.
After the 5-minute break, we move on to group work. Group work is 
run at a fast tempo but not as hard as the individual period; this gives 
the linemen a chance to regroup before pass progression. Many players 
consider pass progression, a period of 12 minutes, to be more difficult 
than run progression. Pass progression is a seven-step progression of 
drills that consists of partner work, very demanding resistance, a lot of 
straining, and fast repetitions (this progression is described in chapter 
12). On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the offensive line is expected to 
be exhausted when going into one-on-one pass rush. When working 
offensive players against defensive players, the coach wants them to 
be so tired that they have to find that fourth-quarter gear. Then, during 
the game, when players hit the fourth quarter, they can say, “I’ve been 
much more tired than this,” and they can then go dominate. This doesn’t 
happen by talking about it; the coach must take the players where they 
are going to live.
The off-season program of agilities and mats consists of 60 minutes 
of pure getting after it. This includes a 3-minute break after every 16 
minutes. Players must perform each drill correctly and at full speed or 
they are required to repeat it. Each player is graded after each station 
while it is fresh in the coach’s mind. At the end of the day, a reward 
may be in order. For example, black shirts could be awarded for excel-
lence, grey shirts for average, and orange shirts for below average. This 
schedule is very demanding and requires mental toughness. The mat 
program consists of commands, feet position, and football position 
breakdowns. Players must work hard to stay in a great football posi-
tion—low with knees bent—and must be able to move and play from 
this position. Players have a tendency to play high. One idea to break 
this tendency is to have players run in pens and under ropes at the end 
of mat drills. Drills need to be set up so that if players lose focus and 

4  Complete Offensive Line
don’t concentrate, they repeat the drill. Drills are broken down like game 
situations—play hard, rest, play hard, rest. Players sprint from point A 
to point B, with an emphasis on finishing. I recently timed a player to 
determine the actual work he completed in a 60-minute workout with 
one repeat. The result was a total of 7 minutes and 40 seconds of work. 
Many players don’t know how or when to rest. This lack of knowledge 
may get them into trouble with their coaches and teammates. These 
drills will help create the team leaders and will help all players develop 
mental toughness.
Players also need to become aggressive about weights and the weight 
room. Discipline is important in the lifts and techniques. Once a week, 
we stress mental toughness in the weight room. This may involve tests 
of mental toughness, such as having two players hang from the pull-up 
bar to see who can last the longest or having them perform a four-point 
push-up to see who will be the last one. We often determine the starting 
lineup based on the order of finishing.
Work Ethic
Hard work is the basic foundation of any successful offensive line. My 
linemen often state that they are the hardest working group of linemen in 
the United States. This is the mind-set that I want my offensive linemen 
to have. My reputation for requiring my linemen to work hard is built 
on fact. Pro scouts often say that they have never seen a harder work-
ing group of offensive linemen. The pro scouts relay this message to the 
players, and this helps validate our work ethic. Similarly, ex-players and 
visiting coaches can help sell this to players. A great work ethic is one 
of the first things I look for in an offensive lineman. When recruiting, 
the question of the player’s work ethic is usually at the forefront. I tell 
players about our program. I tell them that they will be worked until 
they think they can’t go another step—and that I will then ask them to 
do more. The less dedicated player will not want to continue.
Players come from many different backgrounds—such as blue collar, 
city, or country. Some players may have a good work ethic, and some 
may not. A coach can teach kids to work hard and to be proud of their 
accomplishments. When coaching at Glenville State College, a Division 
II school, I had my players paint the field house, clean the weight room, 
and put in new lockers and floors. When they were finished, they had 
a lot of pride in what they accomplished. Hard work will help players 
win on and off the field.

Characteristics of Offensive Linemen  5
Good Character
Character is very important in a football player. A successful offensive 
line needs players with character, not players who are “characters.” My 
offensive line is called the unit. The unit is a group of unselfish people 
who are united as one, working for one goal, and being the best they 
can be. A team with five smart, athletic, and tough offensive linemen 
who have character and great work ethic will be difficult to beat on 
the football field. When recruiting, a coach needs to find those players 
who want to succeed, who believe in God and the American way. Some 
players are not as fortunate as others. They come from backgrounds and 
family situations that are less than ideal. These players have an oppor-
tunity to learn what will help them be the best they can be. The unit has 
high standards, and its members hold each other accountable for their 
actions. If a player has trouble fitting in, the coach and the players may 
need to put more effort into finding out what makes that player click. 
Adjustments may have to be made, but the end result must be favorable. 
If not, the player needs to change or leave because no single player is 
more important than the group. This type of player has usually been 
culled out by this point.
Athletic Ability
Sometimes athletic ability is the easiest characteristic to find. Finding 
an athlete with the first four characteristics is usually more difficult. 
When evaluating athletic ability, a coach should first look for quick feet. 
Wide shoulders, wide hips, and a big-bone body structure are positive 
physical attributes for a lineman. Having long arms is also a plus for a 
lineman. The coach should pay attention to hip roll, punch, and body 
balance on the finish. For example, at the college level, I would prefer 
to recruit a kid who weighs 250, 260, or 270 pounds with a good frame 
and build him up rather than recruit a player who weighs 360 pounds 
and take him down.
Athletic ability often jumps out at the coach—for example, the coach 
may see a player do something on film that he knows cannot be taught. 
It just happens. I like to see a lineman get in trouble and then recover. All 
coaches want the best athletes available, but the other four characteristics 
are also important at all levels of football. I’m willing to give up some 
athletic ability to get players with the other four qualities. Many average 
athletes who possessed the other qualities have been very successful,

even named All-American and all-conference. Some players with great 
athletic ability who lacked some of the other qualities ended up with 
issues. Great athletes sometimes have difficulty using proper technique 
consistently because they rely so much on their athletic ability. Once 
these players buy into technique, they often become All-American or 
all-pro players.
Aggressive Play
Players should take pride in using an aggressive style of play on the 
offensive line. This demonstrates how the game of football should be 
played. As in many sports, good things happen when players are aggres-
sive. I think basketball coach Bob Knight once said that if you have five 
guys playing aggressively all the time, it’s hard to pick out the one to 
call a foul on.
In zone blocking, the backside block is more difficult to make than the 
block at the point of attack. Point of attack is all the way across the board. 
The backside block is at a more difficult angle than the front-side block. 
However, if the blocks are made, this will open up the defense to allow 
big running plays. Backside cutoff blocks need to be very aggressive—
legal, but aggressive. The cut block is used to get a defensive lineman or 
linebacker on the ground. Mixing up a lot of cut blocks and angle blocks 
on level 2 and 3 will get the attention of the defenders. An offensive 
lineman should practice cut blocks on bags at every practice in shells or 
shorts. During a full-pads practice, offensive linemen should try to cut 
block as much as possible. During pass protection, it is helpful to have 
a buzzword that signals the offensive linemen to set the protection and 
cut block defenders through the mid area.
Second and third efforts by the offensive linemen are huge keys to 
success on screens, reverses, and draw plays. A coach may want to give 
an award to the lineman who has the most knockdowns each week. On 
a screen play, the lineman must stay on his block and try to take the 
defender off the screen. The offensive line needs to play for 8 seconds 
on every snap—the 8 seconds of hell. Toughness, effort, and discipline 
(referred to with the acronym TED) are apparent in a successful offensive 
line. Linemen must play past the whistle, which is especially important 
on level-2 and level-3 assignments. Players should chase defensive backs 
and linebackers until someone tells them to stop. Offensive linemen can 
maximize their effectiveness by using this style of play, but to do so, they 
must be in great condition.

Running the Football
Conditioning leads into the next phase of my philosophy, which involves 
being able to run the football. The offensive team must be able to run the 
ball at anytime, especially when the opponent knows that the offense has to 
run the ball. The 4-minute offense is a phase that a team must work on every 
week so that they learn how to control the clock and win the football game.
Nothing upsets me more than having to punt the football to the 
opponent with time left in the game, especially if the opponent still has 
a chance to win. The chutes and T-board drills covered later will teach 
players to come off the football. Danny Ford, when he was at Clemson, 
once taught me a lesson about coming off the football. He said that if a 
golfer is not very good at putting, then the golfer should practice putting. 
The same goes for football. If the offensive lineman wants to be good at 
coming off the football, the lineman needs to practice coming off the ball.
At practices, coaches should talk about coming off the ball from the 
time practice starts until the time it ends. Players cannot hear this enough.
Football players often have insight on specific plays that can be effec-
tive. When it is third and 1 and players tell the coach to run Stretch 48, 
the coach knows that the players will make it work the majority of the 
time. What is your team’s money maker? When the game is tight and 
you need 1 yard, which running play can you always depend on? If you 
change week to week, game to game, you don’t have a money maker. 
Ideally, a team should have two or three plays in its repertoire for this 
situation, but the team still needs to have the one money maker play that 
will consistently get the first down.
If the offensive line unit is slacking when coming off the ball, the 
coach can run a drill called four downs. The first group lines up in the 
chutes. Everything—stance, snap count, come-off, finish, and sprint 
back—should be perfect in the drill. When the snap count is called, the 
line comes off and then drives their man (a second-team player holding 
the hand shield) down the board. When the coach yells the command 
“huddle,” the players sprint back to line up in the chute. Players must 
sprint. They line up as quickly as they can. The coach then calls out, for 
example, “second down on two, ready, blue 81, blue 81, set, hut hut,” 
and the players repeat the same process they did on first down. If the 
stance, takeoff, snap count, finish, and sprint back were perfect, the 
process is repeated for third and fourth down. If anyone jumps on any 
down, the drill starts over. This drill will make or break an offensive 
line. Some groups have had to do as many as 25 or more to finish. It is 
a great conditioner for the linemen. Leaders will emerge from this drill.

Quarterback Protection
A great offense must have a balanced attack and must be able to run and 
pass the ball with the same amount of effectiveness. For the offensive 
linemen, pass protection involves having the will and desire to prevent 
the defender from touching the quarterback. When it comes to pass 
protection, an offensive lineman’s first goal should be to not give up a 
sack the entire season. On my team, we reward players for giving up no 
sacks. The unit is rewarded when a certain number of passes are thrown 
without a sack. If the offensive line can protect the quarterback, it’s almost 
impossible for the defensive secondary to cover all receivers, therefore 
resulting in more completions.
To be a great pass blocking team, the players must use teamwork 
and communication. The saying “congestion is your friend” means that 
the more people banging into one another, the better chance to get the 
defensive linemen off course. Players must learn to anticipate the twist 
game, which refers to an exchange of gap responsibilities between two 
or three defensive linemen. When the defensive tackle goes first and the 
defensive end loops inside, this is referred to as T, E. During a twist, the 
defensive end may go through the guard–tackle gap while the tackle 
loops to the outside for containment in the C gap. The defensive linemen 
may use the twist game more often in third-down situations in an effort 
to get to the quarterback. If the offense goes with an empty backfield in 
which everyone is out for a pass except the quarterback, the twist game 
becomes automatic. Offensive linemen can gain a lot of information 
about the twist game by studying film on alignments. They should note 
specific aspects of the defensive linemen’s alignment, such as their hand 
positions, whether they have balanced or unbalanced feet, and their 
depth on and off the football. Each unit must acknowledge that a blitz or 
twist is possible on every pass play. If the unit anticipates blitz or twist 
on every pass, the unit should be ready if the blitz or twist occurs. If the 
blitz doesn’t happen, the linemen at least know that they were prepared.
Knowing your role in the pocket is a big part of pass protection. The 
center and the two guards are responsible for the depth of the pocket. 
The desired depth of the pocket is only 2 to 3 feet from the line of scrim-
mage. When the offensive line is pushed back too much, the quarterback 
is unable to step up into the pocket; this often results in a sack. The tack-
les are responsible for the width of the pocket. They maintain the width 
by using a jump pass set, a kick slide set, or a vertical pass set. Working 
against the tackles, most defensive ends try to push the pocket as the 
defensive tackles do the same on the offensive guards. The quarterback’s 

Characteristics of Offensive Linemen  9
spot in the pocket is only 9 yards from the ball. If the quarterback gets 
deeper than 9 yards, it becomes extremely difficult for the tackles to 
protect the quarterback.
In a short-setting offensive line, the guards and the center are on drop-
back pass protection. This means they will be set quick and firm on the 
line of scrimmage. We will cover exact techniques later in the book. The 
tackles use a kick slide pass set or the vertical pass set, depending on 
twist or no twist, to maintain the width of the pocket.
Body positioning is very important in pass protection. Offensive line-
men must control their aggression, keep their feet alive, and not overset 
their man. One of the biggest mistakes an offensive lineman can make 
is oversetting, or moving and getting out of position. The lineman must 
make the defender run through or around him to get to the quarterback. 
He must never give up the inside rush lanes.
Summary
A successful offensive lineman will have the following five characteristics: 
intelligence, toughness, work ethic, good character, and athletic ability. 
If these are present, there is gold at the end of the rainbow! Remember, 
aggressive play and the ability to run the football are vital in a success-
ful offense. Conditioning is also a factor in a team’s ability to have an 
accomplished running game. An offensive lineman must never slack 
when coming off the ball. He must also learn the best way to protect the 
quarterback. To be successful, offensive linemen must become skilled 
in the correct stance for the running and passing games, which will be 
covered in the next chapter.

Stances
Offensive linemen are required to execute numerous blocking 
schemes in the run and passing games. They must be able to quick set 
on passes, zone step on runs, pull on boots or sweeps, and down block 
on gap plays. My one pet peeve as a line coach is when players use an 
incorrect stance. If a player does not have a good stance, everything 
else he learns will be useless, or he will not be able to obtain the desired 
degree of perfection.
The center uses a two-point stance with his hand on the football. 
Guards use the three-point stance most of the time. In goal-line situations, 
guards use the four-point stance. During a 2-minute drill at the end of the 
game, guards get into a two-point stance. The tackle is in a three-point 
stance as long as he is covered on the line of scrimmage by a tight end. 
If there is no tight end, the offensive tackle is in a two-point stance. The 
only time this changes is when the offense is backed up on the goal line 
or is inside the 4-yard line and attempting to score. In those situations, 
the tackles should be in a three-point stance.
A four-point stance is not used as much in football today as in the 
past. However, on short-yardage plays, such as a quarterback sneak, the 
offensive linemen will often get into a four-point stance. This stance keeps 
the players’ shoulders square and low to help make the play successful.

12  Complete Offensive Line
Down Stance
The first thing players must learn is that they need to show the same 
stance on every play. The defense should not be able to read run or pass. 
If one look is given, it should be a run stance.
To assume the proper stance, a lineman should stand and position his 
feet slightly wider than his shoulders (figure 2.1). He must make sure he 
doesn’t get his feet too wide. The toes need to be slightly turned in (figure 
2.2) so the big toe can be used to push off and provide the best start. Think 
of a sprinter getting into the starting blocks. The sprinter’s feet are set 
to come off the big toe. There are no duck stances in the starting blocks.
Figure 2.1  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulders.
Figure 2.2  Turn toes in slightly.

Stances  13
To show the players what works, I sometimes have the biggest lineman 
on the team help me perform a demonstration. I turn the lineman’s feet 
out really wide, put my hands on his chest, and tell him to lean against 
me and drive block me. The lineman, even at 300 pounds or more, will 
not be able to move me (at 160 pounds) with his feet in this position. 
Once I let him turn his toes in, I can’t come close to stopping his block. 
A live visual demonstration like this brings home the point to players.
After positioning the feet, the lineman should then move into the squat 
position (figure 2.3). The lineman’s hands should be cupped, and his 
forearms should be on his thighs. His back is completely flat.
Figure 2.3  Move into squat position: (a) front view; 
(b) side view.

a

14  Complete Offensive Line
The lineman’s knees should be under his breast. He can pretend that he 
has magnets on the inside of each knee and that they are pushing against 
each other. The ankle, knee, and thigh should make a Z shape, creating a 
power angle. A lineman must use power angles in making blocks.
The lineman should now relax and get out of the stance. Players can 
use the following exercise to work on correct hand placement: The player 
bends over to the ground and picks up an imaginary basketball. He palms 
the ball with the hand that he uses as his down hand in the stance. A 
right-handed player who has used a right-handed stance since he started 
playing football should use a right-handed stance. The same applies for 
the left-handed player. Left tackles will often use a right-handed stance. 
It is surprising how weak some players’ hands and fingers are when 
starting this drill. The player should stand as if he is palming a basketball 
to get the feel of how the hand should be positioned when it is placed 
on the ground. When palming a basketball, the player’s fingers have to 
get as far apart from each other as possible while the palm maintains a 
shape that fits the roundness of the ball.
Develop Strong Hands
Lack of strength in the hands is a big problem for many football players. 
The goal is to have pure strength with the ability to grip like a vice. This 
can be developed through the use of sand. Fill two garbage cans with 
sand. Using both hands at the same time, the player squeezes the sand 
for 100 repetitions. He should use a deliberate grip and fast repetitions. 
Rice is a good alternative to sand. Place some rocks or a box at the 
bottom of the can to help stabilize the can and to use up some of the 
volume so you don’t have to use as much rice. Players should do two 
sets on three days a week.
The lineman should repeat the process of getting into the stance: He 
stands with the feet slightly wider than the shoulders, turns the toes 
in, and squats with cupped hands and with the forearms on the thighs, 
keeping a flat back. Now he places the down hand slightly inside the foot 
to the hand’s side—right hand by right foot or left hand by left foot. The 
coach should check to see if air is under the hand and fingertips. Placing 
the hand wider allows a lineman to have square shoulders in relation 
to the line of scrimmage. This goes back to being perfectly balanced in 
the stance. I’m not a proponent of using a left-handed stance on the left 
side of the line of scrimmage unless the player is left-handed. By using 
a parallel, balanced stance, a right-handed player on the left side of the 
line should have no problem.

Stances  15
An offensive lineman should strive to have a totally balanced stance 
with 33 percent of his weight on each leg and 33 percent on the down 
hand. This totals 99 percent, leaving 1 percent in the player’s plum bob 
(you figure it out). A player should watch himself when getting into his 
stance. Players often have a tendency to roll into the stance. This will place 
too much weight on the down hand, resulting in an imbalanced stance. 
The player can correct this problem by getting in the squat position first. 
Once in this position, he works his butt from side to side while placing 
his hand out in front on the ground. The habit of rolling forward into the 
stance is a habit that a lineman must break early. The head should be up, 
with eyes toward the eyebrows looking at the defender (figure 2.4). The 
off arm should rest on the thigh with the hand inside the framework of the 
body. This will allow quick use of the hands and will keep them inside.
Figure 2.4  Down stance: (a) front view; (b) side view.

a

16  Complete Offensive Line
The lineman should set in the stance and get a feel for shifting his 
weight. He should practice by picking up the right foot then the left foot 
or picking up the down hand while maintaining his balance.
A player who cannot physically get into the desired stance can simply 
make small adjustments that will allow him to be successful. An extremely 
tall player should spread his feet out wider. A player with extremely stiff 
ankles and hips can use a small stagger in his stance. First, the player 
should attempt a toe-to-instep stagger. He may have to slightly widen 
the base. An extremely tall player who has a narrow body type may need 
to use a stagger that moves his foot back to the heel. However, players 
should use the toe-to-heel stance as a last resort because it puts the player 
at a major disadvantage when using a stretch step to the inside. A player 
who uses the toe-to-heel stagger may have to use more of a drop step 
to gain position when making blocks to his inside. The term drop step 
is used very loosely. When trying to cut off or reach a defender who is 
lined up wide on the offensive lineman, the offensive lineman must give 
ground with his play-side foot and leg to gain the angle needed to block 
the defender. The player must give some ground to gain some ground. 
This step is still more of a stretch step to the outside than an actual drop 
of the foot straight back. The lineman is basically opening his hips on 
the proper angle to the defender.
Up Stance
The up stance, or two-point stance, is used by an offensive tackle who 
is not covered by a tight end. For an offensive tackle, being in an up 
stance is beneficial when he has to block a speed rusher off the edge. As 
in the down stance, the feet should be slightly more than shoulder-width 
apart. The outside leg is slightly outside the framework of the body, but 
not extremely. In the two-point stance, the lineman drops the outside 
foot back. He starts out toe to instep and no farther than toe to heel. A 
big stagger creates problems with cutoff blocks or zone blocks in the 
scheme. Once the feet are aligned properly, the lineman goes to squat 
position. The drop foot should be in the ground if possible, but many 
players have physical restrictions that make this challenging. A player 
may need to slightly widen his stance or slightly twist his foot to help 
the foot lie closer to the ground.

Stances  17
In the up stance, the upper body is loose and relaxed, and the forearms 
are relaxed on the thighs (figure 2.5). The shoulders should be over the 
knees. In all stances, linemen must understand that a relaxed muscle is a 
faster muscle. The linemen should be loose in their stance and in a relaxed 
state of play so they can perform to the best of their ability.
Figure 2.5  Up stance: (a) front view; (b) side view.

First Step and Helmet Placement
The first step and helmet placement are key. Most coaches emphasize 
getting the second step down on the ground. I also coach players to get 
their second step down as fast as possible, but I stress that if they don’t 
get their first step right, the second step makes no difference.

18  Complete Offensive Line
The lineman should now try going to a zone scheme and repeating 
the process with a stretch step right (figure 2.7a) and a stretch step left 
(figure 2.7b) to get a better feel for using the mental weight process. (The 
stretch step will be covered in more detail in chapter 4 in the discussion 
of the reach block.)
Gaining the proper helmet placement is a habit that must be formed 
through practice. An important coaching tip when linemen are learning 
helmet placement is that they should always keep their eyes on the target 
or aiming point. Whether aiming for the chin on a drive block or the V 
of the neck on a down block, linemen should always drive through the 
defender with their eyes focused on their target. Many football players 
Another term used to describe the first step and helmet placement is 
mental weight. If stepping with the right foot, the lineman needs to shift 
his mental weight to the left leg. This is not a full-body lean, just a short 
weight shift to the opposite leg. A lineman’s success is a product of his 
first step. To better understand mental weight, players can imagine that 
the right foot has all of the body weight on it; then they should try to 
pick up the right foot and move it. This cannot be done. The same is true 
when lining up on the offensive line. Proper mental weight allows the 
lineman to take proper steps. This is key when playing on the offensive 
line. Once a lineman gets a feel for body balance and mental weight shifts, 
he should begin to work on starts. He should come off the ball with the 
right-foot step on a drive block (figure 2.6a). He then repeats with a left-
foot step on a drive block (figure 2.6b).

have bad eye habits and do not use their eyes effectively on the field. 
Football players need to take advantage of this resource and use it to their 
favor. It is difficult to hit something if you are not looking at it. A player’s 
eyes will never let him down. I stress big eyes every day in practice. The 
example I like to use is Mike Singletary of the Chicago Bears. He played 
with his eyes wide open. Using the eyes makes a player much more 
aware of what is happening in his area of the field.
If an offensive lineman gains position on the block, this can make the 
difference between a long run and a very short one. A solid first step is 
the best way to gain this position. For the blocking that I teach in the 
zone blocking scheme, the first step and helmet placement are the core 
fundamentals that players must master in order to become successful.
Square Shoulders
Another valuable coaching tip in the run and pass game is that linemen 
should keep their shoulders square to the line of scrimmage. This means 
that the shoulders should run parallel to the yard lines on the football 
field. Square shoulders allow offensive linemen to stay in position for 
blocks and to pass defenders off to each other in the run and pass game. 
Square shoulders are included in run fundamentals because of their 
value in zone blocking schemes. I often tell my players that if we run 
north and south coming off the ball, and the defense goes east and west, 
we will win the game. This theory holds true with an experienced and 
disciplined offensive line.

Tight Elbows
No one wants to coach 747s with a wide wingspan. Therefore, a popular 
coaching term is tight elbows. This is a wrestling term. Tight elbows mean 
tight hands. Inside hands kick butt. Many drills can be used to develop 
tight hands. For example, in our mat program, we use small 12-inch 
hand pads that players punch as part of the warm-up (figure 2.8). I like 
these pads because they can be moved around easily. This makes for a 
drill that requires players to move very quickly and helps them develop 
quick, tight hands.
Offensive linemen must learn to use tight elbows when coming out 
of their stance for starts on any type of blocking scheme—whether it’s a 
zone, stretch, pull, or pass set.
Boxing during the summer and hitting the speed bag are also great 
drills for developing tight, quick hands. The best pads to use are hand 
shields that have the armpit for hand placement. The pads on our sled 
are from World Sporting Goods in Mobile, Alabama. These pads have 
the armpits built into the pad for hand placement purposes.

Sumo Drill
This sumo drill can be used in the off-season. Take a round hoop and 
lay it on the ground with a yard line going through the middle. Two play-
ers take their places inside the hoop with one hand on the other’s chest 
and one hand off (figure 2.9a). Both players are in a two-point stance. 
The players should keep their head out of the drill in order to avoid head 
butts. On the coach’s command of “go,” the players see who can throw 
the other out of the circle (figure 2.9b). After getting a feel for the drill, 
players take their hands off each other and go like two wrestlers, free to 
shoot their hands. This shows which player gets his hands inside first, 
while still trying to throw the other out of the hoop. Create a round-robin 
tournament and see who ends up King of the Hoops.

Hands and Leverage
Playing in the trenches of football is a game of hands and leverage. The 
low man who has inside hands will win a great percentage of the time. 
Players with great steps and helmet placement but poor hand technique 
will lose blocks and draw holding penalties. Players with great hands 
and low pad level give themselves opportunities to defeat defenders 
who may be more talented.
Leverage is a facet of the game that levels the playing field. A smaller 
player can make himself physically dominant over a larger player by 
coming off the ball with low pads and getting under the defender. Inside 
hands help him push and control the block. A player who can run with 
bent ankles, knees, and hips can play football with leverage. To measure 
a player’s natural ability to play with leverage, the coach should watch 
the player bend on lifts in the weight room, including positions during 
the squat, power clean, hang clean, and deadlift. Also, to check for ankle 
stiffness, the coach can have the player stand with his feet wide and toes 
turned out; the player then squats like a baseball catcher, and the coach 
checks to see if the player’s heels come off the ground.
Some players naturally have more leverage than others, but leverage 
can also be developed. Players can develop leverage and explosion in 
the weight room by performing Olympic lifts that focus on the lower 
body. They can also improve their leverage by using bands and exercise 
balls to perform various stretches and exercises that encourage static 
flexibility in the lower body. Every inch of leverage is worth 10 pounds.

Six-Point Explosion Drill
The six-point explosion drill can be per-
formed on the pad of a sled or with a person 
holding a hand shield. The player gets on 
his hands and knees on the ground and 
curls his toes under his feet (figure 2.10a). 
He shifts his weight back on his toes. He 
then explodes forward with his hips, keep-
ing his head up and exploding his hands 
through the pad (figure 2.10b). This is a 
full-extension movement that will leave the 
player in a fully extended position.

Chest Pass Drill
During the off-season, players should perform explosion drills to help 
develop hip explosion. Here is one effective drill that can be used: The 
player places a medicine ball on the ground with both hands on the side 
of the ball as he stands over it. He passes the ball from the ground as 
if throwing a chest pass in basketball while stepping with the right foot 
(figure 2.11a). The player then repeats the process with a throw from the 
ground while stepping with the left foot (figure 2.11b).

Summary
A proper stance, good hand position, and leverage are key for all blockers 
along the offensive line. Hands inside the framework of the body come 
from having tight elbows. Tight hands in the armpits of the defender’s 
breastplate allow the offensive lineman to control the defender in the 
run game. This hand position also leads to success for the center and 
guards much of the time in pass protection. A lineman achieves this 
hand position by keeping his eyes focused on the target and punching 
aggressively to the target.
In the next chapter, we’ll discuss the drive block, including the stance, 
approach, steps, and contact for this fundamental block. Drills for per-
fecting this block will also be presented.

Drive Blocks
The drive block is the most basic and common run block used in 
football. It is the basis of the fundamentals for all run blocks. The drive 
block is a man-on-man, one-on-one block on the line of scrimmage, but 
it could also be used on a linebacker. The principles of a successful drive 
block can be incorporated into other blocks such as reach, cutoff, trap, 
and combo blocks.
The drive block requires a player to stay square to the line of scrim-
mage. The block involves three points of contact, including the helmet 
and both hands. For a successful block, the lineman must use leverage, 
keep a flat back, and use power-producing angles while maintaining 
a base. The four steps to the drive block are approach, contact, drive, 
and finish. This chapter covers the basic fundamentals and the various 
phases of the block.
Approach
The approach for the drive block begins with the perfect stance. Refer to 
chapter 2 for the fundamentals of the stance. The player should be perfectly 
balanced in a three-point stance with slightly more pressure on the hand 
so he can explode and come off the football. For a run block, he should 
have 60 percent of his weight on his down hand and 40 percent on his legs.
Next, the player applies mental weight to delegate which foot he will 
step with first. If stepping with the right foot first, he places his mental 
weight on his left foot and vice versa. The player must be ready for the 
first step and must execute the proper helmet placement. He wants to 
explode off his lead foot, stepping out and up with a 4- to 6-inch step.

28  Complete Offensive Line
The player comes off the lead foot. The lead step (figure 3.1a) should 
go out and up very slightly. This is similar to a short post step used on 
pass protection. When I say slightly, I mean very slightly. This helps 
keep the base wide on the first step. On drive blocks, the lead foot is 
often the inside foot. By using the inside foot, the lineman helps prevent 
the defender from crossing his face and getting the shortest route to the 
football. The size of this step varies depending on the size of the player. 
Taller, bigger players may take a 6- to 8-inch step. Smaller linemen may 
take a 4- to 6-inch step. No lineman should ever take a step so big that 
he gets off balance. The width on the first step shouldn’t be more than 
2 to 3 inches over and up.
The second step (figure 3.1b) needs to get down before contact. The 
style of defensive line play will affect the point of contact. When playing 
against a reading defender, the lineman may be able to get the second 
step down before contact. Against a penetrating defender, contact may 
be made on the second step. The coach should emphasize to players 
that they need to get the second step down as quickly as possible. The 
offensive lineman should explode off the line of scrimmage with power 
and torque.
 Regardless of how fast the players come off the line, it still may not 
be fast enough for them to make certain blocks. This is especially true 
in short-yardage situations. The lead step may differ according to the 
defender’s alignment over the offensive lineman and the direction of 
the play called.
Figure 3.1  Drive block: (a) first step; (b) second step.

Drive Blocks  29
The first step should incorporate all the characteristics of a good start 
(as covered in chapter 2): The lineman needs to come off the balls of the 
feet, keep the back flat, use leverage, stay low, and power off the back foot. 
The second step should be a power step. The lineman should step about 
6 to 8 inches, landing slightly ahead of or at least even with the lead step. 
He should work hard and concentrate on getting his second step down as 
quickly as possible. This keeps momentum going forward with power and 
strength. Note that the first two steps are short steps with power and torque.
The lineman’s base will automatically narrow on the second step no 
matter what he does physically. If his first step is inside with a narrow base, 
his second step will automatically be narrower, leaving him with no base 
at all. Therefore, the lineman must keep the base wide on the first step.
Many linemen have a tendency to cross over on the second step. When 
this happens, the body gets twisted, and the lineman has no chance to 
make the block. The biggest factor in creating this problem is a really big 
first step. This in turn may lead to a wide stride and then put the player 
off balance.
Tight elbows were de­
scribed in chapter 2. When 
a player uses tight elbows, 
he will have tight hands. 
The player should think 
of “firing his guns,” which 
refers to a gun fighter’s 
motion of drawing his 
weapons from his hol-
ster. After performing this 
motion, the player should 
then make a strong punch-
ing motion toward the 
target (figure 3.2). Tight 
Coaching Point
The feet on the human body naturally tend to stay close together. 
Offensive lineman is the only position in football that requires the 
player to maintain a base with his feet apart the entire play. The feet 
are always working to get back together. This is why the lineman 
must be disciplined in his steps and lower-body movements.
Figure 3.2  Strong punching motion toward the 
target.

30  Complete Offensive Line
elbows should be a carryover from drills done in the off-season and from 
constant coaching every day.
A player who consistently flares his arms out wide during blocks 
needs to do extra work after practice to cure this habit. For example, the 
player could punch a dummy 100 to 200 times with both hands. This 
should help the player develop the ability to keep tight elbows. If 200 
times doesn’t help, the player can try 500 times until he breaks the habit 
and forms a new one.
Key Points for the Approach to the Drive Block
1.	 Execute a perfect three-point stance.
2.	 Apply mental weight to the foot opposite of the one you will step 
with first.
3.	 Prepare to execute a good first step and proper helmet placement.
4.	 Place the second step down before contact.
5.	 Use tight elbows and tight hands.
Contact
Contact is the second phase of the drive block. For the contact phase, 
the first factor to consider is the aiming point. After all, the player can’t 
hit what he can’t see.
All players need to aim at a target during every block. The aiming point 
on the drive block is the defender’s chin (figure 3.3). If the lineman puts 
the crown of his helmet to the 
defender’s chin, the lineman 
should end up at the top of 
the defender’s numbers. The 
lineman should not overthink 
the aiming point; for example, 
he doesn’t need to have his 
right eye on the defender’s 
left number. He should just 
pick a point to focus on and 
then go get it.
The targets and the eyes 
may be the most important 
parts of the block. The line-
man must use his eyes to get 
Figure 3.3  The defender’s chin is the aiming 
point for the drive block.

Drive Blocks  31
to the aiming point. For many players, their eyes are the least used parts 
of their body. A player wants big eyes on the target. When in the stance, 
he should look through his eyebrows to the aiming point. On each block, 
the lineman will use a different target on the defender. On the drive block 
versus a down defensive lineman, the offensive lineman looks through 
his eyebrows to the defender’s chin so the crown of the helmet is aimed 
through the target. Once the defender rises, the offensive lineman’s 
helmet is at the top of the defender’s numbers.
When the player gets to the fit of his block, he should make three-point 
contact (figure 3.4). On the drive block, the player needs to have three-
point contact with his helmet and both fists hitting the defender at the 
same time. The lineman’s hands should be in the defender’s armpits or 
tight on the breastplates 
of the defender’s pads. 
The lineman’s hips 
should be lower than his 
shoulders as he main-
tains a wide base. The 
toes should be slightly 
turned out on the drive. 
This will help produce 
power from the whole 
foot in the ground. The 
lineman’s hips, knees, 
and ankles produce 
the power that drives 
through the defender. 
This is where the Z cre-
ated by the knees and 
ankles (figure 3.5) helps 
produce power.
Once the lineman is 
in the fit of his block, the 
legs are very important. 
The lineman should 
push the defender as if 
he were a pickup that 
was out of gas. The 
lineman is behind the 
pickup, pushing on the 
rear bumper. He must 
keep pushing until he 
Figure 3.5  The Z angle of the hips, knees, and 
ankles produces power to drive through the defender.
Figure 3.4  Three-point contact on the drive block.

32  Complete Offensive Line
gets gas. If the legs are the power, then the head, arms, and shoulders 
are the explosion.
The core of the body is vital in transferring power from the legs through 
the body and to the explosion. This power is transferred through the 
body’s core. Therefore, offensive linemen need to do abdominal work 
daily. Flat abdomens are a must.
The offensive lineman is like a bulldozer on tracks. Once the lineman 
is into the fit and has made contact, he needs to hit through the block, 
not to the block. The lineman should avoid rolling his hips because this 
pushes his head up and slows down the movement of the bulldozer on 
tracks. The lineman must be able to run through contact. The defender 
has only one chance to stop the delivery of the blow. The defender must 
strike a blow on the offensive lineman, then shed and remove the lineman 
to make a tackle. The offensive lineman who can withstand this initial 
attempt from the defender and continue to drive through contact with 
correct technique will win the block.
The bulldozer on tracks starts with the line of departure. From point 
A to point B, the lineman must come off the ball as fast as he can. This 
includes the angle of leverage from the takeoff point, which is the stance, 
until contact in the fit. The lineman should act as if a steel rod is running 
through his back, keeping the hips behind the shoulders. This allows the 
lineman to drive like a bulldozer on tracks!
Here are some things that can cause the blocker to lose power on 
contact:
• Bending at the waist to create a hump in the back
• Coming in too high and blocking with the chest, bosom to bosom
• Coming in with the head down and collapsing to the ground
• Not using the eyes on contact, resulting in being off center of, not 
square to, the block
To learn to see through contact, players can perform this drill: A coach 
or partner takes a hand shield, holds it sideways, and hits the player’s 
face mask to see if he blinks or flinches.
Here are some other major mistakes that offensive linemen make when 
getting to the fit of their block:
• Taking a first step that is too big, causing the second step to cross 
over
• Chopping their feet in the ground, which creates no movement or 
power steps
• Coming in too high and losing leverage by rolling the hips too fast

Drive Blocks  33
Key Points for the Contact During the Drive Block
1.	 Aim at the defender’s chin.
2.	 Use your eyes.
3.	 Make three-point contact with your helmet and both hands.
4.	 Be a bulldozer on tracks.
Drive
The drive (figure 3.6) is the 
most difficult part of the block 
for most linemen to execute 
effectively. To accomplish a 
good, hard drive, the lineman 
must use a complete combina-
tion of the power from the legs 
and the explosion from the 
upper body.
The first part of the drive is 
to sustain the block after get-
ting into the fit phase. Great 
acceleration from the feet is 
a must. The lineman’s legs 
should pound the ground. He 
must hit through the defender. The lineman needs to have a hard edge. 
He must be a jet coming off the football. He needs to stay fitted into the 
block. He has to want it. He has to want to whip this defender.
The biggest fault of many players is that they do not run with their feet 
or they extend their arms. They help the defender get separation. The 
lineman needs to stay as close as possible to the defender. A defensive 
lineman’s job is to explode off the line of scrimmage, deliver his blow, 
and stop the offensive lineman. In doing so, the defender wants to use his 
hands to get separation so he can run to the football. The offensive lineman 
does not need to help the defender get separation by pushing him away.
Key Points for the Drive During the Drive Block
1.	 Produce power from the legs.
2.	 Explode with the upper body.
3.	 Hit through the defender.
4.	 Stay close to the defender.

Finish
Finishing the block (figure 3.7) is 
a matter of personal pride. I want 
my players to be noticed for the 
way they play the game. I want 
others to recognize the style of 
play. The finish comes down to 
second and third effort. How 
many pancake blocks can the 
player get in a game?
To finish off the block, the 
player needs to
• play past the whistle,
• give a second effort on 
levels 2 and 3,
• use cut blocks at the end of the block, and
• take the block off the screen.
Finishing a block comes down to attitude, grit, and a desire to keep 
constant pressure on the defender. The lineman can keep constant pres-
sure on the defender by using short, powerful steps.
Key Points for Finishing the Drive Block
1.	 Make a second or third effort.
2.	 Keep pressure on the defender.
3.	 Take pride in how you finish the block.

Drive Blocks  35
Drills for the Drive Block
To improve their ability to perform the drive block, players should first 
work on stance and starts. I like to use drill lines whenever possible so 
players are conscious about their footwork. The proper techniques for 
the stance and start were covered in chapter 2.
Next, players should work on the approach and contact through the 
fit. They should then work on the drive and the finish. Players are in 
shorts for these drills, and they work against players who are holding 
hand shields that have armpits for hand placement.
Chutes should not be used for the first couple of days until the players 
learn this block. Players should use T-boards to get the feel of getting 
the second step down and the feel of having the board between their 
legs to maintain a proper base. (A T-board is a regular 12-inch board 
with a 6- to 8-inch board at the end to form a T.) The T-board helps the 
lineman take a short first step and quickly get the second step down. 
After successfully blocking live defenders on the T-boards, the team 
can progress to chutes.
After shoulder pads are introduced, players should work on block-
ing a live defender. The defender should believe it is his job to help the 
offensive man make the best block he can make.
The end of the progression is one-on-one blocks against the defensive 
line on boards. Place a board on the ground and then tape off a distance 
of 18 to 24 inches, depending on your team’s alignments. Players put 
their hands on or behind the line (figure 3.8) and come off the ball on 
the offensive lineman’s movement. A coach should control the drill with 
a whistle.
Figure 3.8  Two players on the boards.

36
Stance and Start
Players line up behind a white line and get into a great stance. Next, 
players come out of their stances using a drive block, stepping straight 
ahead. The coach should check to see if the players are overstriding on 
the first, second, and third steps. While teaching the drive block, the coach 
should use the reverse teaching progression.
Fit
The player is fitted into a handle shield using three points of contact with 
his head up in the middle of the pad. His hand should fit ear high on the 
shield. He uses tight elbows and a slight angle in his back. His feet should 
be slightly wider than his shoulders and should be turned out slightly to 
get the most power from the inside of the foot. On the coach’s command, 
the lineman drives the shield for 5 yards. The defender provides slight 
resistance so the lineman can perform the fit and drive portion of the 
block successfully. Repeat, adding more resistance each time until the 
block is done live on the boards.

37
Approach
The offensive lineman starts with a perfect stance and then jets off the ball 
with tight elbows and head up, making three-point contact. The first step 
(figure 3.9a) should be a short step, but the player should get the second 
step (figure 3.9b) down on the ground quickly to maintain a great base.
Figure 3.9  Approach: (a) first step; (b) second step.
b
a
After mastering the approach, the lineman can let Mother Nature take 
over as he maintains a good base while driving his feet with short, pow-
erful steps down the boards. The lineman hits through the block for three 
steps, then stops to see how he is fitting into the block. The offensive 
lineman must keep his head up, look through his eyebrows, and on the 
approach, make the three-point contact portion of the block. The line-
man needs to hit through the block, so he should form a habit of hitting 
through the contact part of the block. Many players will be either too high 
early in the approach or too low with the head down. These players must 
learn to come off with a flat back and get a feel for the perfect approach 
for them as an individual.
Next, the lineman comes off the ball with a right-foot drive, then a left-
foot drive, doing two left-foot drives for each right-foot drive.

38
Contact Through the Fit
The offensive lineman stands at the end of the board in a two-point 
stance. The lineman’s knee should be bent in a good football position; the 
shoulders are over the knees, the head is up, and the arms are bent with 
hands tightly closed by the hips. On the coach’s command, the lineman 
explodes out of the stance and uses three points of contact (the helmet 
and the hands) to hit the defender face up (figure 3.10). He drives his feet 
and moves the defender down the board. The lineman needs to make sure 
he stays as low as possible when coming out of the two-point stance. He 
needs to cock his arms back as if drawing his guns out of a holster and 
then deliver a powerful blow on 
contact. The player must bow 
his neck back and keep his 
head up on contact. The line-
man must have a good bend 
in the knees so that he can roll 
his hips after contact in order 
to execute the drive portion of 
the block. The lineman blocks 
the defender for about 5 yards 
down the board. Repeat the 
block with two left-foot drives 
and one right-foot drive.
Figure 3.10  Contact through the fit, left-foot 
drive.

39
Finishing the Block
The defender stands at the end of 
the board, and the offensive line-
man gets fitted into the block. On 
the coach’s command, the lineman 
drives the defender (figure 3.11a). 
The coach will give the defender a 
direction, and on the hand signal, 
the defender will break right or left 
(figure 3.11b). The offensive line-
man has to adjust his feet, turn his 
body, and move his feet to finish off 
the defender (figure 3.11c).
Figure 3.11  Finish: (a) Lineman drives; (b) defender breaks; (c) offensive lineman 
finishes the block.
One-Man Sled
Another way to learn the drive block, including the finish, is to use a one-
man sled that will recoil on contact. Place sandbags on the base of the 
sled so the offensive lineman really has to strain to get the sled moving. 
Once the sled is moving, the lineman must be sure to maintain a wide 
base while moving his feet so that he stays square on the sled. The sled 
will soon swing, so the lineman will need to move his feet to finish.

40
Execute the Drive Block
The lineman takes a perfect three-point stance at the end of the board. The 
defender needs to be about 3 feet off the lineman. On command, the lineman 
comes out of the stance, leading with the right foot. Keeping his back flat 
and his head up, the lineman aims his helmet at the defender’s chin (figure 
3.12). This should put his helmet at the top of the defender’s numbers when 
contact is made. The offensive lineman must remember to come off the foot-
ball with a flat back! He drives his feet into the ground. Once the defender is 
moving, the toe part of the offensive lineman’s foot should be turned slightly 
to the outside (nothing drastic, just a subtle turn). This will allow the lineman 
to get all of his foot in the ground to generate more power. While keeping 
pressure on the block, the lineman gets ready to use the second and third 
effort. When he feels that the defender is ready to separate and get off the 
block, the lineman uses the finish to end the block. If the defender goes to 
the right, the lineman uses left-hand pressure and then takes the defender 
in the direction he wants to go. Once on the approach, the lineman puts 
together all the phases of the block: contact, hit through the fit (with flat back, 
head up, and tight elbows), powerful steps, and leg drive.

Drive Blocks  41
Summary
The drive block is the mother of all blocks. It is the most basic and fun-
damental block in football. All forms of blocking originate with the drive 
block. All blocks have a stance, start, approach, contact, and finish. This 
will be evident as we move from the drive block to the reach block.

Reach Blocks
The reach block is the second block that offensive linemen should 
learn in the run game. The reach block is used on the front side of a run 
play. It is also used to gain outside position on a defender. Whether the 
team is using a man blocking scheme or a zone blocking scheme, an 
offensive lineman can use a reach block on the play side.
As a coach, I prefer to use zone blocking, so the reach block is a major 
part of the run game for my teams. With the reach block, the aiming 
point on the defender is the outside breast to armpit. The reach block is 
different from the drive block, but once the blocker gets on his approach 
path, the basics of the drive block are applied. The drive block is a basic 
block that involves pushing the defender straight back off the line of 
scrimmage. On the drive block, the offensive lineman covers the whole 
defender down the middle of the block. Basically, the reach block involves 
blocking the play-side half of the defender. The approach is on an angle 
to the outside half of the defender on the play side. The reach block is a 
very useful block for smaller, quicker linemen, such as many of the line-
men in high schools or small colleges.
Approach
The offensive lineman’s stance for the reach block is the same as the 
stance used for the drive, cutoff, and down blocks. Linemen can use a 
three-point or two-point stance when executing a reach block. Tackles 
have to use both. The lineman’s mental weight process is very important 
on the reach block because the goal is to gain outside position on the 
block. The first step of the reach block is a lateral step with the outside 

44  Complete Offensive Line
foot. This step will usually cover 6 to 8 inches, but players should step 
whatever distance is necessary to avoid being off balance. This first step 
is referred to as the stretch step.
During the stretch step, the offensive lineman’s “guns” should be 
drawn to fire much like the position for the drive block. The lineman 
should focus on the target, which is the outside breast to armpit.
The offensive line should be aligned deep off the football. This allows 
the linemen to gain valuable angles on defenders (if the proper stretch 
step is taken). When taking the stretch step, the player’s head and shoul-
ders should work over the outside leg—that is, the leg that he stepped 
with (figure 4.1). Tight elbows are necessary to get the hands inside 
very quickly. The player should keep his shoulders parallel to the line 
of scrimmage as much as possible.
The second step may vary according to where the defender lines up. 
The aiming point is still the defender’s outside breast to armpit. For 
example, consider the reach block for an offensive guard or tackle facing 
a defender who is lined up in a 3 or 5 technique (figure 4.2). The lineman 
fits his block into the aiming point of the defender’s outside breast and 
armpit (figure 4.3).
Figure 4.1  During the stretch step, the head and shoulders work over the 
outside leg. The shoulders act as if they have a string attached to them: 
When the hip and leg stretch out to the right, the head and shoulders go 
with the leg on the same angle.

46  Complete Offensive Line
If the defender is in a 3, 5, or 9 technique, the offensive lineman’s 
stretch step should mirror the defender. The lineman’s toe should point 
downfield on the stretch step when he is blocking inside zone. The 
lineman’s stretch step should land even with the defender’s outside 
foot (figure 4.4a). The lineman’s second step should land even with the 
defender’s inside foot (figure 4.4b). The third step should be outside 
and upfield (figure 4.4c). The second and third steps have to be really, 
really quick. If you put it to music, it would be one–quick–two–three.

foot; (b) second step lands even with defender’s inside foot; (c) third step works

Reach Blocks  47
Contact and Fit
Just as in the drive block, three-point contact is needed for the reach 
block. The lineman’s helmet goes to the defender’s outside breast, and 
the lineman’s outside hand goes in the defender’s armpit (figure 4.5). 
The lineman’s inside hand should be on the defender’s inside number. 
The outside arm and leg must be strong on reach blocks—all pressure 
should be applied from the outside arm and leg. The inside hand is in 
push and control mode. On contact and fit, the lineman should try to 
stay as square to the line of scrimmage as possible.
Drive
Once in the fit of the block, the lineman should drive the defender on 
the angle. Linemen should not try to work for a quick hook on the line 
of scrimmage.
If the defender wants to run hard to the outside, the lineman should 
lock up and move his feet while maintaining outside pressure. If the 
defender runs hard to the outside after the lineman has started the drive 
on the defender—and the lineman believes that he is losing the block—the 
lineman should come hard with the inside hand and drive the defender 
to the outside (figure 4.6).
Coaching Point
On the angle refers to the lineman getting his hips in the direction of 
his aiming point. Basically, the lineman wants to execute a reach block 
in that direction. Once the blocker is into the fit of a reach block and 
has his hips on the right angle, he executes the basic fundamentals 
of a drive block with a great base and arm pressure. The offensive 
lineman blocks until the defender tells him where he wants to go. 
The lineman then adjusts his block accordingly.

48  Complete Offensive Line

Finish
In zone blocking, the finish on all blocks is very important. The reach 
block takes a lot of second and third efforts to make the play work. Once 
the defender is really hooked, the lineman should pin him hard and take 
him downfield. If the defender works hard outside, the lineman should 
use the reverse inside hand to take him where he wants to go. Because 
of the various directions that the defender may go, this block takes tre-
mendous effort from the offensive lineman.
Figure 4.5  During the reach block, the lineman’s helmet is at the defender’s outside 
breast, the lineman’s outside hand is in the defender’s armpit, and the lineman’s 
inside hand is on the defender’s inside number.

Reach Blocks  49
Reach Block Versus 3 and 5 Techniques
Performing the reach block on the 3 technique for the guard is the same 
as the tackle on the 5 technique. Both linemen need to focus on their 
aiming points—outside breast to armpit. They must take a great stretch 
step and explode into the block using all of the techniques previously 
mentioned. This includes keeping their elbows tight so they can punch 
while maintaining great balance. Once into the fit, the linemen must 
work the outside arm and leg strong—keeping a great base—to block 
the line of scrimmage. They should work the better player hard down 
the line of scrimmage and expand the defender. The phrase “knocking 
the defender off the line of scrimmage” is way overrated if the lineman 
can’t maintain the line of scrimmage while moving the defender laterally.
Using the Reach Block Against 3 and 5 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step is even with defender’s outside foot.
2.	 Second step is even with defender’s inside foot.
3.	 Third step gets on ground quickly; lineman runs on the angle.
4.	 Aiming point is outside breast to armpit.
5.	 Outside arm and leg are strong on contact and fit; lineman runs 
the hard angle.
Reach Block Versus 2 and 4 Techniques
In this situation, the defender is aligned much tighter on the blocker. 
A 2 or 4 technique means the defender is head up on the blocker. He is 
aligned shoe to shoe. When the offensive lineman is taking a stretch step, 
the outside foot should end up outside the defender’s foot. The primary 
aiming point is still the outside breast to armpit. Everything now becomes 
very tight. This is basically using a tight drive block with reach blocking 
techniques. In other words, the lineman takes one short stretch step and 
executes a drive block on the defender.

Using the Reach Block Against 2 and 4 Techniques

2.	 Stretch step is outside defender’s outside foot. Stretch step doesn’t

3.	 Second step is to defender’s crotch.
4.	 Quick third step is out and upfield, with quick replace.
5.	 Aiming point is outside breast to armpit.
6.	 Contact fit and drive are the same as against the 3 and 5 techniques.
7.	 Lineman is squarer to the line of scrimmage.
Tackle’s Reach Block Versus 7-Technique or 3-Gap Player
The phrase “the wider the defender, the deeper the drop” will hold true 
when blocking a defender aligned in the 7 technique. This means the 
defender is wider; therefore, the offensive lineman needs to take a drop 
step with his outside foot deeper so that his hips are more opened on 
the angle of the defender. The lineman continues to use an aiming point 
of the outside breast to armpit. This block usually doesn’t end up with 
the blocker reaching the defender because of the angle. Once contact is 
made and the defender fights outside, the lineman should use the inside 
arm and press the defender to the outside.
Using the Reach Block Against 7-Technique or 3-Gap Player
1.	 Stretch foot opens toward outside foot of 7-technique or gap player. 
Foot points out at an angle; head and shoulders are on the same 
angle.
2.	 Second step is toward inside foot of 7-technique or gap player.
3.	 Third step comes hard; the lineman runs the angle. He still uses 
one–quick–two–three.
4.	 Helmet placement works defender’s middle to outside breast.
5.	 Lineman works outside arm and leg strong.

Reach Blocks  51
Block Versus Defender on Inside Shoulder
Defenders aligned in the 1 technique and the 4I technique are reach 
blocked by the center and guard. The center must be able to reach 1 
technique all day. This should be practiced year-round. Every time the 
shotgun is snapped, the center should work on reach blocking a man 
aligned in a 1 technique. The center has to take a deep drop and aim his 
helmet to the far shoulder of the 1-technique defender. The key for this 
block is to sprint and overplay the block. The lineman then makes contact 
with his helmet and uses his outside arm to gain control. Once contact 
is made, the lineman sprints with his hips headed to the sidelines until 
he gains control; at that point, the defender is hooked.
When the guard is reach blocking a 4I-technique player on the tackle, 
he will have help from the tackle 100 percent of the time. This will make 
his reach block not as drastic as the center’s block. The guard should 
deepen his first step on the stretch and aim for the outside breast to 
armpit, then help knock the tackle off the block. Once contact is made, the 
guard should work hard for position on the block and work the outside 
arm and leg strong.
Drilling the Reach Block
I picked up a great teaching fundamental from a high school coach who 
grew tired of telling his players to move up or move back while they 
were trying to drill. To cure this problem, the coach had the center align 
over the football; the coach then marked the spot in front of the football 
where the defensive lineman could place his hand as close to the ball 
as possible. Next, the coach marked the spot where the offensive line 
should align on the center. When I do this, I mark the spot so that the 
guard’s hand will align on the center’s shoelaces. I mark this spot where 
the guard’s hand is placed. This designates the offensive line–defensive 
line relationship for all drills worked on throughout the practice.
For most college players, the distance between these placements on 
the line of scrimmage and the blockers’ down hand is 28 to 32 inches. I 
would mark the spot at 30 inches. I now have lines painted on the football 
field that are 30 inches apart for our drills.

52  Complete Offensive Line
This is the best concept I have learned in coaching. All players can 
drill with the same relationship they will use in a game. Marking these 
spots also provides these benefits:
• The guards and tackles can drill without the center.
• Defensive players can line up where needed with their hands on 
the line. The coach doesn’t have to spend the whole day moving 
players up and back.
• All drills may be performed off these lines: all reach, cutoff, and 
down blocks; all zone and gap blocking schemes; and all pass blitz 
pickups.
Stretch Step
Players should learn the stretch step from behind a line. It can be a line on 
the football field or a line on the side of a basketball court. Players should 
place their toes behind the line but as close to the line as possible. All five 
of the offensive linemen are on the line. Each player does the following:
1.	 The player thinks about shifting his mental weight so that he can 
step.
2.	 The player executes one stretch step to the right and one to the left 
(figure 4.7). He takes one step only.
Figure 4.7  Stretch step drill: (a) stretch step to the right; (b) stretch step to the left.
a
b

53
3.	 The player works on an inside zone step first.
4.	 The player executes the stretch step. He should never cross over 
his feet on inside zone.
5.	 The player works on firing his guns with tight elbows.
The players come off the ball and sprint 5 yards. They do this repeat-
edly until the coach believes they have mastered the technique. They 
then flip it over and come back with the opposite foot. I do first group, 
second group, then third group. I change the snap count with each group. 
A coach must work at this. The coach needs to be sharp and know what 
he is doing, giving each group a different count.
Stretch on Wide Zone
Next, players work on the stretch step on the outside stretch play. Each 
lineman should pretend that he has a wide player on his right shoulder 
going right.
1.	 The lineman executes a stretch step right. Emphasize putting the 
head and shoulders out over the lead step. This step needs to open 
wide, with toes pointed out toward the wide defender.
2.	 The lineman gets the second step down quickly.
3.	 The lineman maintains tight elbows. He should pump the elbows 
in a normal run motion.
4.	 The lineman runs the angle for 5 yards.
5.	 The lineman repeats the process of stretching right and then comes 
back with the left foot. Players should do this until the coach believes 
that they know what they are doing.

54
Learning Fit for the Reach Block
First, the lineman is fitted into the defender:
• Lineman’s helmet to the defender’s outside breast
• Lineman’s outside hand into the defender’s armpit
• Lineman’s inside hand on the defender’s inside number
• Lineman’s left foot at the defender’s crotch
• Lineman’s right foot outside the defender and slightly upfield
At the coach’s “go” command, the lineman makes the defender move 
to the outside and executes the best block possible. The lineman should 
work the outside arm and leg strong. The inside hand is used to guide 
with slight pressure. The lineman works to stay square to the line of scrim-
mage. He runs his angle of departure.
Step to Fit
The lineman goes back to the approach. He executes a stretch step right 
and gets his second and third steps down quickly. He practices contact 
and fit. The lineman makes three-point contact on the defender. He hits 
through the fit and stops.
Execute the Reach Block
For this drill, the linemen put all phases of the reach block together. 
They come out of their stance and block the defender using the correct 
techniques—approach, contact to fit, drive, and finish—for executing the 
reach block. The offensive linemen should do two or three of these every 
day in practice during individual period.
The right guard and right tackle go first. The center drills alone. Finally, 
the left guard and left tackle perform the drill. Linemen should practice 
the drive, reach, and cutoff blocks every day. For the first repetition of this 
drill, I have all of the linemen in a down stance. For the second repetition, 
the tackle is up in a two-point stance similar to when he is uncovered 
without a tight end.

Reach Blocks  55
The tackle uses the same techniques in a two-point stance as he does 
in a three-point stance. He should focus on staying down low, especially 
with the shoulders, when in a two-point stance. From the two-point stance, 
the tackle’s footwork is exactly the same as it is from a three-point stance.
In this drill, when the tackle is blocking out of the two-point stance, the 
defensive end should widen his alignment on the tackle. On the second 
repetition, I also have the 3-technique defender widen his alignment on 
the guard.
Summary
The reach block is a very important block in offensive line play and in 
any type of scheme, including zone blocking, man blocking, or sweep 
player on the wing. For the T blocking scheme, the reach block is a vital 
part of the team’s strategy.
There are no magic drills for teaching all these blocks. Remember, 
players should perform drive, reach, and cutoff blocks every day. When 
I think that players are not progressing at practice, or not executing well, 
I have the players do nothing but practice the drive, reach, and cutoff 
blocks for the entire individual period. This helps the players perfect the 
reach block as well as other blocks.

Cutoff Blocks
The cutoff block is the most important block used by the offen-
sive line. When well executed, the cutoff block will cut off the backside 
of the defense and create giant seams in the defense. In the zone block-
ing scheme, the point of attack on a run play can be anywhere across 
the offensive line. Long runs on the zone or stretch play are the result of 
the cutoff blocks on the backside that created these runs. When a coach 
is grading the plays, all players on the front side of a zone run should 
get a plus on the grade. The backside cutoff block is the major focus in 
the grading system. This will usually determine the success of the play.
The 18-inch cutoff block is used on the backside of the stretch play. For 
the 18-inch cutoff block, the aiming point is 18 inches inside the defender’s 
thigh. This aiming point will change according to the defender’s align-
ment. If the offense is running an inside zone play, the lineman should 
use a tight cutoff block with an aiming point of the defender’s inside 
breast to armpit. The 18-inch cutoff block is used on the outside zone play.
Approach
The lineman must use the same good stance as with the drive and reach 
blocks. He should use a three-point stance with the proper balance. If the 
tackle is uncovered, he may be in a two-point stance. The main thing is 
that the lineman must be completely balanced so he can move laterally 
to make these cutoff blocks. As with the drive and reach blocks, mental 
weight is a big factor in the execution of the cutoff block.
The footwork is based on the principle of not stepping too big and 
getting off balance. According to the defender’s alignment, the offensive 

58  Complete Offensive Line
lineman should focus on the target of 18 inches past the defender’s thigh. 
The first step is a stretch step of 6 to 8 inches (figure 5.1a). The offensive 
lineman throws his head and shoulders over the lead foot and knee. The 
second step comes down quickly on the angle (figure 5.1b). The third 
step needs to stay on the angle with power and force (figure 5.1c). The 
lineman’s arms should be drawn to fire on approach with tight elbows. 
Emphasize the inside arm working strong.

step; (c) third step.

Cutoff Blocks  59
The biggest challenge is focusing only on the aiming point 18 inches 
past the defender’s thigh. The most common mistake made by line-
men—from professional players to high school players—is looking at the 
defender. When this occurs, the lineman’s helmet will land in the middle 
or on the backside of the defender. I describe the technique to players as 
“shooting birds.” You have to lead that bird for him to fly into the shot. 
This is the same on 18-inch cutoff blocks.
The offensive lineman should use his depth of alignment off the football 
to his advantage. This will result in great angles.
Contact and Fit
If the block works out perfectly, the offensive lineman should clear his 
head past the defender. The helmet and outside arm often make first 
contact. The lineman must work hard to keep tight elbows so he can get 
his inside hand hooked up on the inside breastplate as quickly as pos-
sible (figure 5.2).
The lineman should not work for a quick hook or try to pin the defender 
too fast. He should stay on the angle as long as possible or until he has 
complete control of the block. Once control is established, the lineman 
works to finish the defender and lose him backside.
Figure 5.2  Cutoff block contact and fit; helmet placement 
with inside hand hooked up.

60  Complete Offensive Line
Three-point contact is not a big factor in the 18-inch cutoff block. Hands 
are more of a factor. Quickness off the football can play a big role in the 
cutoff block.
When I coached at Southern Illinois University, I had a split tackle, 
Chris Lockwood, who made first-team All-Missouri Valley. He was 
successful because of his ability to execute the cutoff block better than 
anyone I have ever coached. At that time, the offensive line was flip-
flopped; Chris was on the backside of many plays. He played a big role 
in the success of our running game by executing the cutoff block so well.
Drive
When in the fit of the block, the lineman should drive the defender on 
the angle (figure 5.3). Again, the lineman must not work for a quick hook 
once he makes contact. One of the biggest 
mistakes a lineman can make is trying to 
hook the defender as soon as he makes 
contact. To correct this mistake, I take a 
position at an angle and make the blocker 
work to me as I stand at the proper angle.
On a quick hook, the defender will 
fight across the block. Now the blocker 
is working backside and has lost his 
helmet placement. A lot of holding pen-
alties come when the lineman is out of 
position.
While driving the defender on the angle, the lineman should execute 
the same technique as on the reach block. He should work the inside arm 
and leg strong with the back arm in push mode.
Finish
Again, the cutoff block is the most important block to execute. Remember, 
the team whose offensive line does the best job of executing the cutoff 
block will be the team that has the most long runs. Second and third 
efforts are a must for successful cutoff blocks.
If the defender runs hard to the play side, the blocker must try to flat-
ten him down the line of scrimmage. The outside hand and arm must 
be used to drive the defender hard down inside. The lineman must stay 
hooked up, run his feet, and not let the defender come back inside.
V
Coach
Figure 5.3  The coach stands at 
the proper angle for the offensive 
lineman to release and sprint 
toward the coach. Once he is on 
this angle, the lineman will then 
make contact with the defender 
and be in the proper position to 
make the block.

Cutoff Blocks  61
18-Inch Cutoff Block Versus 3 and 5 Techniques  
(Outside Shade)
In this situation, the offensive lineman 
should aim 18 inches past the defender’s 
thigh. He should then come off to this 
area and execute the technique of the 
cutoff block. The lineman needs to work 
the inside arm and leg strong. He must 
be ready to explode the arms and hands 
when contact is about to be made. He should not work for a quick hook 
block on the defender. The lineman should run the proper angle while 
getting a good feel when he tries to pin the defender to the inside.
Using the 18-Inch Cutoff Block Against 3 and 5 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step doesn’t have to be big because the lineman already 
has great position on the defender. Step should be over and up, 
putting the helmet on course for the 18-inch aiming point.
2.	 Lineman’s outside foot is aimed at the defender’s inside foot.
3.	 Helmet placement on the cutoff block overrules all steps and foot 
position.
4.	 Lineman takes quick third step with inside hand working for posi-
tion and strength.
5.	 Aiming point is 18 inches inside defender’s thigh.
6.	 During contact and fit, lineman works inside arm and leg strong; 
lineman runs the hard angle.
18-Inch Cutoff Block Versus 2 and 4 Techniques  
(Head-Up Alignment)
When the defender is in a head-up alignment on the lineman, the shoes of 
both players will also be aligned. The 18-inch aiming point is now deeper 
to the inside because of the alignment of 
the defender. The offensive blocker needs 
to open his first step slightly deeper than 
he would against a 3- or 5-technique 
defender. Then he can execute the same 
cutoff block as he did on the 3- or 5-tech-
nique player.

62  Complete Offensive Line
Coaching Point
With the aiming point a foot and a half past the defender, the line-
man’s first contact may come with the outside shoulder. The line-
man must work his outside hand inside—to the defender’s outside 
number. He must work hard to get his inside hand on the defender’s 
breastplate and gain control as quickly as possible.
Using the 18-Inch Cutoff Block Against 2 and 4 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step goes inside and must be deeper in order to gain the 
18-inch helmet placement past the defender’s thigh.
2.	 Second step works hard to the defender’s inside foot.
3.	 Quick third step stays on the angle.
4.	 Aiming point is 18 inches past the defender’s thigh.
5.	 Defender is tighter on the lineman. The lineman will have to aim 
deeper inside.
6.	 Lineman makes contact, fits, and drives with outside pad. He must 
initially work hard to gain control of the defender with the inside arm.
18-Inch Cutoff Block Versus 1 and 4I Techniques  
(Inside Shade)
A defender in a 1 technique or 4I technique is aligned deep to the blocker’s 
inside. The lineman’s first step has to be a drop step, which results in 
giving ground to gain even more ground. The offensive lineman must 
be sure to throw the shoulders over the knee in order to get the proper 
angle to make the block. The lineman 
needs to explode and run his feet as hard 
as possible. This will allow him to stay on 
his angle while making up the space cre-
ated by the defender’s alignment (which 
gives the defender a big advantage).

Cutoff Blocks  63
Using the 18-Inch Cutoff Block Against 1 and 4I Techniques
1.	 Stretch step needs to be inside and deep off the ball. The guard 
needs to stretch and sprint through the football.
2.	 Lineman attempts to get second step to the defender’s inside foot 
in order to gain the 18-inch helmet placement.
3.	 Lineman gets third step quickly on the ground; he runs his angle.
4.	 Aiming point is still 18 inches past defender’s thigh.
5.	 Things will happen much faster with the defender in this alignment. 
The wider the man (in this case, inside), the deeper the drop.
6.	 Lineman makes contact and fit with helmet and outside shoulder 
and arm first. He works hard to get the inside arm in control as 
quickly as possible.
7.	 Lineman maintains tight elbows.
Tight Cutoff Versus 3 and 5 Techniques (Outside Shade)
Tight cutoff blocks are just like reach blocks to the outside. The tight 
cutoff is simply reversed to the inside. The defender is already blocked 
by his alignment on the offensive lineman. The offensive blocker has 
the advantage. For the tight cutoff block, 
the aiming point is the inside breast to 
armpit. Basically, against a 3- or 5-tech-
nique defender, all the lineman needs to 
do is perform a short zone step and then 
execute a drive block from his cutoff.
Using the Tight Cutoff Block Against 3 and 5 Techniques
1.	 First step is slightly in and up; lineman then executes a short zone 
step.
2.	 Second step is a quick step to defender’s crotch.
3.	 Third step is straight ahead like the step on a drive block. Lineman 
gets it down on the ground quickly.
4.	 Lineman still works outside hand in push mode; he works inside 
arm and leg strong.
5.	 Aiming point is inside breast to armpit.
6.	 Lineman needs to stay square to the line of scrimmage.

Tight Cutoff Versus 2 and 4 Techniques  
(Head-Up Alignment)
In this situation, the defender positions himself head up and totally even 
with the blocker. The offensive lineman should use a short zone step to the 
inside breast and armpit. Once contact 
is made, the lineman executes the cutoff 
block with the inside arm, hand, and 
leg really strong. He should stay square 
to the line of scrimmage and drive the 
defender off the line of scrimmage.
Using the Tight Cutoff Block Against 2 and 4 Techniques
1.	 Stretch step is to outside of defender’s inside foot. First step doesn’t 
have to be a big step.
2.	 Second step is to defender’s crotch.
3.	 Quick third step is out and upfield, with quick replace.
4.	 Aiming point is inside breast to armpit.
5.	 Defender will be aligned tighter on the offensive lineman.
6.	 Contact, fit, and drive are the same as against a 3- or 5-technique 
defender.
7.	 Lineman needs to stay much more square to the line of scrimmage.
Cutoff Block Versus 1 and 4I Techniques (Inside Shade)
Once again, the defender’s alignment is on the inside shoulder toward the 
play side when the offense is running the football. This gives the defender 
the advantage. The offensive lineman must open the first zone step at a 
much deeper angle to put himself at an advantage on the defender. Once 
contact is made to the defender’s inside 
breast to armpit, this block will usually 
go on a slight angle to the inside. The 
lineman must work hard and strong on 
his inside arm, hand, and leg.

Cutoff Blocks  65
Coaching Point
The wider the defender, the deeper the lineman’s inside foot will 
need to go back. The wider the man, the deeper the drop. With a 
cutoff block, wider relates to inside alignment.
Using the Cutoff Block Against 1 and 4I Techniques
1.	 Stretch step is open toward the defender’s inside foot.
2.	 Second step goes toward the defender’s outside foot.
3.	 Third step must come quickly and hard; the lineman runs the angle. 
Just as in a reach block, the lineman counts 1–quick–2–3.
4.	 Helmet placement is at the defender’s inside breast to armpit.
5.	 Lineman needs to work the inside arm and leg strong.
Drilling the Cutoff Block
Not many drills specifically teach the cutoff block. When drilling the 
cutoff block and teaching its purpose, coaches should use the reverse 
teaching progression. This allows the lineman to learn the fit of the block 
first so that he knows how it should feel when he does the block at full 
speed. Next, the coach should fit the blocker on the defender and then 
let the blocker execute the block from this position.

66
Reverse Teaching the Cutoff Block
In the reverse teaching progression, the player begins by fitting into the 
block and then driving the defender. Next, the blocker goes from his 
stance to the fit of the block. Finally, the player executes the cutoff block 
from the stance to the finish.
The lineman is first fitted into the defender:
• Lineman’s inside hand to defender’s armpit
• Lineman’s helmet past the defender (right shoulder block)
• Lineman’s outside hand on the defender’s outside number
• Lineman’s inside leg past the defender
• Lineman’s outside leg just inside the defender’s inside leg
At the coach’s “go” command, the defender moves inside to help the 
offensive lineman make the best block possible. The lineman works his 
inside arm and leg strong. His outside hand is in push and control mode. 
The lineman works the hard angle and stays as square to the line of 
scrimmage as possible.
Step to the Fit
1.	 The lineman goes back to the approach. He gets in a good stance, 
uses a good inside stretch step, and gets the second and third 
steps down quickly.
2.	 The lineman executes contact and fit. This should be more of an 
outside shoulder block.
3.	 The lineman hits through the fit and stops. It should be a five- or 
six-step process.
4.	 The lineman gets the inside hand in control.

Cutoff Blocks  67
Execute the Cutoff Block
Work with the lines on the ground when drilling the cutoff block. Measure 
lines based on alignments off of center (figure 5.10) so that players will 
be working the proper distance for the blocks—that is, the distance they 
will work in the game. In this drill, the players put together all the phases 
of the cutoff block:
1.	 Stance, start, approach, and lever-
age to block (low pads)
2.	 Contact to fit
3.	 Drive
4.	 Finish
First, the right guard and tackle work on cutoff blocks. Then the center 
practices reach blocks to the left. Next, the left guard and tackle do cutoff 
blocks on their side of the ball.
On the second repetition, after the first and second lines execute their 
cutoff blocks versus head-up technique, I put the tackles in a two-point 
stance. On the second repetition, the defender gets on an inside shade (a 
1 technique) for the guard or a shade on the center. The tackle performs 
a cutoff block against a defender in a 4I technique. The center executes 
a reach block against a 1-technique defender on the guards.
Summary
Remember, repetition is the mother of learning. Linemen should perform 
drive, reach, and cutoff blocks every day at practice except on the day 
before a game. Players must remember to do these blocks every day. Two 
reps a day, every day, will be more helpful than four or five reps one day 
a week. In the next chapter, we’ll address the down block, which is the 
toughest block to learn.

Down Blocks
The down block is the toughest block that an offensive lineman 
must learn. If the defender is a penetrator, the lineman must get his head 
in the V of the defender’s neck and then execute a drive block to stop 
the penetration. If the defender is a reader, the lineman must work more 
upfield to make sure the defender doesn’t come across the lineman’s face 
and play him over the top. The angle of the down block on the defender 
does not allow for a very good aiming point because of the angle or 
direction that the lineman comes from.
To counter the various styles of defensive line play, the offensive line-
man needs to learn a very quick read step (basically the stretch step). 
First, the lineman needs to read the depth of the defender off the football. 
Does the defender play close to the ball with a lot of weight forward? Or 
does he play square and off the football, as a read defender? The aiming 
point is the V of the defender’s neck—that is, the 90-degree area from 
the side of the helmet to the shoulder pad—no matter which style of 
play the defender uses. The lineman’s inside hand works to the inside 
frame of the defender’s body while working across to the far number. 
The lineman’s inside hand should be in the far armpit or breastplate if 
possible. The lineman now needs to try to get his outside hand on the 
defender’s outside arm. He needs to look at the defender as a cylinder 
while splitting the cylinder down the middle.

70  Complete Offensive Line
Approach
If the defender is tight to the line of scrimmage, the offensive lineman’s 
first step is a short stretch step with the inside foot, giving ground to 
gain the proper angle for his hips. The offensive lineman’s second step 
is inside and up toward the defender so the lineman is square on the 
block. The offensive lineman’s third step puts the lineman in the proper 
direction toward the contact point of the block. The offensive lineman’s 
arms should be tight to the body, cocked, and ready to fire on contact. 
Now the offensive lineman stays low with his pads and tries to get on 
the defender as quickly as possible. When the defender is tight to the 
line of scrimmage, the offensive lineman has to be quick and unload his 
block as fast as possible.
If the defender is aligned off the football in a square (read) position, 
the offensive lineman’s first step is a short step with his inside foot, but 
now he stays very square to the line of scrimmage with his shoulders 
square as well. The offensive lineman’s second step is more upfield as 
if he were executing a backside slip block. When the defender tries to 
cross the offensive lineman’s face, the lineman needs to place his face 
mask in the V of the defender’s neck on the third step. His arms should 
be cocked and ready to fire on contact. With the lineman using low pads, 
this should end up like a drive block only the offensive lineman’s helmet 
is on the shoulder pad next to the defender’s helmet; the lineman’s out-
side hand is in the defender’s outside armpit, and his inside hand is on 
the defender’s inside breastplate.
Contact and Fit
For the down block, the contact point is from the helmet to the V of the 
neck of the defender (figure 6.1a). The offensive lineman’s inside hand 
works hard inside to the defender’s far breastplate (figure 6.1b). The 
offensive lineman’s outside hand stays tight inside while the lineman 
tries to get it on the defender’s outside arm (figure 6.1c). The hand must 
be kept off the defender’s back to avoid holding calls.

72  Complete Offensive Line
The offensive lineman needs to imagine 
the defender as a cylinder. He must try to 
stay in the middle of the cylinder (figure 
6.2). The lineman should keep himself 
square on the block; he must not lean 
inside and get off balance, because this 
would allow the defender to beat him.
The lineman should stay square on 
the block as much as possible, working 
hard to keep his outside arm strong 
on the block. If the lineman loses the 
defender, he wants to lose him to the 
inside of the block.
Drive
The offensive lineman should get square on the block. If he catches the 
defender off balance, movement should be easier. The lineman must 
now move his feet and block the defender on the angle. If the defender 
plays tough into the lineman and is holding his ground, the lineman 
must remember that the play is going outside of him. He should keep 
pressure on the block and hold his ground.
The main concern is stopping the penetration of the defender. The key 
to doing this is getting the second and third steps down into the ground 
as quickly as possible. The lineman must continue to drive his feet after 
contact is made. He must drive through the defender and keep pressure 
on the defender at all times.
The lineman should work his outside arm strong to pin the defender 
to the inside. He must not allow the defender to spin outside.
Figure 6.2  On the down block, 
the offensive lineman stays to the 
middle of the cylinder.

Down Blocks  73
Finish
The finish is the basic drive block with a great base. The offensive line-
man should keep consistent pressure on the defender until the whistle 
blows. The lineman must keep his feet moving. He should be ready for 
the defender to try to use a rip or club technique to get out of the block. 
Now it comes down to who wants it the most.
A lot of defensive linemen are taught to spin out of the block and then 
try to come over the top of the offensive lineman. If this happens, the 
offensive lineman must use his hips and work them upfield so he can 
run with the defender.
Down Block Versus a Penetrating Defender
How fast can the block be made? The faster the penetration is attacked, 
the better the block. Against a penetrating defender (figure 6.3), the line-
man needs to get the second step down quickly. He keeps a flat back 
and drives his helmet to the V of the defender’s neck. He should keep 
his eyes on the aiming point of the V of 
the neck. The lineman brings his arms in 
a powerful punch mode. He maintains 
tight elbows when coming out of his 
stance. Once he is into the fit of the block, 
he is essentially executing a drive block.
Fit for the Down Block on a Penetrating Defender
1.	 The lineman gets into the fit position on the defender; the lineman’s 
head is in the V of the defender’s neck.
2.	 The lineman puts his inside hand on the defender’s inside 
breastplate.
3.	 The lineman puts his outside hand on the defender’s outside arm.
4.	 The lineman puts his hip on an angle to the middle of the cylinder.
5.	 The lineman executes the down block on the snap count command.
6.	 The lineman moves his feet and works outside arm pressure strong. 
He works his hips upfield.

Hit Through the Fit on a Penetrating Defender
1.	 The lineman takes a stretch step of 6 to 8 inches (read step).
2.	 The lineman gets the second step down quickly.
3.	 The lineman hits with his helmet to the V of the defender’s neck.
4.	 The lineman maintains tight elbows. He fires his guns to the 
defender’s inside breastplate and outside arm.
5.	 The lineman executes the down block and hits through the defender 
for two or three steps past contact.
6.	 The lineman stops and sits in the fit position.
Coaching Points
The lineman must stay low, stay low, stay low, and move his feet!
Execute the Down Block on a Penetrating Defender
1.	 The lineman executes all of the steps for a good down block and 
blocks the defender on the angle.
2.	 After contact, the lineman drives the defender for 4 to 6 seconds.
Down Block Versus a Read Defender
When blocking on a read defender, the lineman’s first step is the same 
except it is more parallel to the line of scrimmage. When the defender 
plays across the lineman’s face, the lineman should redirect the second 
step upfield as on a drive block. The lineman should still place his head 
to the V of the defender’s neck and work hard to get his outside arm 
strong to help block or pin the defender to the inside.
When a lineman is using a reverse blocking technique against a read 
defender, all the steps are exactly the same as for the block against a 
penetrating defender. The only difference on the fit is that the blocker 
will be squarer to the line of scrimmage. The lineman should get in the fit

position with his head in the V of the defender’s neck. He should work 
all the steps discussed in the section on the fit. He needs to work hardest 
on making the outside arm strong and working the hips upfield much 
quicker. He should hit through the fit on the read defender. The lineman 
takes a stretch step (read step) of 6 to 8 inches. The second step is upfield, 
like the step on a drive block. The lineman hits his helmet to the V of the 
defender’s neck. Maintaining tight elbows, the lineman fires his guns 
to the defender’s inside breastplate and outside arm. After contact, the 
lineman blocks the defender for 4 to 6 seconds. He works hard to pin 
the defender inside. The lineman executes the down block, working his 
outside arm and leg strong. He sits in the fit. The lineman should execute 
all the coaching points and block the defender on the angle.
Down Block Versus a Defender Off the Ball
When the defender is off the ball on a down block, the lineman should 
take his read step but slow down. The block should be different than 
when attacking a penetrating defender. The lineman should slow down 
and read the defender. This allows time to redirect and perform the block.
Drilling the Down Block
Players can learn the down block just like the reach or cutoff block, 
working off two lines. Drill the block off the lines on the field. Players 
should first practice the block with the defender penetrating the line of 
scrimmage. When preparing for a team whose defensive line uses both 
the penetrating and reading techniques, players can work on blocking 
the penetrator one day and the read technique the next day.

76
Hit Through the Fit
1.	 The lineman takes a 6- to 8-inch stretch step with his inside foot 
and opens his hips toward the defender.
2.	 The lineman gets his second step down quickly.
3.	 The lineman keeps his eyes on the target. He puts his helmet to 
the V of the defender’s neck.
4.	 The lineman stays low with tight elbows.
5.	 The lineman explodes his arms to the defender’s inside number 
and outside arm.
6.	 The lineman executes the down block on the angle.
7.	 The lineman moves his feet and works on applying pressure with 
his outside hand and arm. He works his hips upfield.
Drill with two read defenders to one penetrating defender. The center 
needs to get double reps on this block because he is the only lineman 
who has to execute this block to both sides.
Teaching the Block Using the Reverse 
Blocking Progression
1.	 Place five boards on the ground at a 
45-degree angle. Place three of the 
boards facing inside, simulating the 
center, guard, and tackle. The other 
two boards face the opposite way 
(figure 6.4).
2.	 The lineman takes the proper steps and blocks the defender down 
the boards. The center and either the right guard or right tackle will 
work together. This will allow the other guard and tackle to block 
down on their side.
3.	 The coach can place a bag holder on the board. When the player 
makes contact, he will get resistance while going down the board. 
He should work the outside arm and leg strong.
Figure 6.4  Setup for the re-
verse blocking progression.

Down Blocks  77
Reverse Body Block
The last down block that can be used is the reverse body block.
1.	 The lineman takes a wide, open step to open his hips.
2.	 The lineman throws his head and arms in front of the defender to 
stop penetration, and he gets a quick second step down.
3.	 With high hips, the lineman works his butt upfield to the outside. 
He stays on both hands and both feet.
4.	 The lineman executes a four-point crab walk. He keeps pressure 
on the defender with his hips. The lineman should feel the defender 
in his rib area when pressure is applied.
Summary
The down block is one of the toughest blocks to master. For all but wing-T 
teams, it is also one of the least used blocks. The approach, contact, fit, 
drive, and finish are each important to the success of the down block. 
Keeping the eyes on the target and using the aiming point of the V of 
the neck will aid the lineman in making the block.
The next chapter covers combination blocks. Combination blocks 
involve two linemen working together to block a defender on level 1 
while working up to the defender on level 2.

Combination 
Blocks
Combination blocks are blocking schemes in which two or 
more linemen work together on a level-1 defender before one of the 
linemen works off to a defender on level 1, 2, or 3. For example, when 
the guard and center are working play side, the term for their combina-
tion is Jack. Queen is used for the guard–tackle combination. King is the 
tackle–tight end combination. Another term—either you or read—is added 
to describe the combination used to block the defender.
Combination blocks require a lot of repetition and practice because 
of the timing it takes for two linemen to work together. Combo blocks 
involve a post man, who is the covered lineman, and a drive man, who 
is the uncovered lineman. It takes a lot of practice for players to know 
how much of the defender each lineman should cover when executing 
the block.

80  Complete Offensive Line
Center–Guard (Jack) Combination Blocks
The center–guard combo blocks in the zone blocking scheme are Jack You 
and Jack Read. These calls specify who will block the declared linebacker.
Jack You Call
On the Jack You block, the guard has to use his outside footwork with a 
short stretch step. The second step, made with the inside foot, should be in 
the middle of the level-1 defender. This places the guard on the outside half 
of the defender (figure 7.1). By this time, the center should be there to help. 
Once the center is working with the guard, the guard keeps a wide base 
and keeps driving his feet. The guard does not come off the block until the 
linebacker gets almost even with him. Once 
the guard comes off on the linebacker, the 
guard gets in the middle of the linebacker 
and executes a drive block. The guard fin-
ishes the linebacker until the whistle blows.
Jack: center–guard combination block
You: The center tells the guard, “You go get the linebacker.”
On the combo Jack block, the center should snap the football while 
taking a deeper drop step to the blocking side. This will open his hips 
on the proper angle. The center should work on driving his helmet to 
the middle of the level-1 defender and become the drive man. The center 
should use both hands and the helmet on contact and should then move 
the defender on an angle of about 45 degrees. When the center feels the 
guard come off to block the linebacker, the center should have the level-1 
defender covered and should keep blocking until the whistle blows.
Jack Read Call
For the Jack Read call (figure 7.2), the guard should use the same foot-
work and technique that he used on the Jack You call. On this block, the 
center needs to work square to the line of scrimmage while working 
the inside half of the defender. Both the guard and center have to stay 
on the defender until the linebacker declares one side or the other. The 
general rule is that a lineman should not come off onto the linebacker 
until he can read both jersey numbers on 
the linebacker. Once the lineman comes off 
to block the linebacker, the lineman should 
get into the middle of the linebacker and 
block until the whistle.

Combination Blocks  81
Jack: center–guard combination block
Read: The center tells the guard, “We combo together, and when the 
linebacker commits, one of us comes off.”
A Jack Me call may also be used, but technically it isn’t a combo block. 
For the Jack Me call, the center tells the guard that the center will go get 
the linebacker. The guard blocks the defensive lineman.
This system works the same down the line with the guard–tackle 
(Queen) and tackle–tight end (King) combination blocks.
Guard–Tackle (Queen) Combination Blocks
The combination block between the guard and the tackle works to the 
linebacker who is lined up outside the guard.
Queen You Call
For the Queen You call (figure 7.3), the tackle should be the post man using 
outside footwork, the same as the guard did to block the 1-technique 
defender on the Jack You call. The tackle takes a short stretch step with 
the outside foot. The second step is down the middle of the defender 
and upfield. This will put the tackle a “half a man” on the defender; the 
tackle’s inside half covers up the defender. The tackle should continue 
to keep a wide base and drive off the line of scrimmage until the line-
backer comes up and forces the tackle to come off the block. The tackle 
now takes the linebacker down the middle, executes a drive block, and 
finishes until the whistle blows.
The guard will be more even on this block than the center was on his 
block because of the alignments on the line of scrimmage. (The center 
is moved up in front of the rest of the offensive line.) The guard should 
take a short stretch step, open his hips 
toward the defender, and with helmet and 
hands, drive the middle of the defender on 
a 45-degree angle, taking over the block. 
The guard finishes the block until the 
whistle blows.

You: The guard tells the tackle, “You go get the linebacker.”

82  Complete Offensive Line
Queen Read Call
Queen Read (figure 7.4) is exactly like Jack Read except the guard is even 
with the tackle. This should be much easier for the guard to execute than 
it was for the center. The guard should use outside footwork to cover up 
the defender. He blocks the level-1 defender off the ball until the line-
backer shows one side or the other. The lineman does not come off on 
the linebacker until both linemen can read 
the linebacker’s jersey numbers. Whoever 
comes off (either the tackle or the guard) 
blocks the linebacker down the middle with 
a drive block and finishes until the whistle.
Queen: guard–tackle combination block
Read: The guard tells the tackle, “We will combo the linebacker 
together.”
The Queen Me call is not technically a combination block. For the 
Queen Me call, the guard tells the tackle that the guard will get the line-
backer. The tackle blocks the level-1 defender.
Tackle–Tight End (King) Combination Blocks
The tackle and tight end work together on the King You and King Read calls.
King You Call
For King You (figure 7.5), the tight end uses outside footwork just like the 
tackle and guard in the Jack and Queen You calls. The tight end covers 
the defender with his inside half. He keeps a wide base and drives the 
defender off the line of scrimmage with the tackle’s help. Once he can 
read the linebacker’s jersey numbers, the tight end is ready to come off 
the combo block and execute a drive block down the middle of the line-
backer until the whistle blows.
The tackle should take a good stretch step with depth in order to get on 
a 45-degree angle to block the defender. He should take the block over so 
the tight end can come off the combo block 
and block the linebacker. The tackle should 
use outside footwork. The aiming points are 
the same as the guard’s and tackle’s aiming 
points on Jack and Queen You blocks.
King: tackle–tight end combination block
You: The tackle tells the tight end, “You go get the linebacker.”

Combination Blocks  83
King Read Call
Most of the time, King Read (figure 7.6) is a combo block used when the 
linebacker is lined up inside the tight end. The tight end should use out-
side footwork just like the guard and tackle in the Jack and Queen combos. 
The tackle uses outside footwork as well, but he covers the defender with 
his outside half, while the tight end covers the defender with his inside 
half. Both should make contact at the same time and drive the defender 
off the line of scrimmage. If the linebacker works over the top to the 
outside, the tackle needs to take over the block as the tight end comes 
off and executes a drive block on the linebacker until the whistle blows.
The biggest mistake is when the tight end comes off too early and leaves 
the tackle stranded. The tight end must not come off until he can read 
both numbers on the linebacker’s jersey. 
The tackle should see the linebacker work 
outside, snap his head across to the middle 
of the defender, and then block him down 
the middle.
King: tackle–tight end combination block
Read: The tackle tells the tight end, “We will combo the linebacker 
together.”
The King Me call isn’t technically a combination block. For the King 
Me call, the tackle tells the tight end that the tackle will get the linebacker. 
The tight end blocks the defensive lineman.
Gap Schemes
All of these calls (Jack, Queen, and King) are used on the inside zone, 
stretch, and option plays when running. The techniques are different, but 
the called assignments stay the same. If the offense is using gap schemes, 
such as the power play or counter play, the same system of calls is in 
effect. Although different techniques and different footwork may be used 
on gap plays, the theory of the system remains the same regarding the 
play-side combinations.
Let’s look at the blocking combinations used on the gap scheme.

Jack Back
Jack Back (figure 7.7) is a double team between the center and the play-
side guard that blocks the nose guard to the backside linebacker.
The center is the post man on this block. His help comes from the right 
guard, so the center should use left footwork on his drive block. The 
center’s job is to get the nose guard up and to be right down the middle 
of him. The play-side guard is the drive man. Using his inside foot, the 
guard steps inside and up, gaining ground on his first step. Staying low, 
he reads the play-side hip of the nose guard and drives his near shoul-
der pad through the defender’s hip; the guard blocks the nose guard 
backside and then works up to the linebacker if the nose guard slants to 
the backside. If the nose guard slants to the guard, the center and guard 
combo block. If both have to stay on the nose guard and no one gets off 
on the linebacker, and if the guard has good control of the nose guard, 
the center will work up and block the linebacker.
Jack: center–guard combination block
Back: The center tells the guard to 
double off to the backside linebacker.
Coaching Point
Sometimes when the guard blocks the nose guard over really well, 
the linebacker will run over the top. In this case, the guard needs 
to snap off and block the linebacker in the direction he wants to go. 
The running back can still cut off this block.
Queen Back
The Queen Back (figure 7.8) double team is between the play-side guard 
and tackle, and it goes to the backside linebacker. In this case, the guard 
usually has a 3-technique defender lined up on him.
The guard uses inside footwork, taking a short stretch step with his 
inside foot. If the 3-technique defender pinches, this will allow a great 
block to the inside. After the short stretch step, the guard moves his 
outside foot down the middle of the defender and covers the defender 
with his outside half.

Figure 7.7  Jack Back call.

Combination Blocks  85
Coaching Point
On this block, the players should use the same technique and foot-
work used on a power step. The defender shouldn’t know if he is 
getting double-teamed or slip blocked.
Now the guard posts the 3-technique defender for the tackle to drive off 
the line of scrimmage. The only time the guard should come off on the line-
backer is if the linebacker fires into the A gap and comes through the inside 
of the guard. If the guard and tackle block the defender so far off the line, 
the guard should be the one to come off on the linebacker. The tackle should 
take a short stretch step with his inside foot and try to stay as square as pos-
sible to the line of scrimmage while blocking the outside hip of the defender.
The linemen want to displace the 3-technique defender first, then worry 
about the linebacker. Once contact is made, the guard’s outside hip and the 
tackle’s inside hip should work together. The 
linemen should stay square and generate the 
most power possible. If the guard and tackle 
are both used on the 3-technique player and 
do not block the linebacker, this is okay.
Queen: guard–tackle combination block
Back: The guard tells the tackle to double off to the backside 
linebacker.
King Back
For the King Back (figure 7.9), the tackle and tight end double the 5-technique 
tackle back to the backside linebacker. The tackle should use the same coach-
ing points just discussed for the guard on the Queen Back, and the tight end 
should do the same as the tackle. Footwork, technique, and aiming points 
are all the same. The major difference in the King Back scheme is that the 
tackle is usually the main blocker who comes off on the backside linebacker 
once the tight end makes contact. The tight end needs to get his helmet to 
the middle of the 5-technique player and 
take over the block. The tight end uses inside 
footwork, drives his helmet and hands to 
the middle of the defender, and drives the 
defender on the angle, usually on the inside.
King: tackle–tight end combination block
Back: The tackle tells the tight end to double off to the backside 
linebacker.

Jack Mike
The Jack Mike block (figure 7.10) may end up in a double team. It could 
also end up with the center single blocking the nose guard and the guard 
staying square while working up to the Mike linebacker.
Coaching Point
The guard should learn that the A gap between him and the center 
is a canal. The guard needs to take a T-board step to the inside, stay 
square, and go down the canal to the Mike linebacker.
If the Mike linebacker runs over, the guard should turn and block the 
Mike to the outside.
Jack: center–guard combination block
Mike: The center tells the guard to 
double to the Mike linebacker.
Queen Mike
For the Queen Mike (figure 7.11), the guard uses the same technique he 
used on the power slip with inside footwork. When double-teaming to 
the Mike linebacker, the guard should take more of the down lineman; 
the tackle can knock the defensive lineman over to the guard, allowing 
the tackle to get up on the linebacker.
If the Mike linebacker runs under the 
guard into the A gap, then the guard 
comes off on the linebacker, and the tackle 
stays on the defensive lineman. The guard 
and tackle must keep four eyes on the 
linebacker.
Queen: guard–tackle combination block
Mike: The guard tells the tackle to double off to the Mike linebacker.
King Mike
For the King Mike (figure 7.12), the tackle comes off the double team 
only if the Mike linebacker comes through the B gap. The tackle uses 
inside footwork and his power slip techniques. The tackle needs to take 
as much of the defensive lineman as possible. The tight end should knock 
the defensive tackle to the tackle and work up for the middle linebacker.

Learning Combination Blocks
Offensive linemen can learn the various combination blocks by starting 
with the inside zone play versus a 1-technique defender.
Inside Zone Center–Guard Combinations: 1 and 2 Techniques
The offensive linemen should start learning this blocking combination 
by working against just a defensive lineman and no linebacker (figure 
7.13). The linemen need to understand how 
important it is to take care of level 1.
More often than not, players want to go to 
level 2 too fast. This results in short yardage 
or loss of yardage. If the offense takes care 
of level 1, they will always gain yardage.
The guards are really deep off the foot-
ball. For the timing of this combination 
block to be effective, the guard must come 
off the football hard. The guard’s footwork is outside foot over and up as on 
the step for a drive block. He should get the second step down as quickly 
as possible and be ready to make contact with the inside foot and inside 
shoulder. The guard may use his forearms or his hands to deliver the blow.
Coaching Point
The phrase “same foot, same shoulder” applies to these combination 
blocks. A lineman never wants to hit one shoulder and opposite foot 
on any block. He should always hit same foot, same shoulder. This 
delivers power and thrust through the defender.
The center should snap the football and take a stretch step to get started 
on his proper angle. The wider the defender, the deeper the drop. The 
center may use a forearm flipper or his hands on contact. I prefer that 
players use the hands. The offensive lineman should feel the defender 
and try to gain some control by using his hands. Sometimes using the

forearm provides very little control. The center’s aiming point is the 
defender’s near number.
When the guard is covered, it is his job to get leverage and post the 
defender. The uncovered man’s job is to get movement and push the 
defender back to level 2. After a few days of working on blocking the 
level-1 defender, add the linebacker into the drill.
On the double team, a big problem occurs when one of the blockers 
comes off too early to block the linebacker. I coach four hands on the 
defender, four eyes on the linebacker. When the blocker can read both 
of the linebacker’s numbers, that means 
the linebacker is committed to the play 
side, so the blocker needs to come off the 
down block (figure 7.14). I have one stan-
dard rule: If there is any doubt, the blocker 
should not come off and should stay on the 
level-1 double team.
The principles for all covered linemen 
are the same:
• Bring the outside foot over and up (short stretch).
• Use the inside foot and inside shoulder.
• Get the step down quickly.
• Maintain your base.
• Aim at the defender’s outside breast.
• Drive the defender with two hands on the defender and two eyes 
on the linebacker.
• If the linebacker commits outside, take him; if not, stay on the 
down lineman.
Uncovered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step with the play-side foot.
• Get the second step down quickly.
• Never cross over the feet.
• Keep your base.
• Take the third step when contact is made with the play-side foot 
and play-side shoulder.
• Aim at the defender’s inside breast.
• If the linebacker goes outside, work your head across and take 
over the down lineman.

mitted to the play side. When 
the blocker can read both num-
bers on the linebacker’s jersey, 
it’s time to come off and block 
the linebacker.

Combination Blocks  89
The uncovered man’s steps should be one, quick, two, three with 
contact on the third step. A 1 and 2 technique are treated the same. With 
a 2, 4, or 6 head-up technique, the lineman should expect movement. In 
these situations, we call “Jack, Queen, King, You.” If the head-up defender 
steps out, it goes to “Jack, Queen, King, Me.”
Once the offensive lineman comes off to the linebacker, each of these 
situations may be different depending on how the linebacker decides to 
play. If the linebacker attacks the line of scrimmage, the lineman should 
try to get his head across to the defender’s far number—or at least to 
his near number—and execute a drive block. The lineman should move 
his feet and try to move the defender wherever he can. If the linebacker 
sits, the lineman should come off and hit him square down the middle, 
then perform the perfect drive block.
Inside Zone Versus 3, 5, and 9 Techniques
When an offensive lineman has the outside shades, success comes down 
to base blocking unless the lineman gets movement when the defender 
slants or angles inside.
All covered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step.
• Execute a tight reach block.
• Aim at the defender’s outside breast to armpit.
• Block on the angle.
Uncovered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step (inside zone) and never cross over your feet.
• Block the linebacker from outside breast to armpit, moving the 
linebacker down the middle.
• Always expect a spike by the defender aligned in a 3, 5, or 9 
technique.
Backside Combination Blocks, Inside Zone
Backside blocking combinations are based on the same principles as the 
front side. On the backside, a buzzword is used for the center and back-
side guard working together. Buzzwords are also used for the backside 
guard and tackle and the backside tackle and tight end.
For example, the buzzword Scoop may be used for the center and 
backside guard; that is a very standard call. Slip could refer to the guard 
and tackle, and Slide to the tackle and tight end.

90  Complete Offensive Line
For a zone blocking run scheme, the center and backside guard combo 
block the defender to the backside linebacker (figure 7.15). The center 
uses play-side footwork and gets his backside half on the nose guard 
to lift him from the backside guard. The backside guard takes a zone 
step to the play side; he blocks the defender with his helmet to the far 
number using the right-arm strong technique and then takes over the 
defender. This is the Scoop Back blocking scheme to get the nose guard 
and backside linebacker blocked.
The center should zone up to block the backside linebacker with his

his helmet will go backside on the block every time! The center leads 
the linebacker a couple yards and then blocks him. He stays square to 
the line of scrimmage.

On the power slip block between the backside guard and tackle (figure

side half of his body. The backside tackle uses a stretch step and aims for 
the far numbers of the defender with a strong-arm technique (play-side 
arm); he then takes over the defender. The guard should work up and 
block the backside linebacker on his play-side number.

The Slip You call (figure 7.18) tells the tackle to zone up and block the 
backside linebacker on his play-side number. The guard uses an 18-inch 
cutoff technique on the 1-technique defender. The Slip You is a block in 
which the backside tackle and tight end combo off the defensive lineman 
up to the backside linebacker. The tackle uses inside footwork and, as 
with the center and guard, lifts the defender for the tight end with the 
outside half of his body. The tight end steps inside with a zone step and 
works for the far number of the defender, using a strong inside arm to 
overtake the defender.

tion block

Blocking With an Outside Head-Up Technique
For the inside zone play, the covered lineman will use more of a power 
combination block with the uncovered lineman. This means they block 
more of the defender, trying to get at least one-half to three-quarters of 
the defender covered up on the post.

92  Complete Offensive Line
The covered lineman uses these techniques:
• Take a stretch step with the play-side foot.
• Do not cross over your feet.
• Make contact with the outside shoulder and leg (same foot, same 
shoulder).
• Block the inside half of the defender.
• Get leverage and stay square.
• Keep two eyes on the linebacker.
• Do not let your inside (play-side) hand get involved in the block.
• Stay on the down lineman until the linebacker takes you off the 
block and you can read both of the linebacker’s numbers.
The uncovered lineman uses these techniques:
• Take a stretch step with the play-side foot; give a little ground to 
get a good angle on the defender.
• Aim your second step at a point behind the defender’s outside foot.
• Work to take the defender over at the aiming point of his inside 
breast.
• Stay low and work for inside hand leverage.
• Work your angle to the line of scrimmage and stay as square as 
possible.
Coaching Point
Any time the guard is covered and the backside tackle is uncovered, 
no matter the technique of the defenders, the backside tackle works 
with the guard to block the defender up to the linebacker. This goes 
back to covered, uncovered principles of who each lineman works 
with in zone blocking.
Blocking With an Inside Technique  
Away From an Uncovered Lineman
In this situation, we still have zone blocking principles in place, taking 
the zone steps to the play side. When the techniques are away, like on an 
inside shade, the offensive linemen basically end up with man blocking. 

Combination Blocks  93
The guard blocks man to man on the 1-technique defender, using an 
18-inch cutoff block. The backside tackle uses a zone step and then goes 
up to block man to man on the linebacker.
The covered linemen follow these principles:
• Execute a cutoff block to the play side.
• Work to get square to the line of scrimmage.
The uncovered linemen follow these principles:
• Take a stretch step (inside zone) and never cross over your feet.
• Block the linebacker’s inside breast to armpit; if the linebacker is 
moving, block him and then adjust and block down the middle or 
backside number.
• Always expect a spike by the inside-shaded defender.
Summary
This chapter covered all of the calls play side and backside on zone and 
gap blocking combinations. For combo blocks, a lineman must know 
who he works with and the techniques required. For successful zone 
blocking, players must know the post man and drive man on double 
teams, as well as who is covered and uncovered. This information will 
be beneficial in understanding chapter 8, which covers the stretch play 
and outside zone blocking scheme.

Stretch Plays
The stretch plays covered in this chapter will explain all the dif-
ferent defensive fronts you will be asked to block. We will explain the 
1-2 reads on each front that you block, that the running back should be 
reading as he runs the football. All blocks, such as the read, cutoff, and 
slips, will be covered in length.
Stretch Plays to the Tight-End Side
The stretch play using an outside zone blocking scheme is my number 
one running play, and this blocking scheme may also be used on numer-
ous other running plays. The option play can be run to the tight-end side 
and split side. Both use stretch zone blocking. The only difference is that 
the offense does not block the end man on the line of scrimmage. The 
option game will be covered in chapter 10. The speed sweep, toss sweep, 
and base stretch play use the outside zone scheme.
The guards should maintain base splits at a foot and a half. The tack-
les and tight ends should use a tight two-foot split so the inside blocker 
does not get hung out to dry. The tackles and tight ends must learn not 
to oversplit; if they oversplit and a three-man game call is made, the 
lineman in the middle is really in trouble.
Obviously, the goal of the stretch play is to get the football to the out-
side of the defense. The more the defense is stretched, the more seams 
will likely be created. The goal is to get the front side of the defense 
moving hard laterally while the backside offensive linemen make great 
cutoff blocks on the backside. This will separate the defense, opening 
the desired seams.

96  Complete Offensive Line
Coaching Point
For the stretch play, the running backs and linemen must be on the 
same page. The running backs coach and offensive line coach have 
to speak the same language. Sometimes egos get involved, so I 
prefer to have the offensive line coach put in the play and coach all 
positions on the running of the play. This way, the running backs, tight 
ends, wide receivers, and offensive line are totally on the same page.
In this section, we look at stretch plays to the tight-end side versus 
four defensive fronts. The play is shown with all 11 players; we discuss 
the assignments for the running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends. 
Then we concentrate on the offensive line. Figure 8.1 shows the stretch 
play to the tight-end side against an odd defense.

Stretch Plays  97
The tailback is 7 yards deep in a two-point stance. (If the running back 
is very quick, he could move to 8 yards deep.) His aiming point is the 
butt of the play-side tight end or imaginary tight end. He must stay on 
track. The quarterback’s job is to get the football to the tailback. The full-
back can be used as a backside cut blocker or a front-side force blocker, 
depending on the call and the defensive front.
The wide receivers must take a maximum split. If the ball is in the 
middle of the field, both receivers will split to the top of the numbers 
(college). They block force defenders. If they have any doubt, they block 
the safeties.
Offensive Line Blocking Versus Odd Fronts and Variations
The play-side tackle and tight end 
must get the outside linebacker 
and the number 1 read moving as 
quickly as possible (figure 8.2). The 
faster the number 1 read moves, 
the quicker the running back gets 
his first read. Now his eye can 
go back to his second read. If the 
number 1 read works outside and 
the number 2 read gets reached, the 
ball should go in the B gap.
These are the assignments that 
the offensive line must execute on 
the stretch play to the tight-end side:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch run, track to linebacker
Center: stretch block play-side A gap (scoop back)
Backside guard: stretch backside AW gap (scoop back)
Backside tackle: cutoff block
The tackle and tight end execute reach blocks. They get the first read 
and run hard, working the outside arm and leg strong. The guard always 
expects a pinch from the 5- or 4-technique defender. On stretch plays, 
the center stretches and rips and works to the front-side linebacker to get 
the backside linebacker. The backside guard pulls and overtakes, while 
the backside tackle uses a great 18-inch cutoff block with the inside arm 
strong. The cutoff block is the key to the success of the play.

Figure 8.2  Outside stretch play when

2 read gets reached. The most important 
block of all five linemen is the cutoff block 
on the backside, which is executed by the 
backside tackle in this case.

98  Complete Offensive Line
If the number 1 read pinches to the 
inside (figure 8.3), the running back auto-
matically takes the football into the C gap. 
The running back makes one cut and puts 
the football north and south. The offensive 
linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block; squeeze off pinch 
block to linebacker’s outside number
Guard: stretch to overtake (pinch 5 
technique), head across
Center: stretch play-side A gap slip off 
slant nose guard to backside linebacker
Backside guard: stretch and overtake nose guard, head across (cut 
block)
Backside tackle: 18-inch cutoff block
The play-side tackle should try not to overreach the defensive tackle 
because this puts a lot of pressure on the uncovered guard to overtake 
the pinch defender. The tackle should work through the outside breast 
to armpit and squeeze off the defender on his way to the linebacker. He 
should try to stay as square as possible. The backside guard should be 
ready to get his head across the nose guard and cut block his far leg. 
If the center comes off clean and thinks he has position, he executes a 
cut block on the backside linebacker. (The center should not look at the 
linebacker; he should lead him.)
Coaching Point
A big kid who has trouble cut blocking should stay high and cover 
up the linebacker. A coach shouldn’t ask a player to do something 
that his body won’t let him do.

Figure 8.3  When the uncov-

Stretch Plays  99
When the number 1 read runs 
hard to the outside (figure 8.4), the 
center is hooked up, and the number 
2 read is coming hard to the outside, 
the running back should cut off the 
backside of the number 2 read. Theo-
retically, this will put the football in 
the backside weak A gap. When the 
defense flows hard, this cut will still 
happen out around the play-side 
tackle and tight-end area.
Coaching Point
On the front side, linemen must be sure to maintain helmet place-
ment and stay on their feet. The backside cutoff block by the back-
side tackle is the most important block. The coach has to sell this 
to his players. I tell our players that all five offensive linemen are at 
the point of attack.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch run at an angle to the linebacker
Center: scoop back to lock up nose guard; maintain helmet place-
ment
Backside guard: scoop, run track to linebacker
Backside tackle: cutoff block
Fast-flow linebackers can be a problem for the center, guard, tackle, or 
tight end, especially if the offensive player doesn’t abandon his partner 
on the squeeze-off. When the lineman comes off and the linebacker is 
running hard to the outside, the lineman should lock onto the linebacker’s 
backside number and drive him to the sidelines.

100  Complete Offensive Line
When the outside linebacker in an odd 
front lines up in a head-up position toe to 
toe with the tight end, he now becomes 
the number 1 read (figure 8.5). When this 
occurs, we make a three-man game call that 
tells the guard, tackle, and tight end that we 
are taking the zone out to the tight end at this point. As long as the tight 
end is facing a 9 technique or outside technique, he is by himself, and the 
zone stops at the tackle. When the linebacker goes to a 6 or 7 technique, 
he becomes the number 1 read.
Stretch Play Versus Under Defensive Front
We try to keep this play simple even though the Mike linebacker is strong 
side and it is a member of the stack family. We treat the front side of this 
play as an odd front and block it accordingly (figure 8.6). The number 1 
and number 2 reads remain the same, and the running back treats the 
play that way.

Figure 8.5  6 call.
Against the under front, the offense should expect faster flow to the 
tight-end side because the defense is already shifted in that direction. 
Backside is where some adjustments need to be made. The backside 
guard needs to read the placement of the Will linebacker and adjust his 
path accordingly. He should make a 
call to the tackle if the linebacker is 
inside heavy into the AW gap. This call 
tells the tackle, “I’m out of here, and 
you have no help, so take the defen-
sive tackle by yourself.” At this time, 
the tackle needs to pull and overtake 
(figure 8.7).

The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: reach block
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch run track to linebacker
Center: reach block
Backside guard: slip or make call to be free and go get linebacker
Backside tackle: slip or pull and overtake
When the offense faces an under G look 
(figure 8.8), everything is the same for 
everyone except the play-side guard and 
center. A call of Jack You is still used, but 
because this is the outside zone scheme, the 
guard will use a ricochet technique to get to 
the linebacker.
On a ricochet call, the center must know 
that he needs to take the 1- or 2-technique 
defender as if he has no help. The guard 
will stretch step and tag the 1-technique 
defender with his inside hand. He must 
then shuffle skate down the line of scrim-
mage, getting no depth and staying square 
until he gets outside helmet placement on 
the linebacker (figure 8.9). This technique 
takes a lot of practice, but once the player 
can do it—and the center gets the 1- or 
2-technique player cut off—the opponent 
has no defense.
Stretch Play Versus 4-3 Stack 
Defense
If the number 1 read works outside and 
the number 2 read gets reached, the ball 
goes into the B gap (figure 8.10). This play 
involves nothing more than reach and 
cutoff blocks with the uncovered lineman 
stretching and running good tracks to the 
linebacker.

Now if the number 1 read goes inside, 
the football goes outside to the D gap. All 
of the uncovered linemen should expect a 
pinch from the covered man they are work-
ing toward. The number 1 read goes inside, 
and the ball goes outside (figure 8.11).
If the number 1 read works hard out-
side and the number 2 read runs hard to 
the outside, the running back cuts back 
behind the number 2 read in the A gap 
(figure 8.12). This should also happen in 
the tackle–tight end area on the line of 
scrimmage.
The offensive linemen execute their 
assignments:
Tight end: reach block, squeeze climb 
for Sam linebacker
Tackle: stretch run track to linebacker; 
expect pinch from number 1 read
Guard: reach block, pinch climb for 
Mike linebacker
Center: stretch run track to Mike linebacker; expect pinch from 
number 2 read
Backside guard: 18-inch cutoff block
Backside tackle: slip with guard, run track to Will linebacker, expect 
1-technique defender to loop outside
Against a shaded nose guard, the center has to give a “go” call to the 
backside guard so the guard can pull and overtake the shaded nose guard 
(figure 8.13a). The play-side tackle and tight end execute a King You call 
to the Sam linebacker. If the Sam linebacker flows (figure 8.13b), the fast-
flow linebacker technique should be put into effect. The tight end runs 
the linebacker to the sideline.

Stretch Play Versus Even-Front Defense
When the defense shows an eight-man front (figure 8.14), the offense 
needs to know if they are blocking it with a force blocker or with the 
tight end handling the number 4 player. If boss blocking the number 
4 defender, then the tight end and tackle will work a King call on the 
box players. The offense should focus more on getting the ball outside, 
especially if the defensive end is in a 6 or 7 technique.

Another technique is to have the 
tackle and tight end fan block to the 
strong safety and let the fullback go 
inside the number 1 read to get the 
linebacker (figure 8.15). On this call, the 
tailback should know that the number 
1 read is being taken to the outside so 
the ball goes to the B gap. If the number 
2 read runs hard, the ball will go back 
to the play-side A gap.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: combo block with tackle (King call) to the strong safety 
(number 4 read)
Tackle: stretch and combo block (King call) the 6- or 7-technique defender
Guard: reach block
Center: if two backs in the backfield, stretch the A gap strong for the 
play-side linebacker to the backside linebacker; if one back in the 
backfield, get the front-side linebacker
Backside guard: 18-inch cutoff block
Backside tackle: guard covered slip with backside guard and run 
track to the backside linebacker
With a six-man box and the tight end staying in the box to block, 
the backside tackle can lock the backside on the defensive end (figure 
8.16). The backside tackle still needs to stop the linebacker from running 
through the backside B gap.
The main problem against an eight-man front defense is the pinch of 
the 6- or 7-technique defender to the B gap when the offense has one 
back in the backfield (figure 8.17). This defensive pinch forces the use of

a three-man game to the play side. We work on this blitz every day in 
practice. This is the first defensive tactic I study on Sunday night when 
scouting an upcoming opponent. I study all of these pinches, one after 
another, to try to find a tip-off or giveaway.
The key is that the play-side tackle doesn’t hang out the guard by 
overreaching. The tackle needs to stretch and stay square to the line of 
scrimmage as much as possible. A natural running lane will open up if 
the offense picks up the play-side linebacker. We’ve had some really long 
runs off this pinch when it’s been blocked properly.
Stretch Plays to the Split-End Side
The stretch play to the split-end side has some very different looks that 
must be handled differently. With the new trend of spread offenses and 
the pro influence of the one-back set, the split-side running game has 
really evolved. The split-side game is very simple; if there are three 
defenders and three blockers, this will enable the offense to use the run. 
The phrase “angle, numbers, grass” is used to judge where to run the 
football. The offense will use the same “number 1 to number 2 read” 
philosophy in the running game but from a lot of different sets in the 
backfield.
Here is a simple example of how running 
backs learn this philosophy. In figure 8.18, the 
one-back stretch play is being run to the ghost 
tight ends but with the junction point of the 
handoff shown from under center. The quar-
terback and running back (dotted in) are out 
of the spread set. Based on the philosophy of 
the spread, the running back needs to know 
what the number 1 read is doing by the time 
he takes the football from the quarterback. The 
running back needs to press the junction point 
of the underneath handoff before he makes his 
one cut off the read of the number 2 defender.

point out of the I-formation.

106  Complete Offensive Line
A common error that a running back makes in the shotgun is want-
ing to bend to the line of scrimmage as soon as he touches the football 
when coming across. This creates a number of 
problems for him and the offensive line that 
cannot be fixed.
The base alignments and splits on the line 
of scrimmage stay the same: 18 inches for the 
guards and tight 2-foot splits for the tackles. 
The running backs align with their toes 5 
yards deep and shoe to shoe with the offensive 
tackle. The quarterback lines up with his toes 
on the heels of the running back (figure 8.19).
Coaching Point
Do not assign the quarterback a depth for his feet. The quarterback 
has enough to do with getting everyone lined up. The running backs 
are responsible for setting the backfield and getting the alignment 
right. If the running back messes up and sets his depth at 5 1/2 yards 
deep, the quarterback still needs to align his toes behind the heels 
of the running back.
This alignment allows the running back to come straight across; he 
will not have to veer or get off course to get to his junction point. The 
running back should be able to go from the left halfback spot to the right 
halfback spot without any problem. If the quarterback aligns toe to toe 
with the running back, the running back will get pushed into the line of 
scrimmage, and all of the running back’s cuts will be difficult.
If aligned in the pistol formation, the running back’s depth is 7 1/2 
to 8 yards. The quarterback aligns his toes at 4 yards deep. The running 
back’s angle and aiming point 
are the same as those out of the 
I-formation.
Now let’s look at how to block 
these split-side plays versus the 
four fronts as previously dis-
cussed for the tight-end side. The 
backfield set has no correlation 
with the blocking performed up 
front (figure 8.20).

Stretch Plays  107
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: stretch step, run track to linebacker
Center: scoop to backside linebacker
Backside guard: scoop for nose guard to backside linebacker
Backside tackle: slide call to tight end versus 5 technique, work up 
to strong safety
Tight end: slide call, work with tackle
To run the stretch play, the offense must be aware of the numbers they 
have to the split-end side. Against the odd front, a fullback or halfback 
must block the outside linebacker.
If the offense is in a one-back set versus this front, the play would have 
to be checked off and then go to the tight-end side. A wide receiver could 
be motioned across to block the outside linebacker, but the best strategy 
is to just check the play and go to the tight-end side.
All the blocking rules for the offensive line are the same for the split 
side.
If the fullback is offset, he will handle 
his blocking path just like he would in the 
shotgun. The fullback needs to take a 6-inch 
stretch step to the outside and then attack the 
defender as his aiming point (figure 8.21). 
The fullback should try to block him on his 
side of the line of scrimmage. He should use 
a cut block as a last resort.
Coaching Point
One spring we noticed that, especially out of the pistol set, the 
running back’s path to the split side was tighter. The running backs 
weren’t going to the ghost tight-end spot. After studying this, we 
determined that the majority of the time the defensive end would 
play hard outside. With this being the case, we started using the 
defender as the aiming point. This strategy makes that inside cut 
happen quicker and easier. Besides, if the defender pinches, it’s 
easier for the running back to get outside than to get back inside.

Blocking the Stretch Play to the Split-End Side  
Versus the Under Front
Versus the under front, the stretch play to the 
split side is very different from the stretch 
play to the tight-end side. Even when the 
numbers are right with three on three, the 
offense must still be able to get the center to 
the play-side linebacker. The “go” call (figure 
8.23) comes into effect for the backside guard 
to take the nose guard while the center is 
working to the play-side linebacker.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: reach block, call from center to say “we are working 
together”
Center: call for guards to help work to the front-side linebacker
Backside guard: call from center to take the nose guard
Backside tackle: cutoff block or slide call
Tight end: cutoff block or slide call
Treat the split side of the under front like a 40 defense. The center 
should work to the front-side linebacker. The center must know if he has 
a fullback or not for the purpose of Mike declaration.
I have avoided the Mike declaration because in a fast-paced, no-huddle 
offense, there is not enough time to make a Mike call before blocking 
the front. On some teams, the quarterback calls the Mike, and on other 
teams the center calls out the Mike linebacker. The Mike declaration is a 
situation that each team needs to work to its best benefit.

In figure 8.22, note how the I-formation 
stretch play and the shotgun split-back play 
are coordinated. Half of the time, the offen-
sive line does not know if the backfield set is 
the I or split-back formation.

Stretch Plays  109
Coaching Point
On the 40 look, the center and guard handle all of the A- and B-gap 
stunts. The fullback never goes into the A gap to get a defender. 
Instead, he reads his way to the B, C, or D gap to get to the linebacker.
The center needs to make a call to the 
guards, letting them know that he is work-
ing with the front-side guard (figure 8.24). 
The center treats the front like an even or 40 
defense.
Previously, we would scoop the front back, 
but this strategy left the front-side (A) gap 
open for the linebacker to run through. Now 
we make a call to put the center on the play 
side with the guard. The backside tackle and 
tight end must be brought along to handle 
the defensive tackle and linebacker. Figure 
8.25 is a scheme used on the weak-side lead 
play, a form of zone blocking.
For some defenses, a big blitz off the boundary side is the weak corner 
fire. To predict this stunt, the offensive team must rely heavily on film 
study. This scheme needs to be worked every day during fundamentals. 
Once the backside guard is involved, it becomes a four-man game. The 
wide receiver and fullback should swap assignments if the weak corner 
beats the wide receiver inside (figure 8.26). In a one-back set, the quar-
terback should check out of the play. The speed option is a great play to 
check into and run because the line blocking is exactly the same, letting 
the quarterback pitch off the weak corner.

One of the toughest things to do is run the play when the wide receiver 
is in no position to make his block (figure 8.27). The tackle moves out to 
the weak safety on the line of scrimmage and lets the receiver go hard 
down inside to get the linebacker. This is about the only way to handle 
this without getting the running back killed.

Figure 8.28  Changing the play to a quar-
terback run; the running back is now the 
lead blocker on defender number 4.
Figure 8.28 shows an example of the stretch play being called to the 
right side of the offense. The extra defender forced the play to be checked 
to the other side. The quarterback can check the play to the other side 
and run the stretch play himself. Now the running back, who originally 
had the call of ballcarrier, is the lead blocker.
The offensive line must complete these assignments:
Tackle: read block
Guard: zone B gap to linebacker
Center: reach nose guard
Backside guard: slip to linebacker
Backside tackle: pull over to tackle the 3-technique defender
Tight end: cutoff man on (if a tight end is used)

Stretch Plays  111
Stretch Play Versus 4-3 Stack Defense
The stretch play versus the 4-3 defense to the 
split-end side (figure 8.29) can be run with 
two different blocking schemes. First, the 
center and play-side guard can combo the 
nose guard to the middle linebacker. Second, 
the center and guard can block the nose 
guard to the Will linebacker, and the fullback 
will take the Mike linebacker. (The play-side 
guard uses an “ass pat” to tell the fullback 
that the guard will take the Will and that the 
fullback should take the Mike. Basically, they 
are changing assignments.)
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: Jack Will call, ass-pat signal to the fullback
Center: Jack Will call, nose guard to Will
Backside guard: slip call to Sam linebacker
Backside tackle: slip call with the guard
Tight end: 18-inch cutoff block
Run to Split-End Side Versus the Seven-Man Box
A blocker from the backfield is needed on this play. The blocking back 
needs to take a short stretch step and still run at the defensive end. He 
then works up for the linebacker. This will prevent the linebacker from 
taking an isolation fill on the blocking back 
and will buy some time.
The blocking back’s aiming point of the 
defensive end also allows him to have easy 
access to the outside on a pinching defender. 
The play-side tackle has the defensive end 
man on man (figure 8.30), if the tackle doesn’t 
call the guard over to him. The center and 
guard make a Jack Mike call. If the tackle 
makes a call for the guard to come help him, 
the Jack Mike call is off. The tackle’s call has 
priority.

When the tackle calls the guard over 
(figure 8.31), the tackle can really help 
the guard because he is now respon-
sible for the Mike linebacker. If the Will 
linebacker hits the tackle in the face, the 
tackle must block the Will linebacker. 
The fullback will adjust and take the 
Mike linebacker.

Split-Side Stretch Play Versus Even Front
When using an offense with four 
wide receivers, the team will some-
times have to bring a wide receiver 
across the formation to block the 
number 4 defender (figure 8.32) 
and get inside-out position on the 
defender. On a one-back run play, the 
offensive line can block only three on 
the play side.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tackle: reach block
Guard: Jack You call, ricochet technique
Center: Jack You call, 1 technique
Backside guard: slip or call “gone” to tackle
Backside tackle: slip, pull, and overtake; “gone” call
Tight end: 18-inch cutoff block
Six-Man Box
The offense should be able to run all day. The basic rule is to run to the 
A-gap player based on how the players are blocking their personnel. 
If the right guard is better than the opponent’s 3-technique player, the 
offense should run to that side. However, the team should not get locked 
in to rules. If one or two linemen say they are better than the defender, 
the offense should run that way if possible.

Stretch Plays  113
The three-by-one set in the spread offense is a good formation for 
getting numbers to the weak side to run the football. If the weak safety 
is playing games, the offense should go under center or to pistol forma-
tion and make the defense guess which way the play is going to be run. 
The play can always be checked. The 
offense can run the quarterback stretch 
back to the running back’s side of the 
formation.
All games to the 40 defense side 
are handled with the same three-man 
game calls. Again, the tackle and wide 
receiver can protect against the weak 
safety or weak corner fire from the 
boundary (figure 8.33). The offense 
can check to the speed option against 
this stunt, and the defense will have a 
problem.
A change-up used sometimes on the 
backside is to man the guard on a wide 
3-technique defender (figure 8.34). The 
backside tackle pulls and overtakes the 
path up to the linebacker. If the line-
backer runs hard, the linemen use the 
fast-flow technique to block him.
Summary
This chapter covered the blocking schemes of the stretch play to the 
tight-end side versus four different fronts. It also covered the one-back 
and two-back stretch plays to the split-end side with different blocking 
schemes on the perimeter.
In chapter 9, the blocking schemes of the inside zone will be discussed 
and explained. The inside zone is a very popular scheme used by many 
teams. I will share my philosophy related to the inside zone and discuss 
how to use it successfully.

Inside Zone
Most of the running game inside the tackle box is executed with the 
inside zone blocking scheme. When identifying the inside zone blocking 
schemes, terms such as power scoop and power slip are used on the backside 
of plays. Calls such as Jack Read, Jack Me, and Jack You are used on the 
front side of plays. (See chapter 7.)
My philosophy of the inside zone scheme is to first take care of the 
down lineman. He is the level-1 player. It is okay to not get off to the 
linebacker if both linemen need to stay on the down lineman. This is 
called securing level 1. Too many players worry about getting to the line-
backers. The end result is no one ends up blocking the level-1 defender.
The inside zone play can be run out of the I-formation in which the 
fullback goes to the backside of the play as a cutoff blocker. The inside 
zone play is also run with the fullback leading to the play side as an extra 
blocker. When this is done, we use motion to put a wide receiver or H 
back in position to be the cut blocker backside.
Out of the shotgun formation, we run a belly cutback dive play that 
uses the inside zone blocking scheme. This is a quarterback read play 
with an option back as well.
My philosophy is to stretch the defense and make them run from side-
line to sideline. Reverses, options, stretch plays, quick screens, and split 
screens can be run to achieve this movement of the defense. The offense 
can then come back hard inside with the inside zone running game. In 
this chapter, we look at blocking the inside zone versus four defensive 
fronts: odd, even, under front, and 4-3 stack.

116  Complete Offensive Line
Inside Zone Versus an Odd Defense
The tailback lines up 7 yards deep 
(figure 9.1). The fullback is used as a 
backside cut blocker off the backside 
edge. The backside tackle has to decide 
whether to use a 4 or 4I tackle alignment. 
In a 4 tackle alignment, the backside 
tackle aligns head up on the defensive 
tackle. In a 4I alignment, he aligns on 
the inside shade of the defensive tackle. 
These alignments require two different 
types of cutoff blocks.
The odd defensive front includes 
three down linemen and four lineback-
ers. The tailback uses open crossover steps to get square to the line of 
scrimmage. He should aim at the guard’s outside leg or the B gap. Versus 
an odd front, this play reads just like the stretch play. The tackle is the 
first read; the nose guard is the second read.
In a 3-4 front, defensive linemen often perform a lot of movement 
with slants and angles on the defensive front. The running back has to 
read the defensive tackle for his first read. If the first read goes outside, 
the ball should go into the B gap. If the defensive tackle pinches inside, 
the ball should go to the C gap. If the tackle slants outside and the nose 
guard slants hard to the play side, the tailback should be ready to cut 
the ball back behind the nose guard.
A mistake that running backs often make on this play is not pressing 
the line of scrimmage before they attempt to cut. If the running back cuts 
back too quickly, the offensive line, especially the backside guard and 
tackle, will not be in the right position.
The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: tight reach block
Tackle: tight reach block
Center: power scoop from play-side A gap to backside linebacker
Backside guard: power scoop from nose guard to backside line-
backer
Backside tackle: tight cutoff block or 18-inch cutoff block

Inside Zone  117
If there is movement to the inside of the 
play-side tackle, the guard should end up 
in a Queen read until he can work off to the 
play-side linebacker (figure 9.2). The center 
and backside guard power scoop the nose 
guard. The offense needs to handle level 1 
(all the down linemen) first before worry-
ing about getting to the linebackers.
Coaching Point
Offensive linemen should alert each other on the head-up technique. 
Knowing that there may be movement is advantageous. Linemen 
should handle the level-1 defenders first. They should not be in a 
hurry to get to level 2. If they aren’t careful, both linemen will be in 
a hurry to get to the linebacker.
When facing an odd front with the 
outside linebacker in a 6 or 7 technique 
on the tight end (figure 9.3), the offense 
can make a call for a three-man game just 
like the outside stretch play. This play is 
blocked like a stretch play. The football 
should bounce outside on the pinch of the 
linebacker.
The tight end and center should try to 
choke and squeeze the tackle and nose 
guard. The tackle and both guards should 
treat this as if it is the outside stretch play.

118  Complete Offensive Line
Inside Zone Versus an Under Front
Against the under front (figure 9.4), the 
offense must know what kind of nose guard 
they are up against. Is he quick? Can he run? 
Is he a big run stopper and gap player? Can 
the center handle him one on one or does he 
need help?
The offensive linemen execute their 
assignments:
Tight end: tight reach block
Tackle: tight reach block
Guard: stretch step, run track to linebacker
Center: reach nose guard or call for “pop” 
to get help from the play-side guard
Backside guard: power slip to linebacker
Backside tackle: power slip with guard
If the center calls for help from the play-
side guard (figure 9.5), the guard should use 
the drive block technique with his outside 
foot over and up. The inside foot and inside 
arm should come straight off, and he should 
make contact with the same foot and shoul-
der. The guard should stay on the double team as long as possible. The 
play-side linebacker will read isolation and step right up to the guard. 
When the linebacker gets even with the guard, the guard comes off and 
blocks him. If there is a 1-technique or gap player, the guard doubles 
him out to the linebacker.
Inside Zone Versus a 4-3 Defense
This should be an effective play because of all the bubbles in the 4-3 
defense. The backside 1-technique player must be controlled on this play. 
The center should make a presnap read on the depth and alignment of 
the middle linebacker. The center should not overzone the linebacker or 
let him fall back inside on the play.

The offensive linemen execute their assignments:
Tight end: tight reach block
Tackle: stretch step, run track to linebacker
Guard: tight reach block
Center: stretch step, run track to Mike linebacker
Backside guard: cut off 1-technique player
Backside tackle: stretch step, run track to linebacker
The zone and stretch plays should look as similar as possible on the 
first stretch step. Helmet placement is very important, especially on inside 
zone plays. The goal is to get the defender running hard to the outside, 
if possible. If the defenders are big run stoppers, the linemen need to be 
ready to drop their hips and knock them off the ball. At the very least, 
they need to hold the line of scrimmage. Against any inside pinch moves, 
the uncovered lineman should be ready to double with the covered 
lineman (figure 9.6). The uncovered lineman 
should aim his second step to a point behind 
the defender’s inside foot. The uncovered line-
man needs to be able to stop all penetration 
and maintain the line of scrimmage. If two 
offensive linemen must be used on a pinch 
defender, then they let the linebacker go free.
Versus an under shift of the defensive front 
(figure 9.7), power combo blocks are a must. 
The covered offensive lineman must keep his 
play-side arm free and out of the block so he 
is able to come off if the linebacker attacks the 
line of scrimmage.
If the Sam linebacker walks up on the line 
of scrimmage, the tackle and tight end must 
make an out call.
If the nose guard is aligned in a shaded 
position on the center (figure 9.8), he needs 
to stretch step to the play-side A gap and 
work the same foot, same shoulder on the 
nose guard. He hangs for the backside guard 
as long as possible and then comes off on the 
Mike linebacker when the Mike linebacker 
commits to the line of scrimmage.

Another change-up that can be used is to 
fold the backside with the guard and center. 
The center works a back block to the V of the 
nose guard’s neck. The guard executes a drop 
step and pulls to the play-side A gap to block 
the Mike linebacker (figure 9.9).
Inside Zone Versus 
an Even Defense (40 Looks)
Many defenses try to disguise the 40 even front and the 4-3 defense with 
cheat alignments of the middle linebacker. If the Mike linebacker commits 
to the play-side A gap, the offense should treat it like a 4-3 defense and 
go with it (figure 9.10a). If the Mike linebacker gets to a point backside at 
which the center has to go backside to block him, then the offense should 
treat it like an even front (figure 9.10b).

declares, backside block man on man
The center must always be alert for the 
pinch. He always anticipates this and is ready 
to double to the play-side linebacker (figure 
9.11). The backside guard has to execute a cutoff 
block as the defensive lineman loops outside. 
The guard should squeeze off to the linebacker.

Inside Zone  121
The five offensive linemen zone step off the line of scrimmage and 
stay square to the line. By staying square, they will handle a lot of the 
movements that the defensive linemen are trying to execute. This is why 
it is so important for the center and guards to keep 18-inch splits and for 
the tackles to keep 2-foot splits.
When the defender is in a shaded alignment 
on the center, the offense should treat it like 
the 4-3 defense. The only difference is that the 
Mike linebacker is much more in the play-side 
A gap (figure 9.12). With this being the case, 
the center may have to tag the nose guard and 
abort a little quicker than he would against a 
true Mike linebacker in order to get his man.
The fold block versus the even front is no more than a linebacker trap. 
Calls have to be made on this scheme. The play-side guard has to know 
that the center is no longer working the play-side A gap and that the 
guard is man on man with the 3-technique defender.
This is a great scheme as long as the 
3-technique defender plays a 3 and does not 
pinch. Against an even front, the offense will 
usually get a lot of 3 techniques to 1 techniques 
and 1 techniques to 3 techniques. To counter this 
and take the pressure off the guard so he can 
come off the football, the guard’s assignment 
should be to do a tight reach (figure 9.13) and 
not worry about the pinch.
The guard must tight reach and rip off the outside shoulder of the 
3-technique defender. If the 3-technique player pinches to the inside, the 
guard doesn’t worry. Instead, he continues to the linebacker just like on a 
stretch or inside zone play. The pulling or folding guard folds and reads 
the inside half of the 3-technique player on his way to the linebacker. If the 
3-technique player widens, the guard goes up and blocks the linebacker. 
If the 3-technique player pinches, the guard trap blocks him inside out, 
and the tailback needs to hit it real tight.
If the backside tackle gets the fold call, he may have to take a stretch 
path to go get the backside linebacker deeper inside. This is especially 
true if the offense runs the inside dive from the shotgun.

Summary
This chapter covered the inside zone blocking scheme, including how to 
use it successfully against the four major defensive fronts. Power scoops 
and power slips are often used in this scheme, along with Jack and Queen 
combo blocks. The main point in this chapter is that the offense must 
take care of level 1 first.
The next chapter will cover the blocking schemes for the option play. 
When preparing for an upcoming game, one of the first questions the 
defense will ask is, “Do they run the option?” The option play can be 
difficult to defend if performed correctly. Let’s move on and learn to 
block for the option.

123
10
Option
Every defensive staff that meets to get ready for an opponent 
asks one question: Does the opponent run the option and, if so, what 
forms of the option do they run? I like to go into a game being able to 
run an option play from all formations. Once your opponent realizes that 
you will run the option, the opponent will cut back much of their twist 
game and secondary blitzes.
The quarterback’s style will dictate just how much option the team 
uses. However, a pure drop-back style quarterback can still run the speed 
option from under center or out of the pistol formation.
Outside Zone
The option game that I prefer uses 
the outside zone scheme. Figure 
10.1 shows how to block for some of 
the tight-end option plays using the 
outside zone scheme versus the four 
common defensive fronts.
The quarterback needs to pitch the 
football off the end man on the line of 
scrimmage, whether it be the defensive 
down lineman, outside linebacker, or 
secondary safety man.
The blocking rules for the offensive line are the same as the rules for 
the outside stretch play because the tight end goes up into the second 
level to block the linebacker.

Figure 10.1  Speed option versus 
Okie defensive front.

124  Complete Offensive Line
In the I-formation, the speed option is the base option used to run the 
stretch scheme with the offensive line. The quarterback steps back with 
the foot opposite the direction he is going to run the play. If the option is 
to the right, he steps back with his left foot, replaces with his right, and 
then runs the option, attacking the outside shoulder of the defender at 
the end of the line of scrimmage. The fullback runs an arc release and 
works to block the outside shoulder or leg of the support player. The 
tight end uses an inside release to block the onside inside linebacker. The 
tight end should make sure that he doesn’t get too far inside and knock 
the play-side tackle off his block. The tight end can cheat his split to 3 
feet so that he has room to take an inside stretch step. After he takes his 
stretch step, he works in and out to block the inside linebacker. The tight 
end must work to stay square to the line of scrimmage. The play-side 
tackle should use a stretch reach block on the 5-technique defender. He 
should sell out to reach the defender and should expect no help from the 
tight end. If the tight end can get a tag on the defensive tackle and still 
do his job, he should do it; if not, he should not do it.
Coaching Point
Here’s one thing I’ve learned about option football in nearly 40 years 
of coaching: If the offense blocks the linebackers, the option play will 
gain yardage. This is a big selling point to the offensive line. A lineman 
must do whatever it takes—dive cut, fall, and so on—to get some kind 
of hit on the linebacker. The quarterback and tailback can also execute 
a counter action in the backfield in order to hold the linebackers.
If the offense uses a pistol formation or under center with one back, 
the blocking scheme is still the same for the offensive line.
The tight end has a rule that if he gets 
man on man outside, as shown in figure 
10.2, he must block man on. The tight end 
should make the call to the tackle and 
guard, letting them know that they have a 
three-man game. This should be the same 
call that is made on the stretch boss play. 
The defense will often use various schemes 
off the edges to try to confuse the quarter-
back. The tight end and tackle have to be 
coordinated so they can make the right 
calls to block whatever blitz or front the 
defense may show.

Option to the Tight-End Side 
Versus an Even 40 Front
Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show two different 
schemes versus an over defense with a 
7-technique defensive end. If the defen-
sive end is a very good player, the offense 
should take him out of the game by King 
blocking him. This is the same scheme 
used on the stretch boss play from the 
stretch outside zone play. Blocking rules 
are the same as the rules for the stretch 
boss scheme versus 40 defense.
Even though the center declared the 
Mike linebacker backside and the back-
side tackle could lock down his block on 
the defensive end, I prefer to zone the 
linebacker through the B gap and secure 
the backside weak A gap and weak B gap 
against blitzes and run-throughs.
If the defensive end is a big, slow 
player, the offense can use the loop 
scheme to the free safety and pitch off 
the slower defender who is not used to 
playing the quarterback. The play-side 
tackle on the tight-end side has to use a split-side technique of in and out 
to block the first play-side linebacker. This scheme is particularly useful 
if the quarterback is not a great runner. It helps to get the ball out of the 
quarterback’s hands much more quickly. If an offense uses the option a 
lot and mixes in both schemes of looping the tight end and King blocking 
the box, this really makes it tough on the defensive front.
If there is movement up front, the tight end and tackle will King the 
box and pick up all blitzes. I have the offense work against two different 
slants with the defense in an even front: 2-gap slants (figure 10.5a) and 
1-gap slants (figure 10.5b) on the fire zone series of blitzes. The 1-gap 
slants are simple blitzes and shouldn’t be a problem to pick up. The 2-gap 
fire zone blitzes are the ones that require the most work.

Coaching Point
Here’s an important coaching point for the play-side tight end, tackle, 
and guard: Whoever gets to level 2 and blocks the play-side line-
backer first will allow the other blocker (either the tackle or guard) 
to continue on to level 3 and block the free safety.
Option Versus the 4-3 Defense
If the tight end is facing a 9-technique defensive end, the tight end 
needs to work the in-and-out technique on the linebacker. The play-side 
tackle should come off with the outside foot but should focus on execut-
ing a deuce-tag technique with the play-side guard to make sure the 
3-technique defender gets no penetration (figure 
10.6). Everyone else on the line blocks the stretch 
play. The play-side guard and tackle must block 
the 3-technique player as much as possible. If 
the offense has to waste a double team on the 
3-technique player and the tackle doesn’t get off 
to the linebacker, this is better than forcing the 
quarterback to pitch off the 3-technique player.
If the defensive end lines up in a 6 or 7 technique on the tight end, the 
tight end should make a King call to the tackle, King the box, and let the 
quarterback pitch off the secondary support player. Another option is 
using the loop technique on the 6-technique defender and then pitching 
off the 6-technique defender.
Option Versus the Under Front
On the option versus an under front, blocking assignments are the same 
as on stretch boss to the tight-end side versus an under front. For blocking 
the under front, the coach must know whether his center can block the 
shaded nose guard and not allow penetration on the play. If the center 
is having a problem with the wide shade or gap player, the offense can 
put the ricochet technique into effect and ricochet the nose guard. The 
backside guard has to judge the alignment of the backside linebacker. 
He must decide whether to shoot through and get the linebacker, leaving 
the backside tackle singled on the 3-technique defender.

Option  127
Option Versus the Bear Defense
When defensive coaches jump to the bear defense and give a steady dose 
of this up front, the first thing the offense should try is the speed option. 
It goes back to the old philosophy that 
if the defense puts them all inside, the 
offense wants to run the football outside 
(figure 10.8). The tight end will usually 
have a man-on-man outside rule in 
effect versus this bear front.
When blocking the bear front on the speed option, the offense uses 
a triple blocking scheme from the center to the backside tackle. This 
allows the center to cover the front-side A gap on the stretch scheme. 
If the 3-technique defender pinches to the inside, the A gap is covered.
If any kind of 6- or 7-technique defender is lined up on the tight end, 
the tight end needs to King the box. The offense must always cover the 
front-side A, B, and C gaps while letting the quarterback cleanly get 
down the line of scrimmage to the pitchman.
The options on the split-end side have one rule. First, the offense should 
try to run to the numbers. If everything else is even, the offense should 
try to run to the deepest linebackers.
Figure 10.9a shows the deepest linebacker aligned in the play-side A 
gap. The play-side tackle has a great chance to get in and get this backer. 
In figure 10.9b, the backer is in the B gap. This is a very tough get for the 
tackle. Most of the time, a crackback block on the linebacker by a wide 
receiver is used to get the B-gap linebacker.

front blocked like 50 defense.
The front side of the under front is 
blocked just like the Okie, or 50 defense

the stretch play.

Another technique that can be used if the defensive ends are playing 
wide is to have the tackle step with the outside foot like a reach but then 
come off inside the defensive end for the inside linebacker. This is called 
the fake reach block. The tackle should go up hard inside and block the 
linebacker.
The tackle needs to make a call to the guard and center to let them 
know that the tackle is coming inside to get the linebacker. Once this 
call is made, the guard can combo off the A-gap player and work off to 
the backside linebacker. On the backside, the guard can handle it two 
ways: slip through to the linebacker (figure 10.10a) or man it up and lock 
down the backside (figure 10.10b). A potential problem when locking it 
down is the weak linebacker run-through. Locking the backside keeps 
the defensive end from chasing, but it frees the weak A gap. I like to use 
the slip option and handle the defensive end with reverses and nakeds.
Man on Man Outside
The odd stack is a very tough defense against 
the speed option because of the bad angles 
on the front side as the blockers try to get up 
to the linebackers (figure 10.11). The offense 
has to block the 5-technique defender and 
hope to pitch off the scrape linebacker. When 
the offense does this, the play really starts to 
get strung out, and the quarterback usually 
dips up inside the B gap.
A great scheme to counter the 3-3 stack 
defense is the X blocking scheme on the 
option. The play-side tackle veer blocks 
the B gap, stopping all linebacker run-throughs, and blocks the middle 
linebacker. The play-side guard loops to the outside of the 5-technique 
defensive tackle and blocks the play-side Sam linebacker. This forces the 
5-technique defensive tackle to play the quarterback.

Option  129
A base adjustment to the odd stack is to get in a three-by-one set and try 
to pull the defense to the side with the three receivers. The offense should 
get more of a conventional Okie 50 defensive front and should run the 
option out the weak side. The three wide receivers force the defense to 
pull the linebackers to the outside to cover. If the defense chooses to leave 
the linebacker in the box, the offense should be throwing the football.
Summary
The option is by far the most worked-on play by a defense. For the offense, 
the option is great out of all formations, and it forces the defense to be 
perfect in their assignments. This leads into the chapter on pass protec-
tion. Protection and drills for improving skills in this area will be fully 
covered in the next chapter.

Pass Protection
My philosophy of pass protection is to be very aggressive and 
solid at the guard and center positions. The tackles must keep the outside 
edges strong. I have a saying about how fast the linemen need to get set 
on pass protection: “They can’t get set fast enough.” However fast they 
can get set, it is not fast enough.
My offensive linemen use three types of pass sets: the post, kick slide, 
and vertical. The linemen must master all three, so we work on sets 
every day before practice and sometimes after practice. The technique 
of pass protection is a phase of football that can be worked on every day 
year-round because players don’t need to have pads on to work on their 
technique.

132  Complete Offensive Line
75 Percent–25 Percent Advantage
Regarding percentages of position that an offensive lineman wants on 
the defender, a 75 percent to 25 percent advantage is the ideal position. 
We call this alignment the 75 percent–25 percent offensive advantage 
(figure 11.1).
Figure 11.1  75 percent–25 percent offensive advantage.
Some coaches want the offensive lineman’s outside leg in the defend-
er’s crotch. This is the same thing I coach, but I stress that the offensive 
lineman must look at his aiming point. If the offensive lineman is told 
“foot to crotch,” he is not expected to look at the defender’s crotch. The 
aiming point is the defender’s inside breast. The offensive lineman needs 
big eyes on the defender’s inside breast. The offensive lineman must 
never look at the rusher’s head.
On the 75 percent–25 percent advantage, linemen should use a kick slide 
set or vertical set. The offensive guards and center will short set this align-
ment. A short pass set means the lineman gives no ground and gets hands 
on the pass rusher as quickly as possible. For the 75 percent–25 percent 
advantage, the lineman’s footwork should involve picking up and replacing 
with the outside foot first, the inside foot second. The defender is already 
aligned where the lineman wants him; this is perfect position. There is no 
reason to set inside or outside, so the lineman should just step and replace.
A common error made by offensive linemen is to set out and get shoe 
to shoe or head up (figure 11.2), opening up the inside rushing lane. The 
lineman must maintain his 75 percent–25 percent relationship to keep 
the rusher outside. Against a real tight 3- or 5-technique defender, the 
lineman can use what is known as a short post to cover the slant. This is 
described in the upcoming section on the post set.

Pass Protection  133

or shoe-to-shoe alignment.
Post Set
The post set will push the offensive blocker back into a 75 percent–25 
percent advantage position. A 50 percent–50 percent advantage even is a 
head-up shoe-to-shoe alignment. To get back to 75-25, the lineman takes 
an inside-foot post set to gain this relationship (figure 11.3).
Figure 11.3  25 percent–75 percent defensive alignment. Defender in an inside-
shade alignment on the offensive blocker.

134  Complete Offensive Line
The footwork is very important in gaining position, but the lineman 
must also remember to get his hands on the defender as quickly as pos-
sible. When working the hands, the lineman should try to imagine the 
inside hand becoming as strong as possible. He should place it inside the 
defender’s breastplate as quickly as possible; the outside hand should be 
inside the framework as well. The feet and hands have to work together as 
one movement. The only way to have tight hands is to have tight elbows. 
Coaches should constantly relay this point to players while working on 
pass protection.
The inside shade gives the defender 
a 75 percent–25 percent advantage. 
The offensive blocker must work back 
to get head up and get at least back 
to 50 percent–50 percent even (figure 
11.4a).
A two-step post set (figure 11.4b) will get the offensive lineman back to 75 
percent–25 percent. Against the inside shade, the lineman should make sure 
he at least gets back to head up and should fight to stay at least 50 percent–50 
percent. The post sets are still easier to do than setting a 3 or 5 technique.
Tackle Play
If the tackle is touching the defender, he uses a one-step kick and then 
quick sets the rusher. At the tackle position, the offensive lineman must 
be ready to cut angles and must be able to read the proper angle to take so 
he can block the pass rusher with a one-step, two-step, 
or three-step kick slide. If he can’t use one of these, the 
tackle must use a vertical pass set. The one-step kick is 
similar to the guard setting a 3 technique. The tackle 
wants to get his hands on the defender as quickly as 
possible while making sure he doesn’t overset him 
and get heads up (figure 11.5). If the rusher is hardly 
touching the tackle, the tackle can set out and get to 
a foot-to-crotch 75 percent–25 percent relationship 
because the defender is one man removed. This is 
done by using a two-step kick set (figure 11.6).
When the defender widens to a point where he is a couple yards away 
from the blocker, the blocker can use another technique called half the 
distance. This is used more often by the tackles than the guards or center.

Pass Protection  135
A defensive end will often align outside wide and tilt to the inside. 
This alignment makes the tackles feel very uneasy, and they tend to jump 
outside and then get beat inside.
Tackles judge half the distance between the rusher and the tackle. The 
tackle must judge this spot on the line of scrimmage and must also judge 
the depth of the pass set. This is because the junction point is not on the 
line of scrimmage but at an angle deep in the backfield. Understanding 
how to judge these angles is very important for the tackles.
I have never had a tackle get beat when he got a three-step pass set and 
was square to the line of scrimmage. This is usually a two-step kick set 
and should never be over a three-step kick. The imaginary spot halfway 
between is the key to the technique. Staying as square as possible to the 
line of scrimmage while getting depth is also a big key to success.
Vertical Set
The vertical pass set will allow the blocker to get more depth quicker, 
but the width of the pocket will be smaller. When going against a pure 
speed rusher who is an upfield speed guy, the offensive lineman should 
use the vertical pass set. On the vertical pass set, the lineman keeps the 
shoulders square to the line of scrimmage and reads the inside number 
of the pass rusher.
Learning the Post Pass Set
As stated earlier, a lineman should use the post pass 
set on a head-up to inside pass rush defender. The 
term short post is used when the lineman is facing 
a defender in a tight outside shade who may rush 
inside (figure 11.7). It is also used when the lineman 
is facing a defender in a head-up even alignment or an inside-shade 
alignment. The post set for the tackles is taught in the same way as the 
post is taught for the guards.
When learning the post, linemen should start with the same balanced 
stance used for the running game. The blocker reads the defender’s feet 
to read the alignment. If a defender is head up or inside, the blocker 
steps with the inside foot first. He steps inside and slightly gains ground 
until he is strong with the inside leg. Then he puts the inside foot into 
the ground and holds (sticks it). When taking the step inside, many

blockers make the following mistake: When the foot hits the ground, it 
flies back behind the blocker so that the inside foot is now back and the 
outside foot is up. When the inside foot moves, the outside foot should 
simultaneously come with it so the blocker can maintain balance. A lack 
of balance and poor positioning are the main reasons a blocker gets beat.
When the blocker takes his inside post step, his inside hand comes 
hard to the rusher’s inside breast. Tight elbows make for tight hands. 
The blocker should get his hands on the defender as quickly as possible. 
If the defender is lined up with an inside shade, the blocker should post 
the rusher on a two-step post and try to get back the 75 percent–25 per-
cent position. The blocker must get to at least 50 percent–50 percent. He 
should carry his body weight on the inside half of his body. This goes 
back to mental weight and knowing how to adjust his body while not 
worrying about the defender. The blocker should read the defender’s 
inside number. He should never look at the defender’s head. He needs 
to focus on the inside breast.
Kick Slide Technique on Outside Shade
The first thing to remember on the kick slide pass set is to not overset. The 
blocker should not set out; he should get back to 50 percent–50 percent on 
the rusher. Defensive linemen are taught to read the blocker’s shoulders. 
They read how fast the blocker jumps out, rises up, or turns to the side-
lines. This tells them what moves they need to make. If the blocker jumps 
outside fast, the defender is going to go inside. If the blocker rises up, he 
will get bull rushed. If the blocker turns and drops his second step in the 
bucket, the defender will use an underarm rip or pull and swim inside.
Coaching Point
Pass blockers need to stay aggressive up and down the line of 
scrimmage, not into the line of scrimmage. Too often players take 
a good set and then lunge into the line of scrimmage. A great pass 
blocking guard or center learns to slide firmly up and down the line 
of scrimmage. A tackle should be at more of an angle off the line of 
scrimmage. The blocker must be aggressive on these angles. Over-
extending and lunging forward may result in becoming top heavy. 
This is the biggest mistake made in pass protection.

Pass Protection  137
Every time a blocker sets an outside technique, he should set it and 
be ready for the inside move. The best tactic versus the inside slant is 
to punch the rusher as quickly as possible and try to shock him or get 
him off balance. The blocker’s inside hand should be dominant if pos-
sible. But if the blocker can shock the defender with both hands, that’s 
great. When working the pass set drills, linemen should always set three 
one-step kick sets. After setting the kick sets, they should set three more 
kick sets, but this time, as soon as the outside foot hits the ground, the 
linemen should come back inside on a two-step post. This simulates a 
3-technique defender using an inside rush on the lineman as he sets out 
to block the 3-technique defender.
Figure 11.8  Tackle using a one-step kick set versus an outside-shade defender.
If the blocker sets and stays square to the line of scrimmage as much 
as he can, this forces the rusher to think, and the blocker has gained an 
advantage. The defender is waiting for the offensive lineman to tell him 
what move to use. If the defender has to stop and think because the line-
man is square to the line of scrimmage, the lineman has the advantage—at 
this point, he wins.
Versus the Outside-Shade Technique
By using a one-step kick set, the blocker can get the position he needs to 
defeat a defender in an outside-shade technique (figure 11.8). The blocker 
takes the first step with his outside foot back about 6 inches and resets 
his inside foot. He must use quick hands. He reads the rusher’s inside 
breast and gets his hands inside. The blocker should never look at the 
pass rusher’s hand.

138  Complete Offensive Line
Vertical Pass Set
The vertical set is used when the tackle and guards 
are responsible for blocking three or four defenders 
without any help (figure 11.9). It is also used when 
the tackle is facing a fast inside rusher and wants to 
avoid oversetting him; in this case, the tackle will use 
a vertical set to cut the angle.
For the vertical set, the blocker takes a 45-degree 
kick slide step with the outside foot. Once he performs 
the kick slide, he drags the inside foot straight back. Then he sets one, 
two, three steps straight back with the outside foot moving vertically 
back from the line of scrimmage.
Vertical Set Against a Wall
Offensive linemen can learn the vertical set by working against a wall. 
The lineman sets up about 2 feet away from the wall, facing the wall. He 
takes a 45-degree kick slide step toward the wall and drags the inside 
foot straight back. He then moves vertically down the wall with a one-step 
kick. When he is comfortable with that, he performs a vertical two-step 
kick backward down the wall. He finishes with a 45-degree kick step and 
drag one, two, three. The lineman stays square to the wall, performing the 
vertical pass sets. The wall keeps him going backward and prevents him 
from getting width. This teaches the lineman to get depth on his pass set.
Pass Protection Drills
Players can work on pass protection drills during the off-season and the 
summer. Successful pass protection is a combination of balance and body 
control. Pass protection drills help each player gain control of his body 
and learn proper technique. All linemen should be able to work from a 
three-point or two-point stance on all pass protection drills.

Kick Sets and Vertical Sets
To begin, the linemen on the left side of the line execute three one-step 
kick sets on the command “set hut,” “set hut,” “set hut.” The linemen on 
the right side of the line then execute three one-step kick sets. Next, the 
linemen on the left side execute three one-step kick sets and then drive 
back inside on a two-step post to simulate blocking a pinching defender. 
The linemen on the right side then repeat the same pattern.
Next, the linemen on the left side execute two-step kick sets. The line-
men on the right side then repeat the pattern. Guards do the same sets 
because the technique used is the same as fan protection versus the 50 
defense. The guard has to take a two-step kick to block the 5-technique 
defensive tackle.
The tackles then work on the three-step kick slide. During this time, the 
guards work on performing the one-step kick and coming back inside on 
the two-step post to simulate blocking a pinching defender to the inside.
Finally, the linemen work on the vertical set. This includes the tackles 
and guards. On the vertical set, the tackle sets back three steps, and the 
guard sets back two steps. Then the linemen work on the sort technique 
and gap techniques. For the sort technique, there are three defenders 
and only two blockers.
All of this is done with nothing but sandbags. Use sandbags on the first 
and second sets of each drill. The third set is done on air; the lineman 
simply takes the set as if in a game. This allows the linemen to move 
with quickness after using the 20-pound sandbag on the first two sets.
When the guards and tackles perform these sets from the down stance, 
they hold the sandbags on the ground with both hands. When they take 
the post and kick sets, they need to bring the sandbag up and punch on 
the first step of the post or the first step on the kick set.

140
Kick Sets and Vertical Sets With Chest Pass
The second drill is similar to the first except it includes a chest pass at 
the end of the drill. In part 2 of the drill, the linemen post set out of the 
two-point stance holding the sandbags in both hands. After executing 
the post from the down stance, the linemen continue to post and punch 
four more times down the line. When the linemen hit the fifth step, they 
execute a punch and throw the sandbag like a chest pass in basketball. 
They then repeat this drill from the two-point stance. After the post set, 
they throw the sandbag on the fifth step.
Double-Punch Drill
In the double-punch drill, the blocker hits one defender and then quickly 
comes off to a second defender. This drill requires three players in each 
group. While one group is working, the next group should be ready to go 
as soon as the first group finishes. After the first group finishes and starts 
to rotate players, the coach begins coaching the next group on the drill. 
The coach continues coaching while each group rotates.
The group of three should include two bag holders and one offensive 
pass blocker. The first bag holder is set out on a loose outside shoulder 
technique so the offensive blocker has to take a one-step kick set and 
punch the bag holder. As soon as he punches the first bag holder, the 
blocker must come back inside and punch the second bag holder, who 
was off the ball and comes late.
Twist Drill
My offensive linemen do the twist drill on Wednesdays and sometimes 
Thursdays during the season. Start with the left guard and left tackle. 
Two defenders execute a tackle-end twist or an end-tackle twist. The 
offensive tackle and the guard work against both of these games. Only 
work two at a time.
The left guard and center are now in focus. The two defenders work 
a tackle-nose twist or a nose-tackle twist on the center and guard. A 
defensive end can be substituted if the coach wants the offensive tackle 
to work on reacting against a player with more speed.

141
The center and right guard now work the same two twists—the tackle-
nose and nose-tackle twist. Lastly, the drill moves to the right guard and 
right tackle; these two players work against the tackle-end twist and the 
end-tackle twist.
When the first-team players have each completed their two pickups, 
the second-team offensive linemen should rotate into the drill. Repeat the 
drill with the second-team players, starting on the left side.
Coaching Points
The guards’ alignments are far off the football. The center must learn to 
snap the football and get back even or deeper on the line of scrimmage 
while the guards pick up the twist games.
One-on-One Pass Rush Versus Defensive Line
We do this drill for at least 9 minutes a day on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, 
and Thursdays during the season. Start by lining up the five offensive 
linemen on the line of scrimmage. To begin the drill, the left tackle blocks 
the defensive end on two pass rushes. Next, the left guard blocks for two 
pass rushes versus the defensive tackle, followed by the center for two 
on a defensive tackle, the right guard for two on a defensive tackle, and 
then the right tackle for two on the defensive end. Then the second-team 
linemen rotate in to the drill and repeat the process.
Changing the snap count often will help the offensive blocker and will 
also make the defensive lineman watch the football. The center uses a 
shotgun snap (snapping the ball to the manager) on each repetition so 
the defensive lineman sees the ball being snapped.

142
Set With Weighted Ball
The lineman gets in a great three-point stance while holding a 6-pound 
weighted ball in both hands. On the command of “set, hut,” the lineman 
takes either a post set or kick set and chest passes the weighted ball to a 
teammate. The lineman should end up in a perfect pass protector position. 
He freezes in this position until the coach releases him. The lineman’s 
partner then repeats the drill, passing the ball back to him.
Coaching Points
I prefer that players use more kick sets than post sets because the kick 
set is more difficult. Because guards should use a three-point stance all 
the time except during the 2-minute offense, guards should do more work 
down in a three-point stance rather than up in a two-point stance. The 
tackles should work more out of a two-point stance than a three-point 
stance.
When working out of a two-point stance, linemen must learn to stay 
down in a good bent-knee position without bending their back. Both post 
and kick sets are a two-step slide.
The lineman must be sure to work with tight elbows and execute a 
basketball-style chest pass. He should aim the pass to hit his partner in 
the face mask. The lineman needs to stay in great football position while 
executing the drill.
Set and Pass the Ball
Each lineman works with a partner. The lineman holds a weighted ball in 
both hands. He can begin the drill in a two- or three-point stance. On the 
command “set, hut,” the lineman executes a post or kick set. This time he 
continues to post or kick set for four or five steps with his partner as they 
pass the ball back and forth. Linemen should post set for two repetitions 
and kick set for three or four repetitions of the drill so they get more kick 
sets than post sets.

Sumo Pass Protection in the Hoops
This is the favorite off-season 
drill for many offensive linemen. 
Place a hoop on a yard line so 
the hoop is split down the middle. 
One offensive lineman stands on 
one side of the line in the hoop, 
and another lineman stands on 
the other side of the line in the 
hoop (figure 11.10a).
Players must keep their 
heads back; there are no head 
butts. Each lineman places one 
hand in the armpit of the other 
lineman. The outside hand is 
placed on the outside of the 
partner’s upper arm (figure 
11.10b).
On the command “go,” each 
player tries to throw the other 
out of the hoop (figure 11.10c). 
The player must sink his hips 
and really try to hold his center of 
gravity. After the players go, they 
are free to use hand replace-
ments on each other—whatever 
they need to do to get the other 
out of the hoop.
Coaching Points
This drill will show which players 
give second and third efforts. A 
quitter will have a very difficult 
time with this drill. This is a very 
competitive drill that indicates 
who is tough and who likes to 
compete. To help avoid head butts, the players can begin with their heads 
offset on each other’s shoulders.
Keep score of wins and losses. Create an elimination tournament to find 
out who is King of the Hoops.

Kick Slide Three-Man Punch
This drill is used to help guards, tackles, and centers work on the kick 
slide set. A lineman lines up on a yard line. (Two linemen can do this drill 
at the same time.) Three defenders stand to one side, spaced out 2 to 3 
yards and staggered in alignment (figure 11.11a).
On the command “set, hut,” the lineman kick slides and punches the 
number 1 defender (figure 11.11b). After punching number 1, the lineman 
continues the kick slide and punches number 2, then he kick slides and 
punches number 3 (figure 11.11, c and d). After the lineman punches the 
number 3 defender, he should lock up and finish this defender off to the 
outside.

Tackles can use the same procedure to work on vertical pass sets. Two 
tackles line up on a yard line. Three defenders stand to one side, spaced 
out 2 to 3 yards and staggered. On the command “set, hut,” the tackles 
punch the number 1 defender and then the number 2 defender. When 
the tackles get to the number 3 defender, they punch the defender, lock 
him up, and finish him off to the outside.

Run Blocking in the Hoops
This is a great lower-body drill that helps players learn to sink their hips 
and keep a high-quality base. Place a hoop on a yard line so the hoop 
is split down the middle. One offensive lineman stands on one side of 
the line in the hoop, and another lineman stands on the other side of the 
line in the hoop.
Each player should be in a balanced two-point stance. The players 
should offset their heads so they have an ear-to-ear relationship and 
their heads are aligned with each other’s shoulders but not touching. 
Each lineman has his hands on his thighs. On the command “set, hut,” 
each lineman tries to get his hands inside the other’s hands and drive 
the other out of the hoop. The linemen must be sure to keep their hips 
low and keep a wide base with leverage.
Coaching Points
This drill will show which players give second and third efforts. A quitter 
will have a very difficult time with this drill. The drill will also indicate which 
players have great command of their hands (i.e., the players who get their 
hands inside the other player’s hands at the start of the drill).
Keep score of wins and losses. Create an elimination tournament to 
find out who is King of the Run Blockers.

Pass Protection  147
Five-Man Sled
The five-man sled can be used when the offensive linemen need leg work 
and need to improve their leg drive. (Alternatively, the five-man wheel 
trainer could be used.) Change the snap count with each repetition. Start 
with four 5- to 10-yard drives, then rotate the second group into the drill.
The players should reset after 5 yards. They should change the foot 
used for the lead step. My linemen do two left-foot runs to each right-foot 
run, if possible. The linemen should keep the shoulder pads low, keep 
the back flat, and use tight elbows with great punch. They should always 
use powerful, choppy steps and maintain a good wide base.
Coaching Points
If things aren’t going well and the coach needs to get the players’ atten-
tion, he can have the players drive the sled for an extensive time. When 
the coach calls the snap count, the players come off and drive the sled 
the length of the field. Two or three shots of this will get their attention. I 
use this about two times a season, and things always seem to pick up.
Linemen may be offset to the right or left. If they are, they should use 
zone steps to execute the block on the sled.
Summary
Pass protection needs to be aggressive and solid. This chapter covered 
several types of pass sets, techniques, and drills. Learning the proper 
way to perform pass protection drills will help the offensive lineman 
improve and refine his skills. And when the linemen are skillful in this 
area, it makes for a very happy quarterback. In the next chapter, pass 
progression and drills will be covered. Several drills will be broken down 
and explained so the lineman understands his purpose during pass 
progression. Many of these drills will simulate real football situations.

Pass 
Progression 
and Drills
This chapter presents a seven-step progression of drills that will 
help offensive linemen develop their skills in pass protection. We work 
on this progression of drills every day in fundamental and individual 
practices. Each one of these phases has its own value and will help an 
offensive lineman become a better pass protector.
The pass progression drills are as follows:
1.	Shuffle mirror
2.	Push–pull
3.	Pressure hop
4.	Combination
5.	Punch
6.	Sandbags
7.	Tap

150  Complete Offensive Line
Each phase of this pass progression work focuses on certain areas 
pertaining to pass protection. In the shuffle mirror drill, linemen work 
on body balance as well as good movement of the feet. The push–pull 
drill helps with body control and staying balanced. Pressure hop helps 
linemen learn how to stop a bull rusher and how to control their body 
to stop a powerful force coming at them. The combination drill puts all 
of the phases together and allows the linemen to practice working in a 
realistic gamelike situation. The sandbags are great for learning a punch 
while still controlling the upper body. Punching is a big part of pass pro-
tection, and the punch drill is used to work on timing and balance during 
the punch. The tap drill also allows linemen to work on the timing of the 
punch. These seven steps will help linemen break down the individual 
segments of pass protection and then combine them together.
All of the drills are run out of the two-cone setup. Two cones should 
be set 6 yards apart. Once the drill is set up, the centers should partner 
up first down the line behind the cones, followed by the guards and 
then the tackles.
The partners will sprint into the drill on the coach’s command. When 
they receive the command “back,” they will sprint out of the drill to the 
outside. If the partners don’t sprint into and out of the drill, the coach 
may have them do up-downs or may kick them out of the drill.
In this chapter, each progression drill is broken down, including 
descriptions of the procedure and purpose for each drill along with 
coaching points.
Shuffle Mirror
The shuffle mirror is also known as mirror dodge or chase the rabbit. Two 
cones are needed. Set the cones 6 or 7 yards apart. Draw a chalk line or 
use a yard line out on the football field. The offensive lineman can crowd 
the line but must never go over.
The offensive lineman gets in a great two-point stance with both hands 
behind his back. He gets in position so his shoulders are over his knees 
(figure 12.1). The lineman should stage his stance according to the side 
he plays on. He should get his head up and get in good ready football 
position. He should never look at the defender’s head. Big eyes are a 
must, just like in the run game. The lineman must read the defender’s 
numbers. The defender will line up directly in front of the lineman and 
off the line about a yard. This is done so there will be space in between 
the two players.

151
On the command “go,” the 
defender moves quickly be-
tween the two cones. The offen-
sive lineman leads with his 
direction-side foot. For example, 
if the defender goes to the line-
man’s right, the lineman will 
lead with the right foot. This is 
not a hop or pound. The lineman 
shuffles squarely to the “rabbit,” 
mirroring him perfectly. The 
lineman must keep his hands 
locked behind his back all the 
way through the drill. This will 
help the player learn to con-
trol his upper body. When the 
defender stops to go in another 
direction, the lineman plants his 
play-side foot and leads back out with the opposite foot. The defender 
works the offensive lineman from cone to cone. The defender should 
stay square to the cones and to the offensive lineman. This enables the 
blocker to read the defender’s numbers. The defender might turn slightly, 
but he should try to stay frontal as much as possible.
Coaching Points
The biggest challenge for the lineman will be shifting to the lead foot. The 
lineman may need to slow down until he gets the feel of leading with the 
near foot. He should step to the right with the right foot, shift his weight, 
and then step with the right foot again. If the lineman is moving to the right 
and the “rabbit” suddenly changes to move to the left, the lineman must 
step with his left foot to change directions. He must not step under his body 
with the right foot. Once the lineman has a feel for the drill, he should turn 
it loose and let go. Being efficient in the footwork—maintaining quick and 
active feet—is the most important element of the drill. The lineman must 
not get the shoulders leaning to the right when going right or to the left 
when going left. He should try to let his shoulders ride between his legs 
and should stay as controlled as possible without letting his body lean.
Figure 12.1  Shuffle mirror.

152
Push–Pull
Linemen can use this drill to find their center of gravity and balance. The 
lineman gets into his stance as in the shuffle mirror drill. He puts his right 
hand behind his back and grabs his left wrist. He gets into a great stag-
gered stance. He should stagger the foot back according to the side of the 
offensive line he plays on. 
The partner puts one hand 
on the lineman’s shoulder 
on the same side as the 
lineman’s back leg and puts 
his other hand behind the 
lineman’s neck (figure 12.2).
When the lineman gets in 
a great stance, he freezes 
in the stance. He should 
lock his core. When the 
partner pulls the lineman 
forward, the lineman posts 
forward and goes with the 
pull, taking two post steps 
forward but keeping good 
body position. When the 
partner pushes the lineman back, the lineman plants his feet and presses 
his shoulder against the pushing hand. The key to the drill is to be strong 
in the lower back and fight to stay in that locked-in stance. The drill starts 
when the partner pushes the lineman’s shoulder back. The blocker may 
have a tendency to let the shoulder turn—he must not do this! No matter 
what pressure is put on him, the lineman must work hard to keep his 
shoulders square and to maintain a great stance as much as possible.
Coaching Points
When the partner pushes on the lineman’s shoulder, the partner should 
release the pressure on the neck. When he pulls on the lineman’s neck, 
the partner should release the pressure on the shoulder. He should try 
to pull the lineman forward (not down on the neck), trying to yank the 
lineman out of his stance. When the partner pushes the lineman back-
ward, the partner should try to raise the lineman up and make him weak 
at that point of pressure. The partner needs to stand tall and help make 
this the best drill possible. Sometimes partners have a tendency to lie 
down and pull down on the offensive lineman. The drill has to be run by 
the defender. The coach should make sure the defender doesn’t get lazy 
and hurt the blocker. The defender has to stay tall.
Figure 12.2  Push–pull.

153
Pressure Hop
Pressure hop is a drill used to practice stopping a bull rusher. This drill is 
usually performed with two offensive players and two defensive players. 
First, the defensive player should be fitted into the chest of the offen-
sive blocker. The defender fits his hands into the blocker’s armpits and 
executes a drive block (figure 12.3). The offensive blocker is upright in his 
football stance with his hands on the outsides of the partner’s shoulders. 
He should have a slight 
bend in his knees. Once 
the defender starts to 
drive block the offensive 
lineman, the lineman 
holds the defender as 
long as possible and then 
executes a short hop 
backward with both feet. 
Once the offensive player 
hops back, he again tries 
to hold off the rusher as 
long as he can until he 
has to perform a short 
hop backward and reset 
again. The two players 
should do this for four 
or five hops and then stop. There should be a lot of straining going on 
during this drill. When taking the short hop backward, the lineman should 
execute a swap of the hips like when doing a power clean. He should 
drop his hips and reset.
The defensive partner starts with a drive block at three-fourths strength. 
Once both players are able to perform the drill well, the defensive partner 
comes at the offensive man at full speed.
Coaching Points
The offensive man needs to lean slightly forward with knees slightly 
bent. The defender should fit up with his face in the numbers, bow his 
neck, get his hands in the armpits, and maintain a flat back. He should 
then execute the drive block. The defender should apply pressure on the 
blocker at all times so he learns to stop the rusher, reset his hips, and 
be ready to stop him again. This drill is a great conditioning drill and will 
force the player to really strain.
Figure 12.3  Pressure hop.

154
Combination
The combination drill is a combination of the shuffle mirror, push–pull, 
and pressure hop drills. Together these drills simulate a situation that is 
similar to what the players will experience in a real game.
The offensive blocker gets into the perfect pass blocking stance. He 
should bend his knees, hold his shoulders over his knees, keep his elbows 
tight, and stagger his feet according to the side of the line he plays on. The 
defensive partner walks up to the offensive blocker and grabs his outside 
shoulder area. The offensive blocker puts his hands into the partner’s 
chest and presses. The defensive partner grabs the outside shoulder 
and pulls. There should be constant pressure on the offensive blocker’s 
hands. On the command “go,” the defensive partner will shuffle mirror, and 
the offensive blocker will press and shuffle. The offensive blocker must 
look at the defensive partner’s numbers on all moves. After the defensive 
partner shuffles, he may bull rush so the offensive blocker has to pressure 
hop. The defensive partner may also use a pull technique to simulate 
push–pull. The coach should make sure that the defender stays tall and 
doesn’t lean forward or lie down on the blocker. It is the defender’s job to 
help the blocker have the best drill possible.
Many possible combinations can be used. For example, the defender 
may execute any of these movements:
1.	 Shuffle right
2.	 Push, pull
3.	 Shuffle left
4.	 Shuffle right
5.	 Bull rush
6.	 Shuffle left
The defensive partner should mix up his movements and really work 
the offensive blocker hard.
Coaching Points
Let the offensive blocker get himself into the best offensive pass block-
ing stance possible before the defender approaches him. Once they are 
fitted together, the two players really need to keep a lot of pressure on 
each other. To do this, the defender pulls on the blocker, and the blocker 
pushes on the defender.

155
Punch
Timing the punch and maintaining balance are very important and very 
difficult to execute. During this drill, blockers will punch hand shields or 
shoulder pads on their partner.
Players start in two lines, and the coach calls out the command “Give 
me four out.” This means two pairs of players need to be out doing the 
drill. Two players are the blockers, and two players are the partners. On 
the command “go,” the partner comes at the blocker, and the blocker 
punches the hand shield when the partner is close. If the players are 
wearing shoulder pads, the partner should put his hands behind his back 
and then rush and take the punch. The blocker tries to maintain a great 
pass set and be ready to strike. He must not punch too quickly and get 
overextended. This can be an early issue. Another issue is punching too 
late and letting the defender get on top of the blocker. Each player should 
be aware of his arm length and just how quickly or slowly he should be 
punching the hand shield or shoulder pad.
When the blocker strikes the punch, he needs to give ground, reset, and 
be ready to strike again. Players should do this for four or five punches 
and then rotate.
Coaching Points
The biggest problem that 
players have in this drill is 
dropping their hands after 
striking a punch. Guards 
and centers must always 
carry their hands high and 
in a boxing strike position. 
Tackles must learn to strike 
with both hands from their 
belt buckles. Tackles may 
reset their hands to the point 
of the belt buckle as shown 
in figure 12.4.
As players perfect the 
drill, they should speed it up 
to get the rhythm of punch 
and reset. They should always keep their head up and keep big eyes on 
the target. They will not hit what they cannot see.
Figure 12.4  Resetting the hands to the belt 
buckle.

156
Sandbags
Sandbags are the perfect aid for helping linemen learn a great pass set. 
We do post, vertical, and kick sets while using sandbags as a teaching aid.
In two lines, players pair up behind two cones. On the command “go,” 
two players jump out with the sandbags in their hands, ready to execute 
the drill. On the command “set hit,” the centers take off together in one 
direction and perform a kick slide (figure 12.5a). They punch the sandbag 
forward each time the lead foot hits the ground. They repeat this step and 
punch for five or six steps at an angle of their kick slide step. The kick 
slide is the only set the centers use; they never use a post set. Guards 
and tackles use the post set (figure 12.5b).
The guards and tackles will be back to back when executing the post 
set. On the post set, they should post into the line of scrimmage with a 
punch and replace. They should execute the post steps five or six times 
down the line of scrimmage.
On the second set, the centers kick slide to their left. Again, they are 
lined up behind each other so they can go in the same direction. The 
guards and tackles kick slide in the appropriate direction according to 
which side they play on. Usually on Wednesdays, we have the tackles and 
guards perform the vertical set. The tackles and guards do the kick slide 
and hold off the post set. When using the vertical pass set, the tackles set 
back three or four steps. The guards set back two or three steps. Once 
again, the linemen should punch when the lead foot hits the ground.
Figure 12.5  Sandbags: (a) centers; (b) guards and tackles.
a
b

157
When the offensive linemen take their regular pass set stance, they 
should be holding the sandbags. They should keep elbows tight and 
arms at a 30- to 40-degree angle. When the offensive blocker performs 
the kick step or post step, he should punch the sandbag with that first 
step. For example, if the blocker kick slides to the left, he should punch 
the sandbag every time the left foot leads out and hits the ground.
Once the step is taken and the sandbag is extended, the lineman should 
make sure the arm is not extended over 80 degrees and never closer 
than 30 degrees. This will ensure a tight, short, and powerful punch. It 
will also help the lineman maintain balance and body control.
Coaching Points
The coach may have to stay in front of the blocker and hold his hand 
out as a target for the blocker to punch the sandbag to. This sometimes 
helps the blocker find the rhythm needed to do this drill. Regarding arm 
angles, players should be more open than closed. Most players will hold 
the bag next to their chest. Once the drill starts, the players should hold 
the bag out away from their body with an arm angle of 30 to 40 degrees.

158
Tap
Offensive linemen need to get the feel of the defender putting his arms 
around their body and still be able to time the punch. Players should do this 
drill in shoulder pads. The partner comes at the blocker, and the blocker is 
set in a great pass set, waiting to punch (figure 12.6). The partner needs 
to get close enough to reach up with both hands and tap the outside tip 
of the blocker’s shoulder pads. The partner will still take the punch from 
the offensive blocker. The partner then drops his hand and gets ready to 
reach up again and retap the blocker. Players should perform four or five 
repetitions. The offensive blocker punches and resets to strike another 
punch. When the blocker feels the arms of the defender coming to grab 
him, he learns how to time the punch. If the defender is close enough to 
grab the blocker, the defender is usually close enough to punch.
Coaching Points
Make sure the defender does not get too fast with his hands and just tap, 
tap, tap. He needs to slow down and make sure the blocker is ready to 
punch. Each tap is an individual drill in itself.

Pass Progression and Drills  159
Summary
This concludes the seven-step progression of pass protection drills. 
Offensive linemen should do these drills at least twice a week during the 
season and every day during football camp in three- or four-part phases. 
The progressions discussed will help each player become an effective 
pass blocker. The drills also allow the blocker to work on any weak parts 
of his pass blocking. At times, the shuffle mirror, sandbags, punch, and 
tap drills may be the only drills used. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss 
conditioning and core work. These are two aspects that play a key part 
in the success of an offensive lineman.

This page intentionally left blank.

161
13
Conditioning 
and Core Work
Conditioning is one of the main factors in a lineman’s ability 
to become a great player. Conditioning comes from distance and sprint 
running. The best players are always in the best condition. Being in great 
condition allows the player to perform at the top of his game and to go 
full speed on every repetition.
A great core and a very strong back allow the player to create power 
and torque when performing. Body appearance (with a great core) and 
good health are additional reasons for wanting to be in top shape.
Linemen should run year-round to maintain their weight. Once a large 
person gets heavy, it is very difficult to get the weight off. Linemen need 
to be able to run long distances as well as the 110-yard distance.

162  Complete Offensive Line
Five Fifths
The lineman runs five fifths of a mile around the football field in a time of 
80 seconds a fifth. After each fifth, the lineman gets a 45-second break 
before he runs the next fifth. This is repeated until all five fifths are com-
pleted. Once the lineman can run five fifths in 80 seconds, his next goal 
is to drop the time down to 75 seconds, then 70 seconds. Once he can 
run five fifths in 65 seconds or less, he will be in great shape.
To set up this drill, use eight cones to mark the course on the football 
field. Set four cones on the 5-yard lines where they connect with the 
sidelines. Place the other four cones 5 yards in on the goal line to create 
a perfect curve. This distance will measure out to be a fifth of a mile. Front 
starting point after one lap is made from start to finish at the same point. 
After running five of these, the player will have completed a mile.
110s
The 110s are run in 18 seconds with a 45-second break between each 
run. The player repeats this until he has completed 15 110-yard runs. 
During the summer, players should overtrain on these by building up to 30 
sets of 110s about three-quarters of the way through summer workouts. 
Then, when they go back to running only 15 110s, it will seem effortless.
The drill starts on the line at the back of the end zone and ends on 
the opposite goal line. After crossing the goal line, the player strides out, 
turns around, and gets ready to start from the back of the end zone on 
that end of the field.
Core Stability
Core stability should be a primary area of focus year-round. The first 
step is to identify the core and the targeted areas. The human core con-
sists of the abdominal muscles, the right and left obliques, and the mid 
to lower back. Just as every lineman is different in the way he runs or 
blocks, each lineman’s core strength will separate him as an athlete and 
in his ability to dominate on the field. A strong and stable core will allow 
a lineman to be more mobile with his steps because of the balance and 
stability he will gain. Core stability also allows the lineman to execute 
more powerful blocks because the core support helps him deliver each 
shock during play.

Front Plank
Lie on your abdomen. Cup your hands to make a pyramid with your 
elbows underneath your chest. Your legs and feet are together. Rise up 
on your toes and lift your body off the ground (figure 13.1). Keep your 
head down to ensure a flat back. Hold for 90 seconds, then lower to the 
ground. Complete two or three repetitions.

Plate V-Up
Lie on your back with your legs straight out and feet together. Hold a 
25-pound weight plate in both hands with arms extended straight up 
from your chest in front of your face (figure 13.2a). Raise your legs and 
lift your shoulders off the ground, touching the weight plate to your feet 
as your body forms a V (figure 13.2b). Do not let the weight generate any 
momentum. Remember, you want to have a strong core and then use it. 
Do two sets of 25 repetitions.

Lie on your back with your hands behind your head. Lift both legs off the 
ground with one leg straight and the other leg bent. Bring the opposite 
elbow toward the bent knee (figure 13.3a). Rotate your legs and elbows, 
bringing the other knee up toward the opposite elbow (figure 13.3b). You 
can either time the exercise and perform two sets of 45 seconds each 
or count the number of times the elbow moves toward the knee (right 
elbow to left knee and left elbow to right knee equals one repetition) and 
perform two sets of 18 repetitions.

Lie flat on your back. Hold a stability ball between your legs (figure 13.4a). 
Lift your legs slightly off the ground and your arms straight above your 
head slightly off the ground. Lift your legs to bring the ball to meet your 
hands in the middle (like a V). Grab the ball with your hands (figure 13.4b) 
and return to the start position (figure 13.4c). Return the ball to your legs 
by lifting your hands and grabbing the ball with your legs. One round trip 
(ball from legs to hands and from hands to legs) is one repetition. Perform 
two sets of 15 repetitions.

Entire Core 
Hanging Knee Raise
This exercise not only builds core strength, but also improves grip strength, 
shoulder strength, and mental toughness. You will need a squat rack. 
Chalk up your hands to help keep your grip. Hang from the top of the 
rack so your feet do not touch the ground (figure 13.5a). Keep your toes 
flexed and your feet out in front to avoid swinging between repetitions. 
Bring your knees up toward your chest (figure 13.5b) and pause for a 
two count. Extend your legs, keeping your feet off the ground. Perform 
two sets of 20 repetitions.
Figure 13.5  Hanging knee raise: (a) starting position; (b) lifting knees toward chest.
For a more advanced version, keep the legs straight, lifting your straight 
legs up past your belly button.
To develop mental toughness and core stability, hang with your knees 
or legs up for 1 minute.

Side Plank
Get into the up position described for a front plank (page 163). Rotate to 
the right side so your bent right arm is on the ground aligned with your 
chest but your hand is in front of your chest. Place your left arm on your 
left hip (figure 13.6a). Your left leg will be stacked on top of your right leg. 
Keep your body straight and keep your right hip off the ground for 90 
seconds. Return to the front plank position and repeat, rotating to the left 
side (figure 13.6b). Perform two or three sets on each side.

Resisted Side Bend
Grab a 45-pound weight plate. Stand 
with your feet on the ground and the 
45-pound plate in one hand. Place 
your free hand on your hip. Keep-
ing your legs straight, bend to the 
weighted side (figure 13.7). Remem-
ber not to bend your legs when bend-
ing to the weighted side because 
this will cause you to push off the 
legs instead of pulling with the free 
oblique. Return to the start position 
and repeat to the same side. After 10 
repetitions, switch sides. Perform two 
sets of 10 repetitions on each side.

Bench Oblique Rise
You will need a partner for this exercise. Lie down on your right hip on a 
flat bench so your upper torso hangs off the bench (figure 13.8a). Your 
partner braces your legs. Cross your hands over your chest and let your 
head and shoulders hang toward the ground. Extend up (figure 13.8b). 
Squeeze at the top position for a two count and then control yourself as 
you return to the start position. Perform 10 repetitions on your right side 
and then switch sides. Perform two sets of 10 repetitions on each side.

Barbell Russian Twist
Stand, holding a barbell that is end over end. Grab the top of the barbell. 
Slightly bend your knees and keep your arms straight and locked out. 
Rotate from side to side (figure 13.9), lowering the barbell as far as pos-
sible while keeping the arms locked out. If the arms start to bend, you are 
going too low and defeating the purpose of the exercise. Lowering the 
barbell to the right and then to the left equals one repetition. Complete 
two sets of 20 repetitions.

Stability Ball Hip Thrust
Get into a side plank position with a stability ball between your legs and 
with your hip off the ground. Thrust your hip up for a two count (figure 
13.10) and then return to plank position, keeping your hip off the ground. 
This exercise also develops the groin muscles because of the pressure 
applied to the stability ball. Perform 12 repetitions, then switch sides. 
Perform two sets of 12 repetitions on each side.

Superman
Lie facedown on the ground with your arms straight out in front of you 
and with your legs straight (figure 13.11a). Lift your arms and legs off the 
floor (figure 13.11b). Hold this position for a two count and then release. 
Perform two sets of 20 repetitions.
For a more advanced version, perform this exercise on a stability ball.

Back Extension
If you have access to a glute-ham machine, use it. If not, use a stability 
ball or flat bench. Get in position in the glute-ham machine with your nose 
level with the bottom T bar (figure 13.12a). Your legs are straight, and your 
hips are on the roller. Extend up (figure 13.12b) and hold the position for 
a two count when you are parallel to the floor. Your back should be flat. 
Perform two sets of 15 repetitions.

Bird Dog Pole
Get down on all fours, with your knees and hands flat. Your head should 
be flat, eyes looking to the ground. Have a coach or partner place a PVC 
pipe between your shoulder blades so it is in line with your rear end. The 
pipe will measure your stability and balance while you are flexed in an 
uncomfortable position. Once the PVC pipe is placed, lift your right arm 
and left leg (figure 13.14a), pushing each limb straight back. If your limbs 
drift or the PVC pipe falls, there is a flaw in your exercise technique. Point 
with the extended arm and flex the toe of the extended foot. Hold for a 
two count, return to start position, and switch sides, lifting the left arm and 
right leg (figure 13.14b). Perform two sets of 20 repetitions on each side.

Alternate Lying Bird Dog
Get in a superman position—facedown on the ground, arms straight out 
in front of you, and legs straight. Raise your right arm and left leg (figure 
13.15a), lifting your thigh off the ground. Hold for a two count. Return to the 
start position and repeat with your left arm and right leg (figure 13.15b). 
Perform two sets of 20 repetitions on each side.

Lying Leg Crossover
Get in a superman position—facedown on the ground, legs straight—
except place your arms flat to the sides, elbows bent. Your goal is to try 
to take the left foot to the right side (figure 13.16a) and take the right 
foot to the left side (figure 13.16b) by crossing your leg over your body. 
Complete as many repetitions as possible in 1 minute. Complete one set.

Balance Ball
This is a total core exercise that also builds a strong groin and improves 
balance. Grab a stability ball. If you are a beginner, start against a wall 
or another firm object that you can 
brace yourself on until you are able 
to balance on your own. Place both 
knees on the stability ball. Find your 
balance with your hips extended and 
your back straight. Squeeze the ball 
with your knees to help keep your 
body stable and balanced. Place your 
hands on your head (figure 13.17). 
Hold this position for 1 minute. Per-
form two sets.
For a more advanced version, have 
your coach or a partner lightly tap 
your abdomen, elbows, or other parts 
of your body to test your balance. Or 
toss a light medicine ball to a partner. 
When you become truly advanced, 
you can progress from the knee 
position to a standing position on the 
stability ball.

Summary
The core is the most important muscle group in the body because all 
power and force are generated through the core area. A player with a 
strong core and a strong back will be a much stronger football player.
Offensive linemen should remember core flexibility in every exercise 
they do. Bodybuilders condition their muscles for performance by con-
stantly flexing between sets to build muscle endurance. The same concept 
applies to core endurance in football: The more the player’s core endures, 
the easier it is to build on.
This book began with instructions for the offensive lineman on the 
proper way to get in a stance and make all the run blocks that a lineman 
needs to make. We have covered all phases of pass protection and the 
drills to help linemen learn pass protection. Drills for practicing pass 
protection, blitzes, and twist games were also covered. In addition, we’ve 
discussed conditioning for linemen as well as core stabilization.
If a player wants to become a great offensive lineman, he needs to be 
the guy who outworks everyone! Hard work and sweat are the way to 
become a really good offensive lineman. If a player also has some skill 
and natural talent, he can become great!
