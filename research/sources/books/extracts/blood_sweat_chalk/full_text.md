THE MODERN game of football is
filled with plays and formations with
names like the Counter Trey, the
Wildcat, the Zone Blitz and the Cover
Two. They have become part of the
sport's vernacular, and yet for many
fans they remain just names, often
confusing ones. To rectify that, Tim
Layden has drilled deep into the core
of the game to reveal not only how
these chalkboard X's and O's really
work on the field, but also where they
came from and who dreamed them up.
These playbook schemes, many of
them iUuminated by diagrams, bear
the insignia of some of the game's great
innovators, men like Vince Lombardi,
Don Coryell, Tom Osborne, Bill Walsh,
Tony Dungy and Buddy Ryan. But
football has also been radically altered
by the ingenious work ofmen with
more obscure names, like Tiger Ellison,
Emory Bellard and Mouse Davis.
In Blood, Sweat and Chalk, Layden
takes readers into the meeting rooms—
and in some cases the living rooms—
where the game's most significant
ideas were hatched. He goes to the
coaches and to the players who
inspired them, and lets them tell their
stories. In candid conversations with
some of football's most intriguing
characters, Layden provides a
fascinating guide to the game, helping
fans to better see the subtleties of
America's favorite sport.

"Aww, hell, that's the great thing aboutfootball
coaches. They'll kick your ass on Saturday
afternoon and then tellyou how they did it"
—Barry Switzer

PROLOGUE
N THE
fall of 1997
I spent a
week with the Michigan State
football team. The coach of the
Spartans at the time was Nick
Saban, who would later go on to LSU, the Miami Dolphins and Alabama.
I spent more time in meeting rooms that week than in any week of my
life, watching film with Saban and his coaching staff. Aside from being
fodder for a story in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED—and despite the fact that
the Spartans would lose that weekend to eventual national champion
Michigan—my week in East Lansing opened a window, allowing me to
see into the work that goes into planning every snap in a football game,
work that's extraordinary in both its volume and detail. Saban's days be-
gan in predawn darkness and ended late at night, an effort that foretold
championships that would come later at LSU and Alabama. Saban treated
every second of videotape as if it might unlock an opponent.
I'd been in meetings before. I'd spent a week at Tennessee with Peyton
Manning in 1995, when he was a sophomore, and doubled my previous
football knowledge in those seven days. But my week at Michigan State
was the first time I had watched an entire staff conceive on paper what
they expected to take place on the field. This is what coaches do. Their
work is equal parts science and art—the science of outmaneuvering an
opponent like a military field commander and the art of understanding
the subtleties of players'
abilities. Just because you diagram a 24-yard
comeback pass to the wide side of the field, that doesn't mean your quar-
terback can complete it.
In the business of coaching, the word "genius" is tossed around casu-
ally. I have used it myself over the years, and more often than I care to
remember. Yet whether or not there are true football geniuses, there is,
9

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
no doubt, plenty of genius in football. In researching this book, I saw it at
work many times. I also found that there are a few key principles that help
define the way football is coached and played.
•Almost no coach will lay claim to inventing anything. Early in my report-
ing I had a long conversation with Joe Gibbs, who guided the Washington
Redskins to three Super Bowl titles and is regarded as one of the most gift-
ed strategists of modern football. During the interview I twice tried to credit
Gibbs with being the "first coach" to run a particular scheme. Both times
Gibbs stopped me in my tracks. "You'll never hear me say I was the first to
do anything," he said, "because there's a pretty good chance somebody did
it before me, but nobody knows about it."
• Occasionally an offense or defense is created out of pure inspirational
lightning. But usually not. Most of the time, change grows from weakness
or desperation. In 1968, Darrell Royal at Texas was "fixin' to get fired,"
as they say in Austin, when he let his assistant Emory Bellard install the
wishbone (Chapter 4). Fearful opportunism is evident in almost every in-
novation in the game's history.
• Stealing is an integral, and acceptable, part of the game. If a team does
something with success, other teams will copy it. Guaranteed.
• Chalk work is all about concepts. But the game isn't played by concepts;
it's played by human athletes. Boomer Esiason was a smart quarterback
who executed Sam Wyche's no-huddle offense (Chapter 21) with preci-
sion. But when Wyche tried the same offense in Tampa with other quar-
terbacks, things didn't go so well. An often repeated locker room scenario
looks something like this: A coach diagrams a system with X's and O's
that shows how it works, let's say a seven-step drop-back pass to complete
a post pattern to a wideout. But at the end of his spiel, the coach circles
one of the defensive X's and says, "This play should work, but if that X is
Dick Butkus, it's a different story. Dick Butkus is too good an X."
ON A cold, foggy morning at Duke University, an hour before sunrise on
an early spring weekday in 2008, dormitory windows are dark, office
parking lots are empty. In the southwest corner of the campus, adjacent
to iconic Cameron Indoor Stadium, shadowy figures begin to appear in
the courtyard outside the Yoh Football Center. They shuffle into view like
zombies from the mist, wearing blue hoodies and fleece jackets, hands
10

PROLOGUE
stuffed deep into their pockets, heads dropped low as if they're still beat-
ing back exhaustion. Football players start work early.
In a fourth-floor conference room inside the Yoh, quarterbacks convene
with Duke offensive coordinator Kurt Roper. The lights are dimmed, but
there is no possibility of surreptitious sleep, because Roper, the 35-year-
old son of a football coach, plunges into his work with relentless energy.
He narrates the day's lesson while using a laser pointer on a video screen
and peppers the QBs with terms from the Duke offense. Shack package;
500 protection; shallow cross. Roper punctuates his every explanation with
the phrase, "Does that make sense?" But it's really not a question, and he
doesn't wait for an answer. Because it damn well better make sense to the
three quarterbacks sitting at the table.
It is the 10th day of spring practice for Duke in preparation for the
opening of the 2008 season in five months. The Blue Devils program is
starting over—and not for the first time—after winning just four out of
46 games in the previous four years under coach Ted Roof. In Decem-
ber 2007 Duke hired former Mississippi coach David Cutcliffe. Coaches
generally grow from one side of the football or the other; Cutcliffe is an
offense guy, having guided the college careers of both Peyton Manning
(while the offensive coordinator at Tennessee) and Eli Manning (while
the head coach at Mississippi). He can recite pass protections the way an
actuary can reel off mortality rates. His friends all call him Cut, which is
easy enough to remember.
Cutcliffe was raised in Birmingham, and he has never left what could
loosely be called the Football South. He coached at his high school alma
mater, at Tennessee and at Ole Miss. And now, Duke. The 53-year-old
Cutcliffe speaks in a baritone that has deepened with age and employs the
kind of metaphors that younger coaches seldom use.
Like this one, to describe his offense: "My first year at Tennessee as an
assistant coach in 1982, the offensive coordinator was [future NFL coach]
Al Saunders," says Cut. "He brought some West Coast offense with him.
When Al left, Walt Harris came in and we dipped that offense in the Ten-
nessee River and got some of that Pacific Ocean saltwater off it. And we
became pretty dominant. Then we went to Mississippi, and we dunked
that offense into the Mississippi River. Now we're in North Carolina, just
a couple hours from the Atlantic Ocean, and back to the saltwater."
11

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
That's a colorful way of expressing what is true of almost every offense
(and defense): It is the product of everyone who has touched it.
This book is about the language and the complexity of football. It is
about the game that is planned long before it is played, about those hours
spent by coaches in darkened rooms conjuring novel schemes to deploy
11 people on a field. It is about a game contested in the mind, about being
smarter than the guy wearing the headset on the other side of the field.
On this day in North Carolina, Cutcliffe and his offensive staff are en-
gaged in the process of "installation," the means by which a system is taught
to players. Before the start of spring practice Duke players are given two
binders. One is the playbook. The other is the "install book," which is broken
down by calendar days, with a detailed description of which schemes and
plays will be installed on each day, long before the season starts. "The play-
book at first is pretty general," says Cutcliffe. "The install book"— Cutcliffe
puts his emphasis on the first syllable—"has more specifics to everything
they might see in a particular play. Fewer plays, more details."
The install book teaches the language and method of the game, the
tools players will use to play football with their brains. One of Roper's
fundamental jobs is teaching the new offense to the quarterbacks.
"Learning a new offense is like learning a new language," says Roper.
"The players understand football, and they understand plays. But it's like
they're thinking in English, and we're teaching them in a foreign lan-
guage. At this point we tell them something and they translate it back to
the other language. Our job is to get them to think in our language."
At this stage, juniors Thaddeus Lewis and Zack Asack are competing
for the starting QB position. After practice that day, Lewis describes a
play from the Cutcliffe system, freshly dipped in the Atlantic Ocean: Flip
Right Don 668 B Shack. It's a play designed to work against a quick blitz
and get the ball to the tight end on a short drag route. Lewis is asked to
recall what a similar play would have been called a year earlier under the
previous staff. He pauses and rubs his chin. "You know what?" he says.
"They make you forget it."
Half an hour later Cutcliffe is back in his office. It's a long way from four
wins in four seasons to anything resembling success. There are photos of
both Manning brothers on Cutcliffe's office wall, a reminder of where he
has been and also of the distance left to travel now. "This team is pretty
12

PROLOGUE
long on want-to at this point," Cutcliffe is saying to a couple of friends in
town from Knoxville. "But we're a little short on know-how."
(They will get better: With Lewis throwing for more than 5,500 yards
over two seasons, the Blue Devils will win a total of nine games in 2008
and 2009.)
Like any coach, Cutcliffe draws upon the methods and terminology of
an earlier era. In coaching parlance the term cut-ups is used to describe
pieces of video arranged to address a particular aspect of the game—red
zone offense, third-and-long defense, or any other scenario. When game
film was actually film, cut-ups were made by cutting the film with scis-
sors (thus the name) and splicing together the sections needed for study.
Cutcliffe has been coaching long enough that in his early years he actually
cut up film. "You had to remember, 'Shiny side up, shiny side up,' " he
says. "Because if you didn't, it would come out backward, and you'd have
a lefthanded quarterback and a lot of other problems."
He asks about the book, and what systems will be covered. Names are
exchanged: West Coast offense, zone blitz, wishbone and many others.
From a small notepad of Duke football stationery, he snatches three pages
and begins drawing up zone blitzes, having seized on that scheme. He
scribbles furiously, narrating. This is something all coaches are inclined
to do. Then he stops suddenly. "You know what?" he says in that deep
voice, straight out of Birmingham. "Here's what a system does: It tries to
put players in a position to succeed. That's what it is."
SINCE MODERN football first began taking shape not long after the turn
of the 20th century, hundreds of offenses and defenses have been tried.
Fourteen of them, some with variations, are examined in this book. It's
not a comprehensive selection but a representative one, exalting those
systems that have either endured or profoundly impacted the game. Be-
yond the X's and O's, though, these pages tell the stories of the men who
held the chalk.
It all starts—as does nearly everything in football—with Pop Warner.
13

A-9—THE SPIN
From Glenn Scobey (Pop) Warners 1908 single wingplaybook, thisplay
is a classic combo ofpoweranddeception. From an "Aformation"with an
unbalancedline (two tackles on the right side), the ball is snapped to the "up"
back (FB), who then spins clockwise afull360 degrees,faking the handoffto
the tailback, who carries out hisfake aroundright end. The outside tacklepulls
to the right, enticing the defensive lineman to charge into the backfield, where
he is blockedby the "quarterback" (essentially a blocking back in the single
wing). The leftguardpulls to the right andruns through the hole vacatedby
thepulling tackle, then seals offthe middle linebacker. The rightguardand
inside tackle execute a double-team block on the defensive tackle. After executing
his spinfake, thefullbackfollows thepullingguardthrough the hole.

THE SINGLE
WING
It's more than 100 years old, the offense of Pop Warner, but
it's still out on the field today—you can ask Bill Belichick
Apopka, Fla. ? doing what America does every Sunday afternoon in the
fall: watching the NFL on television. Right there on Jeremy's screen, the
Miami Dolphins dismantled the New England Patriots 38-13, ending the
Patriots' 21-game regular-season winning streak. Six times during the
game the Dolphins lined up with running back Ronnie Brown in the posi-
tion normally occupied by a shotgun quarterback. Brown ran, passed and
handed off to fellow running back Ricky Williams. The Patriots played as
if they had never seen such football, and in fact, most of them had not.
But Jeremy Gallon had.
Eighteen months earlier, just before the start of spring football practice
at Apopka High, a large suburban school 15 miles northwest of Orlando,
head coach Rick Darlington had laid out the offense that the Blue Darters
would be running in the coming season. There would be no quarterback.
There would be a running back who would receive shotgun snaps and
just take off with the ball. Another running back would be lined up right
next to him, and sometimes he would get the snap. There would be end-
less play-fakes and many different ballcarriers, but few passes. It was like

nothing any of the Apopka players had ever seen before. "I didn't get it,"
recalls Gallon, who would be inserted into the starting backfield and re-
ceive most of the center snaps. "I didn't get it at all. It was just weird."
Darlington is a football coach to his bones. If you cut into him with
a sharp knife, you'd hit a thick layer of pigskin. His first job was work-
ing with the Lakeland (Fla.) High junior varsity team when he was still
in high school, and he has coached every autumn since. He won the
Florida 6A (largest) state title at Apopka in 2001, later coached three
years at perennial national power Valdosta High in southern Georgia,
then returned to Apopka in '06. Darlington's teams have run offenses
ranging from the triple option to the shotgun spread passing game. Yet
here in the spring of '07, at the age of 43, he found himself without the
type of accurate passer who would play quarterback in most systems.
What he did have was a bunch of very good running backs, like Gallon.
So Darlington decided to dig up a dinosaur.
The coach told his players they were climbing into a time machine;
the offense he was giving them was called the single wing, and its roots
were at least a century deep, reaching all the way back to the legend-
ary Glenn Scobey (Pop) Warner. The great Jim Thorpe had once played
the same position for Warner at the Carlisle Indian School in 1911 and
'12 that Gallon would play for Apopka: single wing "tailback." Darling-
ton showed films of teams running the single wing. "He showed us
guys wearing leather helmets," says Gallon.
("It was some old
stuff,"
admits Darlington, "but I don't know about leather helmets. They prob-
ably looked like leather helmets to these kids.") On most plays the ball
was snapped, shotgun- style, to a tailback. Multiple fakes and complex
line blocking ensued. It looked nothing like the football the young Blue
Darters of Apopka had seen—or played. But in the 2007 season Apopka
went 12-2 running the single wing, averaged nearly 40 points a game
and reached the Florida 6A semifinals before losing. Gallon rushed for
more than 1,600 yards. Coach Darlington and his Blue Darters stayed
with their new-old offense the following season.
It is a Friday night in November 2008. The Blue Darters enter a
game against West Orange with a 7-2 record and bound for the state
playoffs. Apopka's squad has breathtakingly fast, young athletes. They
wear the best in modern football equipment and are supported by a pre-
16

THE SINGLE WING
cision squad of cheerleaders and a massive marching band. It is 2008
by every measure. Yet at the moment Apopka's offense cranks up, it is
as if the team is performing an ancient football ritual: Nearly every play
includes a direct snap to a tailback who runs or sprints out and passes.
In combination with Apopka's speed, the single wing is lethal. The
Blue Darters win 49-7, and after the game Darlington is surrounded by
his wife, Shelly, and the couple's seven children. "You don't see anybody
unhappy about running an old leather-helmet offense out here," says Dar-
lington, surveying the celebration. "You look at this offense, it gives so
many kids a chance to run the ball. It was hard for a lot of the kids at first,
but now we've got our whole feeder program running
it. Our freshman
team is undefeated."
The Blue Darters are not alone in their discovery. On the following
Saturday afternoon, 1,000 miles to the north, in Windsor Locks, Conn.,
the high school team of Housatonic-Wamogo takes the field as a cold rain
falls from low, dark clouds.
It is a decidedly more spartan atmosphere
than that of the previous night in central Florida, yet the methods—and
outcome—are very much the same. Housatonic-Wamogo rolls to an easy
victory on the shoulders of the old single wing.
Early in the game on a slow, muddy field, sophomore tailback Tanner
Brissett takes a direct snap, fakes to senior Will Kennedy as Kennedy runs
into the middle of the line. Almost simultaneously, senior Sam Schwartz
scoots past from his wingback position as if running a reverse around
the left edge. Brissett fakes to him as well, then turns back to the line of
scrimmage and runs off tackle, untouched, 70 yards for a touchdown.
"The defense can't figure out who has the ball," says Kennedy. "There
have been times when I've run straight into the line with the ball and the
whole defense is running away from me to tackle somebody who doesn't
even have the ball."
The coach at Housatonic-Wamogo (a cooperative of two high schools,
serving seven small towns in the northwest corner of Connecticut)
is
44-year-old Deron Bayer. When he was hired as an assistant in 1997 to
help coach a program that annually dresses fewer than 35 players, he
promptly logged into his school's fledgling Internet system in search of
an offense that might work with so few athletes. "The search engine was
Hotbot, that's how long ago it was," says Bayer. His search led him to the
17

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
single wing and eventually to a conclave of single wing coaches in 2001.
There were 11 in attendance; at the conclusion they took a group photo
posed in an unbalanced-right single wing formation, straight from Pop
Warner's playbook. Bayer installed his offense two years ago and, like
Darlington, showed his players vintage films. "We watched video tapes,"
says running back Kennedy, "but in the audio you could hear a film pro-
jector whirring in the background."
It was the sound of time standing still.
The single wing, hatched more than 100 years ago, is experiencing a
rebirth on every level from youth and high school football to the NFL,
where during the 2008 season at least seven teams used some variation of
the old-school package, all the while calling it the Wildcat. College football
is on board as well. The University of Florida offense that '07 Heisman
Trophy winner Tim Tebow operated for head coach Urban Meyer is, in
the words of Patriots coach and football history aficionado Bill Belichick,
"the perfect blend of single wing running and spread passing. Call it what
you want, but
it's single wing football." And simply by speaking those
words—"single wing"—Belichick dismisses a taboo. Modern coaches have
long concocted aliases for the old offense, like quarterback run game, to
avoid a name that might make them seem out of touch. In fact, they are
on the cutting edge.
Brewster, Mass.
November 2008
THE SINGLE wing's serpentine road through the 20th century and
into the 21st is clearly viewed from an 800-square-foot office above the
garage of Ed Racely's stately home on a waterfront bluff in Brewster,
Mass., on the inside elbow of Cape Cod. Racely, born in 1928, worked
a long and profitable career as the co-owner of a road-building busi-
ness in Northern California, but long before that, as a young boy in
Walthill, Neb., he had a passion for the history and traditions of foot-
ball. He wrote letters to famous football coaches like Wallace Wade
at Duke and Gen. Robert Neyland at Tennessee, requesting copies
of game programs. Through high school, college (University of Ne-
braska), the Marines, seven years working back home in the family
18

THE SINGLE WING
businesses, graduate school (USC) and his
entire business
career,
Racely kept indulging his football hobby, gathering the game's arcana
wherever he could find
it, with a particular emphasis on the single
wing offense.
The result is a sprawling treasure trove of football history that fills the
office—and this doesn't include the nearby storage shed that houses even
more material. Racely owns thousands of DVDs, VHS tapes and even
16-millimeter films,
all documenting the evolution of the single wing.
He has cabinets full of playbooks and personal correspondence from the
likes of legendary turn-of-the-century coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. There
are eight windows in the office looking out on a beautiful New England
world, but there is a mighty temptation to simply sit instead in front of
the 48-inch flat screen, with Racely's corded coach's remote in hand, and
let history unfold.
Racely is the go -to guy on single wing history, the unpretentious, unof-
ficial curator who speaks of football's past with pride and sincerity, as if
he had been there on the turf with the men he has researched. If you make
a phone call or send an e-mail to any of the many coaches who have ad-
opted the single wing in some form, you will almost always hear in return,
Have you talked to Ed Racely?
"People ask me
all the time who
started the
single wing,"
says
Racely. "I tell them
it was President Theodore Roosevelt." The line is
delivered as
if it's a joke, but a visitor is unsure whether to laugh or
not because Racely's one-liner is based on a popular mythology: that
early in the 20th century Roosevelt intervened in football when he felt
the game had become too violent, and that he changed the rules. This
much is generally accurate: In 1905 Roosevelt was a participant in a
process that pushed college football toward rules changes designed to
make the game safer, outlawing dangerous mass-momentum, closed-
formation plays like the flying wedge. These rules changes gave rise to
the game of modern football, including the forward pass and the single
wing. As for Roosevelt's fanhood, author John Sayle Watterson, in his
exhaustive history of college football published in 2000, writes, "De-
spite Roosevelt's concern about brutality and unsportsmanlike play,
he came to believe that the growing public clamor against football had
gone too
far. He had always favored a middle-of-the-road approach,
19

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
and football was no exception." Meaning that if someone tells you that
Teddy Roosevelt tried to outlaw football—a not uncommon claim—you
can tell him that he's wrong.
POP WARNER has been immortalized as the namesake of football's most
well-known youth organization. Long before he became a brand name,
Glenn Scobey Warner was one of two coaches—the other was Stagg—who
built the foundation of the modern game. Warner had been a two-way
guard at Cornell from 1892 to '94; a year after his graduation, at the age of
24, he was the head coach at the University of Georgia. From 1897 to 1914
Warner coached, in two stints each, at his alma mater, Cornell, and at the
Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania; during this time, most football
historians agree, Warner created the single wing offense.
In 1908 Warner wrote and distributed a correspondence course for
coaches; copies of the course quickly sold out. In '12 and '27 Warner
wrote expansive books outlining his football philosophies in terms that
would influence the game for nearly half a century. In the preface to the
taut, 205-page 1927 edition, Warner began, "In 1908 I published a corre-
spondence course for football coaches and players. At that time the game
was in the process of being revamped from the old push-and-pull, close-
formation game into the more open game of today.
.
.
."
If modern fans were to watch Warner's early-20th-century teams,
they would find his description perplexing; the game would look primi-
tive. But the single wing was, in fact, a far more open and complex sys-
tem than football had previously seen. In his book Warner earmarks
the likely creation date for the single wing. Under the chapter head-
ing "Formation A," Warner wrote, "This offensive formation has often
been referred to as the 'Carlisle formation,' because it was first used by
the Indians. ... I have used this formation or variations of it ever since
pushing and pulling the runner was prohibited in 1906." The birth date
of the single wing has been frequently debated (Racely wonders if Stagg
might have tinkered with it first), but Warner's writing strongly suggests
it was born in '06 at Carlisle.
His 1927 book includes diagrams of the Carlisle formation that clear-
ly show what came to be known as the single wing: An unbalanced line
(a guard, two tackles and an end on one side; a guard and an end on the
20

other); a tailback lined up in a shotgun position, and next to him a full-
back; at the line of scrimmage behind the guard, a blocking back; and
outside the strongside end, a single wingback, later to be the source of
the formation's name. Warner's explanation for the creation of Forma-
tion A is a marvel of utilitarian economy, both in concept and descrip-
tion. It encapsulates the birth of modern football, yet Warner makes its
invention seem obvious.
Before [1906]
it was customary to mass the backs behind the line and
even bring one or two heavy linemen back, so as to be able to hurl a mass
of men at any spot in the defensive line. The idea was to get behind the
man with the ball and shove and jam him through the line, or let him
jump in the air feet first while the other men shoved him over the line
and helped him by dragging him along
When the rules changed to prevent pushing the runner, there was no
more reason for the backs being massed. Those behind the runner were
of no use, and in line-bucking plays only two men, the ballcarrier and a
man to precede him or lead him through the hole, were needed.
THE SINGLE wing relied on
slick backfield
ball handling (including
360-degree spins and fakes by the backs) and precise pulling and block-
ing on the offensive line, with crushing double teams and traps that used
small, nimble linemen. Warner described all of this in his 1927 writings.
His offense would be the dominant formation in football for nearly half a
century, employed by coaches like Knute Rockne of Notre Dame (who ran
it from his famous "box" formation), Fritz Crisler of Michigan and Carl
Snavely of North Carolina.
Single wing tailbacks would be the glamour players of the sport. Be-
cause of strict substitution rules and conservative strategy, teams often
punted before fourth down. (When this notion was related to Belichick,
a football historian to his marrow, he fairly shouted back, "Fourth down?
They would punt on first down if the field position was bad enough!"
It's true. Time and again Racely's tapes show single wing teams pinned
deep in their own territory, only to punt immediately, hoping for a better
outcome on the next exchange). As a result of this quick-kick strategy,
single wing tailbacks were much more valuable if they could punt ef-
21

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
fectively. Those that flourished were true triple threats: runner, punter,
passer. Jim Thorpe was a single wing tailback under Warner at Carlisle.
So were George Gipp of Notre Dame, Ernie Nevers of Stanford, Nile
Kinnick of Iowa, Tom Harmon of Michigan and Doak Walker of TCU,
among many others.
Belichick's father, Steve, was a single wing fullback at Western Re-
serve University, and Belichick played in the single wing in junior high
and against it in prep school. "You found a guy back then who could do
all three things and stay on the field," says Belichick. "And the guys who
could do those things became your All-America, Heisman Trophy single
wing tailbacks."
The last of them was Princeton's Dick Kazmaier in 1951. Four years ear-
lier Michigan had won the national championship with an extraordinary
single wing backfield nicknamed the "Mad Magicians"; Princeton's ver-
sion was nearly as dazzling. On Ed Racely's big screen Kazmaier comes
to life in a 13-7 victory over Penn at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, the
Tigers' 16th consecutive victory in a streak that would reach 24 games
a year later. The cameraman often lost sight of the ball, and the camera
would swing left and right, searching. One can only imagine a defense's
confusion without benefit of the camera's stadium-top perch. The archi-
tect of Princeton's single wing was head coach Charlie Caldwell, who at
the conclusion of Kazmaier's career wrote a thick handbook on the of-
fense, so detailed in its descriptions that even modern single wing experts
find it occasionally impenetrable.
Even in the pretelevision NFL, the single wing had its moment. Jock
Sutherland, an All-America in Pop Warner's single wing at the University
of Pittsburgh in 1916, brought the single wing to the Pittsburgh Steelers
as head coach in '47. The Steelers, who had never won more than seven
games in a season, went 8-4 and lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in an
Eastern Division playoff game that season. Sutherland died of a brain
tumor before the '48 season and is remembered as the last coach to run
the single wing in the NFL.
It wasn't long before the T formation took over football, followed by
the I formation and the various two-back pro-style offenses. The passing
game matured. Substitution rules were altered. Two-platoon football and
more wide-open attacks made the triple-threat tailback unnecessary. By
22

THE SINGLE WING
the mid-1950s the single wing had become a relic. Tommy Prothro, who
learned the offense under Red Sanders while coaching at both Vanderbilt
and UCLA from '46 to '54, installed the single wing when he became head
coach at Oregon State in '55 but ditched it in '61 when Terry Baker, a tall,
graceful, lefthanded quarterback became the Beavers' starter. Passing out
of the wing-T, Baker won the Heisman Trophy in '62.
That left only Princeton, where Dick Colman had replaced Caldwell
as head coach in 1956 and changed nothing about the Tigers' offense;
Princeton continued running the single wing through the '60s and in '64
won the Ivy League championship with a 9-0 record. "It was so differ-
ent by then, it gave us an edge," says Cosmo Iacavazzi, a fullback on that
unbeaten team, voicing a theme that would be echoed much later. "We
were the only team running it, and that made it really tough for teams to
get ready to play us."
The last outpost of the college single wing— old school version—was
Denison University in Granville, Ohio, under coach Keith Piper from
1977 through '92. Journalists would occasionally pass through Piper's
domain to chronicle the antique, as if witnessing living history. One was
SPORTS iLLUSTRATED's Rick Telander, to whom Piper said in 1982,
"The thing that people don't understand about the single wing is that it
was never caught up with or overrun. It works. But football is like men's
fashions. Coaches don't run the single wing because they don't want to
be out of fashion."
Piper was a native Ohioan who was raised in Niles, rival to legendary
Massillon High. He became Denison's head coach, his first job in the
business, in 1954, six years after Woody Hayes left there. For 23 seasons
Piper ran the popular T formation before converting to the single wing
for the fall of '77. Telander wrote, "It took [Piper] that long, he says,
to realize the advantages of a forgotten system in a follow-the-leader
world. 'When you're at a school like this,' Piper said, 'where you don't
have great talent, the single wing is ideal. It's good for utilizing slower,
smaller players, and because opponents only see it once a year, you take
them by surprise.'
Piper retired from coaching after the 1992 season and died five years
later at the age of 76. His career record was 200-142-9, and just before his
death the stadium at Denison was named in his honor. Yet if Piper is remem-
23

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
bered by many for turning to a nearly forgotten system—in desperation? in
madness?—his reasoning has been borne out dozens of times since.
The single wing disappeared, in steady order, from the professional
game, major colleges, then small colleges. But it never completely died
at the high school level, and in some places it proved dominant. Apopka,
with its speed and talent, is a glaring exception. More commonly, the
single wing has served as an equalizer, the province of the disciplined
and the dedicated.
From the time Kazmaier
left Princeton through the late '90s, the
single wing had been kept on life support by a small cadre of devotees
like Ken Hofer of Menominee High in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan,
who won three state championships, the most recent in 2007; George
Rykovich of Manitou Springs High in Colorado, who won two state
championships; and Mark Bliss, who has run the offense at four high
schools since 1997 and won four state titles at Conway Springs High
in Kansas. They all had their bibles, most notably Dr. Ken Keuffel's
Winning Single Wing Football.
IF THE single wing was barely breathing through much of the '70s, '80s and
'90s, the offense seems to have suddenly sprouted a second life in the most
recent decade, enabled by Internet message boards on which coaches ex-
change ideas and tales from the trenches. The Single Wing Conclave, which
had begun in 2001 with a gathering of 11 high school coaches at Kings Col-
lege in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., had mushroomed; by the spring of 2008 there were
138 coaches at the annual event, replete with a preconclave mixer. A sum-
mer symposium organized by the National Single Wing Coaches' Association
started in 1996 with four coaches and now annually draws more than 100.
There are four primary reasons for the single wing's resurgence at the
high school level:
• It does not require a skilled quarterback, which is the toughest position
to fill on any team.
• Its complex double teams, trap blocks and backfield deceptions allow
teams that would otherwise be overmatched physically to be competitive.
• The offense, by snapping to a player who can run with the ball, forces
the defense to account for an extra running threat (instead of dismissing
the traditional quarterback as a handoff machine).
24

THE SINGLE WING
• It is still, even with its growing popularity, relatively rare, so it com-
plicates an opponent's preparation. Defenses simply don't see the
single wing often enough to defend
it comfortably, so
it becomes an
annoying disruption to the fastidiously organized practice and video
regimen that dominates every week in a football season at every level
of the game.
While these same axioms appeal to teams at the higher levels of
football, the single wing fits most comfortably in the high school game,
in which coaches still preach the values of teamwork, selflessness and
preparation as the foundations of success. Linemen working as one
unit, backs carrying out fakes and a center making accurate snaps— all
facets of the single wing—combine to give an undermanned team the
possibility of victory.

Chapter 2
THE
WINGT
The offense of the '50s was curated by a legend named
Tubby and elevated by a team of Fightin' Blue Hens
College, a tiny school about 100 miles west of Detroit, where he would be
a two-way lineman in the last decade of single wing dominance in college
football. An hour to the east, in Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan
was turning Tom Harmon into a Heisman Trophy winner in a single wing
backfield that included future Iowa coach Forest Evashevski and a 5' 7",
155-pound halfback named Dave Nelson.
Football innovation repeatedly proves itself the product of coincidence,
of personalities thrown together and forced to improvise strategy for the
sake of survival. In the fall of 1940, while Lude was playing college football
in a tiny backwater and Nelson was playing before 100,000 spectators in
the same backfield as one of the great tailbacks in the game's history, they
could never have known that a decade later they would together change
the course of offensive football.
Lude played three seasons at Hillsdale before spending three years
in the U.S. Marines. Nelson enlisted in the Naval Air Corps. Both were
discharged in the summer of 1946. Lude returned to Hillsdale for his de-
layed senior year, where Nelson, still just 26 years old, with his Michigan

pedigree, had been named the head coach. Nelson installed the single
wing, and Hillsdale went 7-1 in Lude's final college season. For Nelson's
second year at Hillsdale he made Lude, 25, his line coach. They coached
the single wing again, and the Chargers went 7-0-2, giving Nelson a two-
year record of 14-1-2.
(Back down the road in Ann Arbor, meanwhile, coach Fritz Crisler and
Michigan's single wing Mad Magicians, so named for their deft backfield
ball handling, went 9-0 in the regular season and crushed USC 49-0 in the
Rose Bowl. It was the convention of the time to crown national champions
before bowl games. Notre Dame was voted No. 1 by the Associated Press,
but Michigan was given the title in a postseason poll conducted by the AP.
The Mad Magicians are revered by single wing devotees as one of the most
skilled faking teams in the history of the offense. And they were the last
major-college team to win a national title running Pop Warner's offense).
In the wake of his success at Hillsdale, Nelson was hired as an assis-
tant coach at Harvard in 1948 and a year later as the head coach at the
University of Maine. He brought Lude with him to Maine as his line coach
and installed the single wing. The Black Bears went 2-4-1 in that first
year, and though they won the Yankee Conference with a 2-0-1 record,
Nelson, Lude and backfield coach Harold Westerman were unsure that
they should stay with the single wing.
"The biggest problem we had," says Lude,
"is that we kept going
through tailbacks. They were getting banged up. That's what happens
with the single wing—the tailback is going to get hit frequently." There
were other issues, as well, which would ultimately spell the demise of
the single wing at the upper levels of football. Maine did not have a do-
everything athlete like Harmon to play single wing tailback, and
it did
not have the backfield depth to distribute carries in the buzz-saw method
of truly effective single wing teams. Nelson, Lude and the Black Bears
needed another attack.
Throughout the 1940s the two dominant teams in college football had
been Army under head coach Earl (Red) Blaik and Notre Dame under Frank
Leahy. Each was running the full-house T formation, which was inexorably
replacing the single wing as the dominant formation in all higher levels of
football. (Famously, or notoriously, the Chicago Bears had run from the T for-
mation in their 73-0 NFL championship-game rout of the Washington Red-
28

THE WING T
skins in 1940, still the most lopsided title game in the history of the league.)
The T, which in its original form is largely regarded as the work of 19th
century football architect Walter Camp, put a quarterback under center,
from where he would distribute the ball to any one of three running backs.
It wasn't as tricky and deceptive as the single wing, but it put less pres-
sure on a single back. Its linemen were principally straight-ahead block-
ers, with
little of the complex double-teaming and trapping that made
the single wing effective. But it eliminated the need for a superathlete at
tailback, and it was working at Notre Dame and Army. So in the spring of
1950, as Lude recalls, "Coach Nelson sent me and Harold Westerman out
on the road to learn from Leahy."
Come the summer of 1950, Nelson and Lude were convinced that they
would put a quarterback under center. "Although," says Lude, "none of
us even knew how to teach a center-quarterback exchange because all we
had ever coached was single wing." And they were loath to give up the di-
abolical blocking schemes so effective in the single wing and afraid to let
go of the intricate backfield play fakes. They needed some sort of hybrid.
They stayed up late every night, tinkering with plays, trying to marry
single wing blocking and faking principles to an offense with the quarter-
back under center. "It was 3 a.m. on the night before the players reported
for practice before Dave finally made his decision," says Lude. "He just
all of sudden said, 'To heck with it; let's just go with
it. He took all our
blocking rules from the unbalanced single wing and converted them to a
balanced line." It was a mix of the single wing and T formations, but it
was the first step in bridging the dominant offense of the first half of the
20th century—Pop Warner's single wing—with what would become one
of the most important offenses of the ensuing 30 years.
It would eventually be called the wing T, because—simply enough—it
looked like the T formation with a single wing wingback, and it appeared
to have elements of both offenses. There was a quarterback under center
and a balanced line (T formation), and here were two backs in the back-
field and a wing flanked to the strong side of the formation (single wing).
The name was intuitive and practical.
Nelson's Maine Black Bears went 5-1-1 with their crude, improvised
wing T. In 1952 Nelson became the head coach at the University of Dela-
ware and again took Lude with him. It was there that the wing T really
29

Blood } Sweat and Chalk
took flight. Nelson coached the Blue Hens for 15 years and won more than
66% of his games. Three years into his tenure at Delaware he hired Har-
old (Tubby) Raymond as an assistant, and it was Raymond who became
the true curator of the wing T. A former single wing quarterback and
linebacker under Crisler at Michigan, Raymond—this can get confusing-
joined the Maine staff under Westerman in 1951 when Nelson and Lude
went to Delaware. The two staffs, Nelson's and Lude's at Delaware and
Westerman's and Raymond's at Maine, wore out clipboards refining the
wing T from its rough beginnings the previous year.
"We took what Nelson started at Maine and worked with it," says Ray-
mond. "The biggest differences between the wing T and everything that
came before it was that the offensive skill requirements were shared more
equally. You didn't need a Jack Armstrong at quarterback to do every-
thing. You had a balanced line, so the positions were symmetrical, instead
of asymmetrical. Now you could threaten several points of attack on the
line of scrimmage on every snap."
Twelve years after arriving at Delaware, Tubby Raymond took over as head
coach, a position he held for 36 years and 300 victories. His teams won three
national titles and 14 Lambert Cups, emblematic of Eastern small-college
supremacy. Raymond's success was sweeping and his offense so ingrained in
his program that the wing T became known as the Delaware Wing T.
The wing T was one of the first offensive systems built on the idea of
forcing the defense to make decisions in response to what it expects the
offense to run and then having the offense attack with something slightly
different. Raymond once told a coaching convention, "It is designed to
create defensive player reacts [sic] to stop a particular play, placing him-
self in jeopardy for a related play."
It was Raymond's staff at Delaware that evolved the wing T into a
truly modern offense, spreading the field, adding straight drop-back pass-
ing and, eventually, an option game. In a 1998 interview Raymond said,
"Prior to 1966, all of the formations [in the wing T] were tight [similar
to the single wing]
Our passing game was made up exclusively of
play-action passes. We didn't have any three-step or five-step drops. [But]
when we started in 1966, we incorporated the wideout and the various
drops
Our [other] contribution [was] running the triple option from
a wing formation, as opposed to the wishbone formation."
30

THE WING T
The success of the wing T was not limited to Delaware and Maine.
Even as Nelson and Raymond developed the offense, others followed and
sought their advice. It became part of historic programs at the highest
levels of the game. The first of those programs was Iowa, which adopted
the wing T under Evashevski and won the Rose Bowl following the 1956
season. Next came LSU.
Paul Dietzel had played on the line at Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, in the late 1940s on a post-World War II team that included future
coaching giants Bill Arnsparger, Ara Parseghian and Bo Schembechler.
He worked under Red Blaik at Army and Paul (Bear) Bryant at Kentucky
before being named head coach at LSU in 1955. The Bayou Bengals hadn't
won a Southeastern Conference tide since winning back-to-back SEC—
and national—championships in 1935 and '36. And the Dietzel Era did
not start with promise: LSU went 11-17-2 in Dietzel's
first three years,
running principally the T formation.
There was no groundswell of anticipation for the 1958 season. "Uni-
versity authorities expected no surge in fan interest. They ordered 30,000
tickets per game for a stadium that seated 67,510," according to a 2008
article in the Baton Rouge Advocate recalling that era. "There were a little
more than 9,000 season-ticket holders. The LSU student body numbered
less than 10,000."
Dietzel, however, saw promise: Junior running backs Billy Cannon
(who would go on to win the Heisman Trophy in 1959), Johnny Robinson
and junior quarterback Warren Rabb were all talented. "Splendid players,"
says Dietzel. "I knew that Davey Nelson and Mike Lude were running the
wing T up north, and when I had a chance to see it, I thought, That's a
nice-looking offense. The deception is good. With the T formation, the
defense always knows where the ball is going. I also liked that the wing T
always had a double team on the line of scrimmage at the point of attack
and usually a lead blocker. It was physical. It was a tough offense."
Dietzel brought Lude to Baton Rouge in the spring and asked him to
teach the offense to his staff. "They showed us the blocking and the ball
handling, everything," says Dietzel. "But then the real payoff was that
Cannon, Rabb and Robinson
all were working summer jobs in Baton
Rouge that summer. They got fascinated with the wing T. They worked
on the ball handling every day, and when fall practice started, they actu-
31

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
ally taught the offense to the rest of the team. When the season started, it
didn't look like we were running an offense that we'd never used before."
The Tigers opened the season with a 26-6 victory at Rice and then, in
Bear Bryant's first season at Alabama, beat the Crimson Tide in Mobile
13-3. After the game Dietzel recalled that Bryant was asked if the wing T
helped Cannon. "Coach Bryant said, T don't know about that, but I'll tell
you one thing: Billy Cannon sure helped the wing 1?
I guess that would
be true too."
LSU won the national tide in '58, going 11-0. DietzePs Tigers won an-
other SEC title in 1961 and another the year after that, when Dietzel had
gone to Army to replace Blaik and Charlie McClendon had taken over in
Baton Rouge. "The wing T was good for us " says Dietzel. "The best thing
was the toughness. The second-best thing was the misdirection. And
it
was not without passing. You run, run, run, and your receivers get lost out
there. We had a play where we would fake to the halfback on a cross buck
and then dump it off to the fullback in the flat, and I'll tell you, that was
one of the best plays we ever ran."
This was all in keeping with the flexibility of the offense. As the passing
game developed through the 1970s, the wing T evolved with it. Raymond
says, "When I came to Delaware in 1954, if you ran into a quarterback who
could beat you with the pass once every other year, that was really some-
thing. But
I always maintained, 'There
is no defense for a well-thrown
ball that's caught.' We had some great passers at Delaware—Jeff Komlo,
Scott Brunner, Rich Gannon. And when we had those great passers, we
used them in the offense accordingly."
Of course, not every team that turned to the wing T immediately won
a national championship or a major bowl. In the same spring that Lude
visited Baton Rouge, he also went to Fayetteville, Ark., where 33-year-old
Frank Broyles had just been hired as head coach. Broyles installed the
wing T and ran it in the season opener, a 12-0 loss to Baylor. The follow-
ing week Broyles scrapped the wing T and never ran it again. "There was
no problem with Davey Nelson's offense," Broyles recalled recently. "We
had a very inexperienced team, and we just didn't have the backs to prop-
erly run the offense. We didn't have Billy Cannon."
In the spring of 1973 Raymond got a call from Ara Parseghian, who
was looking to retool his Notre Dame offense. The Irish had gone 8-3 in
32

THE WING T
the '72 season, which may not sound disastrous, but it was the first time in
nine years that a Parseghian-coached Irish team had lost three games in
a season. Two of those came at the end of the season with a 45-23 loss at
USC and a 40-6 thrashing by Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. Parseghian
was looking for a change.
"He flew me into South Bend, and we met up in a room at the airport,"
recalls Raymond. "I showed him the offense and then we talked every
week afterwards, sometimes a couple times a week." Notre Dame went
11-0 in 1973 and won the national championship. The title was iced when
Notre Dame quarterback Tom Clements faked a cross-buck handoff on
third down from his own two-yard line and completed a 35-yard pass to
tight end Robin Weber, giving the Irish a first down and allowing them to
run out the clock against Alabama.
Parseghian invited Raymond back to South Bend in the spring of 1974
to watch film and evaluate Notre Dame's use of the wing T throughout the
previous season. Raymond had always put great stock in the sequencing
of plays, using certain formations and plays to set up others. He felt that
Notre Dame, despite its success, had been too random in its use of the of-
fense. "Your quarterback doesn't understand play- calling," Raymond told
Parseghian as they sat in a darkened film room.
Parseghian recoiled. "I call the plays!" he shouted.
Thirty-four years later, in the winter of 2008, seven years after his re-
tirement, Tubby Raymond, at age 81, was invited to speak at a national
wing T clinic in Pittsburgh. More than 700 coaches—most of them from
high schools and small colleges—attended, enthralled listening to the
original master of a still-vibrant attack.

The recent resurgence of an old idea has intriguing
portent— the end of the quarterback as we know him
embraces the essence of the game: size, speed and power versus tactical
strategy. Visiting Cheshire Academy is wearing white; home team West-
minster School is in black. Neither school benefits from the population
that would buttress a powerful football program; Cheshire has 324 stu-
dents in four high school grades, Westminster 385. But on this night, in
this season, Cheshire has bigger, faster athletes and would appear to be
the stronger team. Yet football is always a game in which there are two
ways to win—be better or be smarter.
Cheshire runs the popular spread offense, with a talented quarterback
throwing darts to tall, fast wide receivers in the middle of the Westmin-
ster defense. Westminster is running something from the Dark Ages of
football: a tight formation with a direct snap to a small, nimble senior
quarterback named Calvin Brownridge, who executes an array of roll-
out passes, keepers and quarterback dives. Execution keeps Westminster
close, and only a fourth-quarter pass interference call gives Cheshire the
opportunity to score a late touchdown and win a tight game, 19-14.

Dennis Daly, who has coached football at the college and high school levels
for more than three decades, shouts at a writer covering the game, "Tell
Coach Hugh Wyatt you saw his offense in action. And it worked."
SEVERAL WEEKS earlier, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., the
New England Patriots, who the previous season had won 18 consecutive
games before losing to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl, hosted
the Miami Dolphins, 0-2 and on the cusp of panic in a league where 0-3
nearly guarantees missing the playoffs. (It's the same game Jeremy Gallon
was watching in Chapter 1.)
The Dolphins beat the Patriots 38-13, largely on the success of an
offensive
attack they had never used
before:
running back Ronnie
Brown as a shotgun quarterback, with quarterback Chad Pennington
shifted to a wide receiver position and running back Ricky Williams as
a wingback. They lined up in the formation six times and scored four
touchdowns—three on runs by Brown, one on a pass from Brown to tight
end Anthony Fasano.
After the game Dolphins offensive coordinator Dan Henning called
the offense the David Lee Special, after his quarterbacks coach, but some
media members recognized it as the same package that Lee had run at
Arkansas in the previous two seasons, where it was called the Wildcat, or
the Wild Hog, the latter in deference to the Arkansas nickname. Lee had
pitched the offense to Henning on the flight home from the Dolphins'
31-10 loss at Arizona the previous weekend. "It had never come up before
that week," Pennington would say later in that season. "I wasn't shocked,
because I had been following some of the things that college teams were
doing. But at the same time a lot of things don't carry over [to the NFL].
The fact is, we needed some offensive energy, and that gave it to us."
Patriots veteran safety Rodney Harrison told reporters after the game,
"It's something we hadn't seen. We tried to make adjustments. We
still
didn't stop it."
Patriots coach
Bill Belichick knew exactly what he was watching.
And he knew that colleges were experimenting with
it. "We knew this
stuff was out there. We knew somebody was going to try it. But you've
got limited practice time, and you just can't waste any of it preparing for
something that a team hasn't shown yet."

THE WILDCAT
NFL coaches—coaches at any level, in fact—are fond of the expression,
It's a copycat league. It is their default response in explaining any trend.
And
it's generally true. Within hours of the Dolphins' victory over the
Patriots, at least half a dozen teams were exploring the use of some sort of
Wildcat-style package in their offenses.
And the concept was not entirely new to the league. Other NFL
teams had dabbled with it in recent years, which made the Dolphins'
all-in more of a culmination than a founding. NFL teams had been
selectively direct-snapping to an alternate back for the better part of
a decade. LaDainian Tomlinson, a future Hall of Fame running back,
had taken direct snaps, and thrown touchdown passes, for the Char-
gers. The Patriots had used running back Kevin Faulk in the shotgun.
Belichick recalled that Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger ran
off-tackle from a shotgun formation in his rookie season, in 2004.
Hines Ward, a former high school quarterback, had also taken snaps
for the Steelers. But
it was the Dolphins who took the last step and
truly committed to the system, using the Wildcat on almost one out of
ten snaps in 2008—and scoring 20% of their touchdowns with it. And
many teams immediately followed.
The Baltimore Ravens put in plays for then-second-year quarterback
Troy Smith, the 2006 Heisman Trophy winner as a run-pass threat at
Ohio State. "We were trying to tap into what Troy has done well in the
past," said Ravens offensive coordinator Cam Cameron. The Kansas
City Chiefs scored a touchdown on a Wildcat-based play when tailback
Jamaal Charles took a direct snap and pitched on a reverse to wideout
Mark Bradley, who then threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to quarterback
Tyler Thigpen, who was flanked wide right. "Pretty exciting," says Thig-
pen. "When I got deep, I looked back and I was thinking, is he throwing
the ball to me?" The Atlanta Falcons ran several direct snap plays to
running back Jerious Norwood, a high school quarterback in Missis-
sippi. "You can hear the defenses just checking off like crazy, getting
ready for the run," Norwood says. "But I can throw it."
The philosophy of the Wildcat is based on simple math. Defenses
traditionally try to account for every possible ballcarrier and every gap.
In doing so, they disregard a quarterback under center (except in an
option system). "When you put a quarterback under center, you lose a
37

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
blocker, you lose a gap, offensively," says Belichick. "You basically play
with 10 men on offense. But when the quarterback is one of the runners,
whether
it's single wing or veer or wishbone, the defense runs out of
people to defend you."
The ancient roots of the system are obvious, as Belichick indicated:
the single wing. Snap the ball to a runner and let him carry it. The recent
renaissance is trickier to pinpoint. In the days following the Dolphins' un-
veiling of their Wildcat, attention was quickly focused on Lee, the team's
first-year quarterbacks coach. From Lee, the etymology of the offense was
traced back to Gus Malzahn, who was by then working as the offensive
coordinator at the University of Tulsa.
The desk in Malzahn's office at Tulsa is absolutely clean.
It is clean
because Malzahn spends almost no time in this room, but rather in the
meeting room next door, scrawling offensive sets on a white board and
studying tape in the darkness. Malzahn, 43 on this day in 2008, is a foot-
ball
lifer. He was a high school wide receiver in Fort Smith, Ark., and
walked on at the University of Arkansas in 1984. "I tried, but I wasn't
good enough," he says. He transferred to Henderson State College in
Arkadelphia, Ark., and graduated in '90.
Malzahn went straight into high school coaching. "Always wanted to
be a coach," he says. "Never wanted to do anything else." He coached for
five years—the last four as head coach—at Hughes High in the northeast
Arkansas delta. In 1996 he started a five-year run at Shiloh Christian High
in Springdale, Ark.; his teams won two state titles and roasted defenses
with a spread passing game. In 2001 he took his offense to Springdale
High, a national power.
Among Malzahn's players at Springdale was a fast flanker named Dusty
Johnson, who had also been a junior high quarterback. Malzahn rumi-
nated on creative ways to get Johnson the football and attack the defense.
Eventually Malzahn put Johnson in the shotgun and a ran variety of plays:
a quarterback power series, a reverse and a speed sweep to a wingback cut-
ting across the formation—exactly as the Dolphins would run seven years
later with Ronnie Brown handing off to Ricky Williams. "We had pretty
good success with it," says Malzhan. "People started asking me if I had any
background in the single wing. I didn't know what they meant."
Malzhan was named offensive coordinator at the University of Ar-
38

THE WILDCAT
kansas in 2005 and began effectively using the formation with Darren
McFadden (who would land in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders) in
the tailback position and Felix Jones (who would go to the Dallas Cow-
boys) as a wingback running the speed sweep. "I brought the quarter-
back power [run] and speed sweep with me to Arkansas," says Malzahn.
"One of my good friends coached McFadden and told me that McFadden
had some experience playing quarterback when he was younger. Well,
that's just the kind of guy you want back there because he's a threat to
throw it too. Felix Jones could
fly, so he was the perfect speed sweep
guy. In a key '06 game, McFadden rushed for 181 yards and two touch-
downs and threw for a third in a win over Tennessee. ESPN's GameDay
crew was in attendance. "My phone started ringing pretty good after
that game," says Malzahn.
The name Wildcat first popularly surfaced in that same 2006 season.
Malzahn's explanation for the name
is circuitous:
"I didn't call
it the
Wildcat when I was at Springdale. I think we called it Heavy. When I got
to Arkansas, they already had an unbalanced formation that they called
Wildcat.
I think they got that from Kansas State." (Kansas State's nick-
name is the Wildcats.) "I think we just kept that name," says Malzahn.
In a faraway corner of America, Hugh Wyatt vigorously disputes
Malzahn's ownership
of the
Wildcat,
classic
evidence
of the
liquid
nature
of football
innovation. Wyatt, born
in
1938,
is an
energetic,
entrepreneurial—and
just
slightly
eccentric—Yale
graduate who
has
coached high school football for 32 years and, in the summer of 2009,
was preparing to begin his second season as coach of the North Beach
Hyaks in Ocean Shores, Wash.
"I believe Gus Malzahn has a selective
memory," he says.
Wyatt played on the freshman football team at Yale in the 1950s and
then served as practice fodder for the varsity for three years. Upon grad-
uation he worked a decade in the business world before yielding to his
passion and returning to football in 1970. First he coached and operated
a semipro team in Maryland, and that earned him two years in front-
office positions with teams in the soon-to-be-defunct World Football
League. In 1976, at age 38, he started teaching and coaching at a small
high school in Oregon. In the ensuing 32 years—in addition to jobs in
Louisiana, Oregon and, of all places, Finland (where he coached football
39

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
for seven years and got his first look at the double wing offense that he
would refine and market)—he was a head coach at six high schools and
an assistant at four.
Wyatt has been a highly successful coach, often taking teams with
minimal resources and talent and using his tight-split, double wing
offense to maximize his team's chances. When he first began coach-
ing, he ran the Delaware wing T but gradually began molding the
double wing that became his signature offense. "What
I espouse
is
a derivation of the single wing," says Wyatt. "The blocking all comes
from the single wing."
In addition to his coaching success Wyatt sells DVDs that instruct
coaches on the process of installing the offense and conducts instruc-
tional clinics that are extremely popular among high school coaches.
Dennis Daly, the aforementioned Westminster School coach, faced
precisely the type of manpower deficit that Wyatt's double wing has
often overcome. In the fall of 2008 Westminster started the season
with
five consecutive victories despite playing teams with a decid-
ed size and speed advantage. "The offense gives us a chance to get
double teams at the point of attack," Daly says. "It's our best way to
equalize the game."
Yet for all the popularity of the double wing among high school coach-
es, it is the direct snap Wildcat series that has made Wyatt a true pioneer.
He says he first ran—and named—the package in the fall of 1997. He was
at the time the head coach at La Center High in Washington state, and
La Center's school mascot was the Wildcat.
In a magazine article in '98 Wyatt wrote,
Whenever you've thought about throwing a curve at an opponent, the idea
of running the Single Wing may have crossed your mind. Perhaps you've
actually seen it in action—after all, a handful of schools still run it. Or may-
be you've heard the old-timers talk about its legendary power and decep-
tion. You just know that its uniqueness alone would drive defenses crazy.
You'd like to look at it, but you just don't know how to start.
In that case, you might want to take a look at our "Wildcat" package.
Nicknamed for our school's mascot, it's our direct-snap package—and an
adjunct to the Double Wing system that we've been running since 1990.
40

THE WILDCAT
WYATT GOES on to describe an offensive package that includes a se-
ries in which one of his two wingbacks—who line up facing inward at a
45-degree angle, rather than directly facing the defense—runs across the
formation and takes a handoff before continuing on around the opposite
end. It is almost identical to Malzahn's Shiloh/Springdale/Arkansas speed
sweep. In the winter of 2009 Wyatt wrote on his website: "Over the years
I've explained and shown the Wildcat to hundreds of coaches at clinics
and camps, and sold numerous playbooks and videos. I haven't the slight-
est idea how many teams have actually run my Wildcat at one time or
another, but there's a lot of them, and they know how it got its name."
When Malzahn was asked if he had, indeed, picked up the Wildcat
from Hugh Wyatt, he said, "Hugh Wyatt. I've heard that name. Well, I'm
sure I got it from somewhere. I just couldn't tell you where."
If the name and creator of the Wildcat is in dispute, its place in foot-
ball is not. "The single wing type stuff is going to become more the norm
in the future," says veteran NFL coach and offensive coordinator Chan
Gailey. "Over the next 10 or 15 years
it's going to evolve because the
runner-thrower is the kind of quarterback that the college game is produc-
ing now. You don't find a ton of the six-three, six-four, drop-back, stand-
up passer. They're not in college, so we're not getting them up here."
When Cam Cameron was head coach of the Dolphins in 2006, he no-
ticed a sea change in the quarterback position at all levels of the sport.
"I saw little kids playing Pop Warner—seven, eight, nine years old, doing
the belly-read option from a shotgun," says Cameron. "I was absolutely
floored by the stuff they were doing so young."
But wait: Isn't there madness in exposing a $10-million-a-year quarter-
back to a succession of crushing hits at the NFL level. "The hitting really
is at a much higher level than college," says quarterback Pennington. "I
don't think you would last very long."
Says Cameron, "It's one thing to have Darren McFadden back there,
but your quarterback?
I don't know about that. Maybe [Florida's Tim]
Tebow can do it in this league."
The voices of the NFL cannot speak quickly or loudly enough in swat-
ting aside the concept of running from the quarterback position. Yet
coaches keep trying, whether in Lou Holtz's failed attempt to run the
outside veer option with the New York Jets three decades ago or the Ten-
41

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
nessee Titans' halfhearted attempt to incorporate Vince Young's feet into
their offense, along with his arm. And many in between. There is clearly
value, and seduction, in the idea of a pro quarterback who can throw and
run and also survive. The question is, can it be done, and with whom?
As he began his pursuit of a second Heisman Trophy at Florida in the
fall of 2009, the player who magnified this debate was Tim Tebow. Florida
won the national championship with Tebow as a freshman in '06. Media
fell over themselves in proclaiming coach Urban Meyer's offense the ul-
timate modern "spread" game (Chapter 15), but the quarterback running
game was pure throwback. Tebow took direct snaps and ran off-tackle,
just like George Gipp. Single wing groupies everywhere went wild when
Tebow threw a jump pass—running toward the line of scrimmage as if to
carry off-tackle, then jumping and throwing—for a touchdown against
LSU. Dick Kazmaier used to throw jump passes at Princeton; you can see
them right there in Ed Racely's Cape Cod garage. And here was Tebow
doing the same thing.
Tebow won the Heisman Trophy in '07, passing for 32 touchdowns
and running for 23, a true double threat, and at 6
? 2/2", 238 pounds, a
durable one. The professional game has evolved significantly in many
ways, but the quarterback position really has not. The ideal NFL quarter-
back remains an accurate thrower who can make decisions under pres-
sure and, if rushed, buy time in the pocket. For all its growth, the league
has not yet produced a player who is equally dangerous as a runner and
a passer. (Michael Vick? Vince Young? Please.) With the influx of single
wing-based offensive packages, the door is open. And at lower levels of
the game the position has continued to move closer to the Tebow model
than the statuesque Tom Brady version.
"There aren't many players who can run and throw," says Belichick.
"Tebow, obviously, is a special one. But you've got major questions, be-
cause if you're going to run him 15 times a game, how long will he last
before they break him in half? But he is obviously special, and
it's go-
ing to be very interesting to see what happens when he comes into this
league. Do you just run your regular offense and let him scramble when
he scrambles? Do you put in a few plays just for him? Or do you really
build an entire new offense around him?"
Tebow (who, to the surprise of many, was taken in the first round of
42

THE WILDCAT
the 2010 draft by the Denver Broncos) may or may not not be the player
who bridges the college game to the NFL. Kansas State's Michael Bishop,
a dynamic college player, couldn't do
it because he lacked the passing
skills. Vick was even more dynamic, but ultimately—thus far—has failed
for the same reason, caught between his spellbinding running skills and
his limited passing accuracy. He was a running back playing quarterback,
and that simply can't be anything more than a novelty.
Yet there are those who see the transition to a different kind of player,
and a different kind of offense, as inevitable. "There are only so many
plays in football; all we're doing is finding different ways to run them
all," says Gailey. "But there's no escaping the fact that high school and
college football are developing a different type of athlete. Pretty soon—
I
don't know how long, but pretty soon—somebody is going to find an
athlete who can run and throw and just take the conventional quarter-
back off the field."

WISHBONE
A good of Texas coach had a crazy idea, his boss said O.K.,
and the damn thing tore through football like a tornado
South Bend to play Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish were three seasons re-
moved from their last serious national title run, but they still represented
a formidable program, stocked with prized recruits. Notre Dame was 4-1,
having lost only to a powerful Ohio State team. Air Force was 3-2, hav-
ing been beaten in September at Wyoming and by Navy on the weekend
before flying in to face Notre Dame. The Falcons were overmatched and,
remarkably, were still using a piece of college football memorabilia that
was seemingly the province of only the stubborn and the desperate.
College football fans of a certain age would recognize the formation and
its basic plays: A quarterback under center with three running backs be-
hind him in a Y shape, a fake (or handoff) to the fullback and then a classic
keep-or-pitch option to the outside. It was a part of history. At its birth in
1968 Texas sprung the wishbone on an unsuspecting Southwest Confer-
ence and tore through 30 consecutive victories. The Longhorns' formation
begat Oklahoma's wildfire 'bone that ripped up the sport for a decade and
a half and spawned hundreds of imitators at all levels of the game. "That
offense, it changed the game of football for 20 years," says Bill Bradley, a
South Bend, Ind.
October 1996
HEY CAME bearing a relic.
On a splendid college foot-
ball
fall weekend the Air
Force Academy arrived in
45

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
veteran NFL assistant coach who also happened to be the first wishbone
quarterback in history while a senior at Texas.
The wishbone had even carried into the NFL. In 1981 Archie Manning
was in his 11th year as quarterback with the New Orleans Saints. Bum Phil-
lips was in his first season as the team's head coach, and he thought it might
be useful to install an option play, recalling Manning as a scrambling folk
hero from Ole Miss. In the third game of the season the Saints played the
Giants in New Jersey, and Phillips called the option. Manning was ever the
good soldier but, at age 32, he'd been battered by years of pounding on poor
teams and long ago had been robbed of his quickness. He wobbled down
the line of scrimmage with the ball and at the corner found himself face-
to-face with Giants rookie linebacker Lawrence Taylor, a 22-year-old, 6' 3",
237-pound force of nature. Taylor exploded into Manning and deposited
him on the concrete-hard artificial turf. "I knew I was done right there," said
Manning. "And that was the last time we ran the option with the Saints."
Yet it was instructive that they tried. At the college level Texas (1969),
Oklahoma ('74 and '75) and Alabama ('78 and '79) won national titles with
the pure wishbone not long after its inception. Oklahoma (again, in '85),
Notre Dame ('88) and Colorado ('90) did likewise with offenses based
largely on triple-option principles. Yet by that day in South Bend in '96
it had become almost invisible on Saturday afternoons. Nebraska alone
among major powers swam upstream against the trend, winning national
titles in '94, '95 and '97 with an I formation-based option game. The wish-
bone was used almost exclusively by the service academies and dismissed
by many as a crutch for the undermanned.
Reasons for the wishbone's decline were unclear. "I think it's one word:
recruiting," says Lou Holtz, who ran option football at five stops in his col-
lege coaching career, including with his Notre Dame national champion
in 1988. "Once alumni started treating recruiting like it was a season in
itself, it became very difficult to run the option. All of a sudden, [if you were
an option team,] you couldn't get the dominant quarterback, because you
weren't going to throw the football and get him ready for the NFL. You
couldn't get the dominant left tackle, because you weren't going to teach
him to pass-block. You couldn't get the dominant running back, because he
wasn't going to be featured enough. Now, you can still win with the option
even ifyou don't get those people, but if you're not getting those top recruits,
46

THE WISHBONE
the alumni start to think you're losing and you're not exciting enough."
It was within this atmosphere, though, that the 1996 Air Force team and
its 13th-year head coach, Fisher DeBerry, remained scrupulously committed
to wishbone and flexbone hybrids. A year earlier in Colorado Springs, Notre
Dame had pounded Air Force 44-14, racing to an early lead and shutting
down the 'bone with a physical front. In '96 the Irish were physical again.
Air Force was led by senior quarterback Beau Morgan, a rugged Texan
who would leave the academy as the first college quarterback in history
to pass and run for 1,000 yards in each of two consecutive seasons. But
Morgan had serious doubts about this game. In midweek, after watching
film of the Fighting Irish, he called his father, Barry, who had coached him
at Trinity Christian Academy in Texas. "These guys are so good up front,"
Beau told his dad, "I don't know if we'll gain a yard."
As
it turned out, they gained lots of yards—304 on the ground and
355 overall. Morgan rushed for 183 yards on 23 carries, repeatedly attack-
ing the middle of the Notre Dame defense with a wishbone variation called
the midline option, in which Morgan often carried behind a blocking back
nearly straight up the middle of Notre Dame's defense. They did
it with
a makeshift offensive line—sophomore Zach Jordan, a 240-pound guard,
replaced injured Shawn Tellers after just three plays, and sophomore tackle
Frank Mindrup started the game for the injured Chuck Parks. Most of all,
they did it with superb wishbone execution, leaving Notre Dame in befud-
dled frustration. It was a classic predicament: Notre Dame, with superior
talent, faced a seldom-seen offense with just a week to prepare. The Irish
knew it too. Before the game, according to a story published in USA Today
three days later, Notre Dame defensive coordinator Bob Davie, who would
become head coach the following season, said he'd told Holtz before the
game, "Coach, I am just amazed that more people in college football don't
run the wishbone." Davie added, "I was always afraid to say that publicly
because I'm a defensive coach. I don't want more guys going to it. It really is
an amazing offense." (As for Holtz, his appreciation of the offense has never
wavered. "If I was hired again somewhere," Holtz says, "and they told me
they wanted to win the national championship, I would immediately put in
the option. The dumbest thing I ever did in my career was get away from it.
To this day, it is an offense that cannot be defended")
The game's critical call came with just over seven minutes to play, when
47

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Air Force faced fourth-and-one at the Notre Dame 26-yard line, trailing 17-10.
The Falcons ran their basic triple option, Right 35—"It took me two seconds
to call the play," says Morgan—and Notre Dame attacked Morgan on the cor-
ner with two tacklers, trying to force a rushed decision and an errant pitch
or fumble. Typical of good wishbone teams, however, Air Force had spent
15 minutes every day on a drill called Ride and Decide, in which scout-team
players would attack Morgan even more aggressively than the Irish defend-
ers did, making him pitch with urgency under heavy pressure. "What Notre
Dame did to me," Morgan said, "I had seen every day for three years."
Morgan kicked the ball outside in the instant the pressure reached him,
sending halfback Tobin Ruff to the outside—and all the way into the end
zone for the tying score. Air Force won with a field goal in overtime. In the
locker room after the game, Notre Dame freshman free safety Deke Cooper
put words to the helplessness felt by so many teams beaten by wishbone
football. "I was just confused," said Cooper. "I didn't know what was going
on. In practice I was picking it up. But on the field it was totally different."
Today Beau Morgan understands even better what took place on that after-
noon and many others like it. "Notre Dame was a step behind all day," he says.
"They had a defense that was very skilled, very tough, very fast, but they were
unable to play the way they played against Ohio State or some other team with
similar talent, because against us, they didn't know who had the ball."
Austin, Texas
Summer 1968
THESE WERE restless times for Longhorns football. A decade earlier coach
Darrell Royal, a native Oklahoman who once played postwar defensive back
and quarterback for Bud Wilkinson's powerhouse Sooners, had crossed the
Red River to restore Texas to its burnt-orange glory. He took over in 1957
and had it rolling by '59, when the Horns went 9-2. They lost only eight
games, with two ties, in a six-season stretch that included a national title in
the 1963 season, when they beat Roger Staubach and Navy in the Cotton
Bowl. But by '68 those days seemed long distant and memories had grown
short. Texas had lost four games in each of three consecutive seasons, fall-
ing twice each to Arkansas, SMU and TCU. After closing the '67 season
with consecutive losses to TCU and rival Texas A&M, Royal turned down a
48

THE WISHBONE
bid to the Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston, the same bowl the Longhorns had
played in to end their previous season. It seemed that Royal was downright
embarrassed to go back a second time to a consolation bowl.
Changes would ensue. Royal reworked his staff, most significantly placing
the Longhorns' inert offense (just 186 points in 10 games in '67) in the hands
of 40-year-old linebackers coach Emory Bellard.
It was a curious choice—
Bellard had been in college football for all of one year after coaching 17 years
of high school football at three different stops in Texas. On Dec. 17, 1966, Bel-
lard's team from San Angelo Central High in West Texas had beaten Spring
Branch High of Houston 21-14 for the Texas State Class 4A championship at
Memorial Stadium in Austin. That victory had come on Bellard's 39th birth-
day, and soon thereafter Royal summoned him to the state university. "Every
year since 1954 1 had opportunities to go to at least one school in the South-
west Conference," says Bellard. "But
I loved the high school atmosphere.
Then Darrell called, and of course, that's the only place I would have gone."
Bellard was disappointed in what he found. "We had a really poor football
team," he says. "We went 6-4 that season, nothing like what I would have ex-
pected from the University of Texas." He was on the road south of Abilene in
central Texas recruiting a linebacker that spring when Royal called to inform
him that Bellard would now be calling plays in the autumn. Lord help me,
thought Bellard. But he knew the freshman squad—first-year players were
ineligible for varsity in those days—was strong, led by fullback Steve (Woo)
Worster and wide receiver Charles (Cotton) Speyrer. As the spring unfolded,
Bellard began installing a basic split-T formation offense, which had first
been used by Don Faurot at Missouri in the 1940s and included rudimentary
option plays. He had a different idea in his head, but that he took home with
him, letting it rattle around his brain, imagining what it could do, as the Texas
spring turned to summer, the temperature rising and the pressure building.
Forty years later Emory Bellard, 80 years old, stands on the back patio of
his ranch home in Georgetown, Texas, a half hour north ofAustin. The house
abuts a golf course, and just off the porch is the tee box for the 3rd hole, a long
dogleg right. Bellard doesn't play much golf anymore, but slim and vibrant in
a green sweater and khaki pants, he looks like he could tee it up just fine.
He holds the wishbone close to his soul. In a sense
it was the perfect
marriage of man and method, an offense for the overmatched created by a
small-sized man working in a big man's game.
49

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Like almost all football coaches, Bellard paid his dues toiling for years at
the lowest levels of the game. Born in Luling, Texas, south of Austin, Bellard
was raised in the small South Texas town of Port Aransas but didn't play
football in high school until he was a junior, a single wing tailback at Aransas
Pass High. (He was also on the track team and claims he once did 63 chin-ups
in one minute while competing in a now extinct state championship event
called the rural pentathlon.) He enlisted in the Army shortly after graduat-
ing in the spring of 1945, but the war ended soon after, and Bellard headed
off to the University of Texas, a 5' 9", 165-pound scatback joining the biggest
nationwide influx of college football players in the history of the game. He
played on the freshman team in the fall of '45 and broke his leg. "Went from
10-flat in the hundred to 11-flat," he says. He never won a letter in Austin and
finished up at Southwest Texas State Teachers College. He became a coach in
the fall of '50 at Alice High, west of Corpus Christi, where he worked under
former Detroit Lions offensive lineman Ox Emerson, who taught him the
basics of scouting and strategy. He would spend 16 more seasons coaching at
three more Texas high schools and win three prized state titles.
It was during Bellard's last year at Ingleside High in 1954 that he began
to experiment with the roots of what would become the wishbone. "We
had a good athlete playing quarterback that year and another good one
coming up," says Bellard. "They could both do a lot of things. There were
some things I thought we might be able to do with the quarterback and the
fullback." Option football was not new; when Royal played at Oklahoma,
the Sooners ran a straight down-the-line option with no fake to a fullback.
Other teams had done likewise, sending the quarterback to the corner of
the line with the "option" to keep the ball or pitch it out, based on the reac-
tion of the contain player on the edge. But Bellard started thinking of ways
to incorporate the fullback, for a third option. (In keeping with the overlap-
ping nature of the history of football innovation, Barry Switzer would later
suggest that Bellard may have picked up some of his ideas from Charles
(Spud) Cason, a junior high school coach in Fort Worth in the '50s, who is
said to have experimented with similar schemes.)
Between 1955 and his arrival at Texas in '67, Bellard was endlessly sketch-
ing possibilities for his new offense. He was clearly influenced by Bill Yeoman,
the University of Houston head coach; it was Yeoman who truly introduced
the triple option to college football, in the form of his split back
tcveer" offense
50

THE WISHBONE
in 1965. Yeoman was a Midwesterner who had played for coach Red Blaik at
Armyjust after World War II and got his first head coachingjob at Houston in
'62. After starting out a promising 7-4 in his first season, Yeoman's Cougars
slipped to 2-8 in '63 and were 2-4-1 in November of '64, preparing to play
Perm State at home, when they happened onto the triple option by accident.
"We were getting ready for Penn State, Coach" recalls Yeoman—he calls
his interviewer "Coach" throughout a long conversation. "And I wanted to
run an old power sweep into a short slot. For some reason, I don't remember
why, we had the two halfbacks lined up behind the guards on each side. Well,
we ran a dive inside there, and the defensive tackle came way upheld and we
cut it up inside him. The next morning we looked at the film and I said, 'Hold
on a minute, let's look at that.' And we put it in against Penn State, and even
though we got beat, Coach, we ran for a whole bunch of yards."
In the spring Yeoman installed the veer, so-named because the front-side
halfback "veers" slightly to the outside while the quarterback puts the ball in
the halfback's belly and either gives it to him (option 1) or keeps it, depending
on the movement ofthe defensive tackle. After that initial read, the quarterback
would either run upfield (option 2) or pitch it to the trailing halfback (option 3)
from the back side of the formation. Early in the '65 season Yeoman got cold
feet and didn't often run his new triple-option veer, and the Cougars started
out 1-5. Before a Halloween weekend game against Tennessee-Chattanooga
("Good thing it was Tennessee-Chattanooga," he says), Yeoman told his team,
"We're going to run this thing the way we ran it in the spring."
The Cougars went 3-0-1 in their last four games and went 47-15-2 over
the next six seasons, half a step ahead of America in running the triple op-
tion. "We weren't going to be able to muscle anybody out," remembers Yeo-
man. "But with the veer, at least for a few years, nobody knew what we were
doing, so they couldn't stop us." It helped that from 1965 to '67 Yeoman had
a brilliant halfback named Warren McVea and in '67 and '68 a smart, slip-
pery quarterback named Paul Gipson.
Bellard was watching Houston's success and kept tinkering with his
own version. He conceived three building blocks, some of which mirrored
Yeoman's offense, and some of which did not:
1) Formation Instead of two running backs behind the quarterback, there
would be three. They would line up in a fashion similar to a straight-T full
house (which was not new), except that the fullback—the middle of the
51

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
three running backs—would be moved forward. Conceptually, this would
allow the first option (the fullback dive) to hit more quickly, speeding up
the entire offense and forcing quick decisions from the defense. Visually, it
would look like a letter Y.
2) Reads The triple option, right or left, was the basis from which all wishbone
plays would develop. Its first movement, again, had the quarterback putting
the ball in the belly of the fullback and reading the defensive tackle, who was
not being btocked; instead, he was allowed to come free. If he attacked the
fullback, the quarterback pulled the ball out of the fullback's belly and con-
tinued on down the line for the second and third options. If the tackle ignored
the fullback, driving straight upheld to impede the quarterback's movement
down the line, the quarterback gave the ball to the fullback. If the quarter-
back kept the ball, he would sprint down the line of scrimmage until he en-
countered an outside defender, usually a defensive end or outside linebacker,
but occasionally a strong safety. If that defender attacked the quarterback, the
QB would flip—pitch—the ball outside to a trailing halfback. "If you're doing
it right, there are two defenders on the line of scrimmage who you don't even
have to block," says Fisher DeBerry, who ran the option for 23 seasons at Air
Force. "You're just reading them both with the quarterback."
3) Blocking Not only was Bellard proposing to read two blocks on the of-
fensive front (Yeoman's veer read only the outside defender), but he was
also using the front-side halfback (the one closest to the corner) as a lead
blocker. While the quarterback worked down the line of scrimmage, the
trailing halfback accelerated into open space to receive the pitch (ideally
slashing upheld just as the quarterback flipped the ball to him). The lead
halfback would barrel forward, blocking any defender in the gaps.
THERE WERE other wrinkles in the offense that Bellard had in mind, and
other coaches would later add many more. "It all came down to one-two-
three," he says. "One, somebody has to take the quarterback on the outside.
Two, somebody has to take the pitch man. Three, somebody has to cover
the deep third or you can beat 'em with the vertical passing game. And we
did that." As summer arrived in '68, Bellard still wasn't ready to bring his
offense to Royal. In the backyard of his Austin home he lined up his sons-
Emory, Jr. was 18, and Bob was just eight—and one of their friends in his
new formation. Bellard played quarterback himself. Just to see it with live
52

THE WISHBONE
bodies. And it looked like it worked. He went over to the Texas campus and
rounded up some football players who had exhausted their eligibility, and
he again played quarterback while they ran the other positions. Again, it
looked viable. "One thing I knew," says Bellard. "If I could run
it, I knew
durn sure I could teach good athletes to run it."
Still, he kept his baby under wraps. Royal was under intense heat from
spoiled Texas alums; for Bellard to suggest a virgin offense, virtually un-
tested, was a mighty risk. Bellard found a former UT quarterback named
Andy White, who had been with the Longhorns in '66, and asked him to
run the formation with Bellard's band of postgrads. Again,
it seemed to
click, and at last Bellard felt ready to take it to the head coach. He went to
Royal's office in Gregory Gym, Bellard smoking his ever-present pipe, and
drew the new scheme up on a chalkboard. Then he walked Royal down to
the field in Memorial Stadium, where White and his ersatz teammates were
waiting to demonstrate. Royal watched impassively at first and then began
to coach. After little more than an hour of repetition, he turned to Bellard
and said, "Let's go with it."
To this day Bellard is humbled by the thought of that. "People hardly re-
member how tough those times were," he says. "Darrell had gone 6-4, 7-4,
6-4, and here I am suggesting something way out of the mold. But he looked
at it, and he understood it, and he put his stamp on it. That took a lot of guts."
They would need the right quarterback to run
it. At the start of two-a-
day practices in the summer of 1968, Bill Bradley was the Texas Longhorns
quarterback. Bradley had been dubbed Super Bill for his high school ex-
ploits; he was a Texas schoolboy legend in a state that worships at the altar
of Friday-night football and exalts its young heroes more fervently than
most. His reputation took root in the fall of '64. As a senior quarterback at
Palestine High ("God's country!" a wisecracking Bradley would hoot more
than four decades later. "The Holy Land!"), Bradley led his team to the Tex-
as Class 3A state title. He was a righthanded quarterback who sometimes
threw with his left. He punted too, and Texas teammates would recall that,
just for fun, he would occasionally launch a high hanger during practice
and then sprint down the field and catch it, cackling all the way. At Texas
he had presided over the last two of Royal's four-loss seasons, but it never
occurred to anyone that the mediocrity was the fault of Super Bill.
As the starter for the '68 season, Bradley would operate the new offense,
53

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
which did not yet have a name. The halfbacks would be senior Chris Gilbert and
junior Ted Koy (whose father, Ernie Sr., had been a Longhorns star in the early
1930s and whose older brother, Ernie Jr., was in the NFL with the New York Gi-
ants). Steve Worster, the heralded sophomore, was installed as the all-important
fullback The pieces were in place. And they almost instantly crumbled.
Texas was tied by Houston 20-20 in the season opener at Memorial
Stadium. But Bellard's offense did get its name that night when Royal met
with a group of sportswriters at the Villa Capri Hotel in Austin. According
to historian Bill Little, one of the reporters asked Royal what he should call
this new offense, albeit such an unsuccessful one in the opener. Said the
writer, "It looks like a Y."
From near the door Mickey Herskowitz of the Houston Post said, "It
looks like a pulley-bone." That sounded about right to Royal, who said,
"O.K. The wishbone."
It appeared the name might die a quick and quiet death. A week later
in Lubbock, Texas Tech beat the Longhorns 31-22, a loss that would knock
Texas from the national rankings. Bradley was struggling with Bellard's of-
fense. "One of the greatest athletes I've ever seen," recalls Bellard. "But he
was Super Bill, and he had created so many things in his mind that he just
had to do, and he was trying to do it all. And nobody can do it all."
In the spring of 2008 Bradley was employed as the defensive backfield
coach for the San Diego Chargers, as full of piss and vinegar as he had been
as a teenager in Austin, and he remembered the start of the '68 season as if
it had just happened. "Here's what you're lookin' at," says Bradley. "You've
got a team that went 6-4, 7-4 and 6-4. Now we're 0-1-1 in 1968, and we're
all flyin' on two twin-engine planes out of Lubbock in the middle of the
night back to Austin. We've got an embryo offense and a quarterback who
can't operate it properly. Got that? So we land at, I don't know, two or three
in the morning, and then there's a knock on my door at 5:30 a.m. Sunday.
I'm dead asleep. Voice on the other side of the door says, 'Bill, Coach Royal
wants to see you in his office.' Well, you know what Coach Royal used to
say: 'When you pass the ball, three things can happen, and two of them are
bad'? Well, when you get called into his office at 5:30 on Sunday morning
and you're the quarterback and you're 0-1-1, there's about five things that
can happen, and all of 'em are bad."
Bradley dragged himself over to the same Gregory Gym office where
54

THE WISHBONE
Bellard had sold Royal on the new offense two months earlier. Royal, a
dominant and intimidating figure in the game and in the state, fixed his
eyes on Super Bill and said, "Bill, we're fixin' to make some changes, and
I'm startin' with you."
Says Bradley, "I'm 20 years old. And I am devastated." Royal shuffled
four or five other positions that day, but none, of course, was more impor-
tant than quarterback. Super Bill would be replaced by his backup, James
Street, a 5' 11", 170-pound junior out of Longview, Texas. Everybody called
him Rat, short for River Rat, because on a team canoeing trip he had tipped
over and helplessly fought the cold water, terrified and panicking because
he didn't swim well. He wasn't half the athlete that Bradley was. "But he
was a competin' jackass," says Bellard. "He was wound up like a nine-day
clock." Street had finished the Texas Tech loss and injected some life into
the Texas offense in garbage time. There had been a little spark, and that
was enough of a catalyst for the change.
Four decades later James Street is a wealthy man, running The James
Street Group out of an office building in Austin. His company specializes in
structured settlements, arranging long-term disbursements to claimants in
personal injury and wrongful death cases. He is the father of five boys; the
oldest, Huston, is a major league pitcher, now the Colorado Rockies closer
and one of the game's best relievers. James
still walks and talks with the
jaunty confidence of a little man with something to prove. In 1968, he was
close friends with Bradley when he replaced him, and they remain close
friends to this day. Surely their friendship was cemented during the first
practice after the change.
"Monday after the Texas Tech game, we come out onto the field for practice,
and I'm nervous as hell," says Street. "Bradley comes out and lines up with the
split ends, because he's not a quarterback anymore. Everybody is kind of tight
because we're 0-1-1 and we've got a new quarterback. So Bradley lines up to
run a pattern and he unties his pants, so as soon as he starts running, his pants
fall down around his ankles. And that just broke the ice for everybody.
"Then we get to the next game, and we're playing Oklahoma State at
home," says Street. "Before the game Bradley stands up. He's the captain.
He tells everybody to be quiet and he says, 'All right, the Rat's gonna lead
us to victory today. We all gotta support the Rat.' He threw his full support
behind me that day, and it was big, because he was still Super Bill. What
55

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
he did that week, and every week after that, allowed me to do everything I
did." One more schematic change helped: Bellard and Royal moved Wor-
ster back one step, still in front of the halfbacks but not quite so close to the
line of scrimmage. It gave both Street and Worster a split second longer to
read the dive option, while keeping pressure on the defense.
All Street did was win every game he started, 20 in a row, from a 31-3
rout of Oklahoma State in that first week all the way through a 21-17 win
over Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl on New Year's Day in 1970. During
that stretch Texas averaged nearly 39 points a game and opponents floun-
dered trying to decipher the option attack. Street's decision-making was
flawless. Worster attacked the first option with abandon, often turning the
quick-hitting fullback dive into a long gain. Koy and Gilbert were perpetu-
ally loose on the corner, and just as Bellard had predicted, confusion and
missed assignments often left wide receiver Cotton Speyrer open deep. In
a 47-26 rout of Baylor in '68, Gilbert (212 yards), Worster (137) and Street
(108) all cracked the 100-yard mark. On New Year's Day 1969 in the Cot-
ton Bowl, the Longhorns trampled Tennessee 36-13 and finished the year
ranked No. 3 in the nation. And the next season would be even better.
After sputtering in a 17-0 season-opening win over California in Berke-
ley, Texas tore through eight consecutive opponents by an average margin
of nearly 37 points a game. Sophomore halfback Jim Bertelsen had seam-
lessly filled Gilbert's spot, and Street, Koy and Worster seemed to get slicker
with every game. On a raw afternoon in December in Fayetteville, Ark., the
No. 1-ranked Longhorns beat No. 2 Arkansas in the second so-called "Game
of the Century" in modern college football history. (The first had been three
years earlier, when No. 1 Notre Dame and No. 2 Michigan State had played
to a 10-10 tie.) The Texas-Arkansas matchup turned on a single play that is
central to the history of the sport and to the lore of the wishbone.
Trailing 14-8, Texas faced fourth-and-three on
its own 43-yard line.
Royal called Street to the sideline and shouted into the ear hole of his white
helmet: "53 Veer Pass." Street paused and looked at Royal. The coach re-
peated, more loudly, "53 Veer Pass" and sent Street back onto the field. It
was a fairly standard wishbone play that included a fullback ride to the
tight end (strong) side. Except on this play Street pulled the ball from Wor-
steds belly, dropped back five yards and threw deep up the seam to tight
end Randy Peschel, the only receiver in the pattern. The ball was thrown
56

THE WISHBONE
with perfect touch, and Peschel made a beautiful catch on a ball that came
directly over the top of his helmet in tight coverage. It was a 44-yard gain.
Two plays later Bertelsen scored the tying touchdown and Happy Feller
kicked the winning extra point. Even before Texas wrapped up its first na-
tional title since 1963, Street was a legend.
"You know what I'm known for, more than anything else in my life?"
says Street. "Fourth down and three, I could get it done. And I've lived my
whole life that way."
The ensuing spring was a once-in-a-lifetime whirlwind for Street. He met
John Wayne. He hung out with Elvis Presley. He turned down a chance to visit
former president Lyndon Johnson at his ranch because, says Street, "Shoot,
that sounded boring." Publications of the day kept referring to Street's side-
burns, as if his facial hair underscored his cool. "How lucky I had to be that
I was in the right place at the right time," Street says. "They changed the of-
fense, and it was new and it fit my style. And I take no credit. Hell, the first
time Emory showed it to me and Bradley in training camp, we said to each
other, 'What in the hell are they doing?' But it just took off, and for the rest of
my life I'm quote-unquote James Street and people treat me differently." (For
his part, Bill Bradley eventually moved from wide receiver to defensive back,
started the last few games of his senior year at Texas and played nine years in
the NFL, eight of them for the Philadelphia Eagles. Super Bill, indeed.)
It was at a 1990 reunion of the '69 Longhorns that Street connected with
billionaire Houston attorneyJoseph Jamail, an ardent supporter of their alma
mater. As Street tells it, Jamail said, "Street, I'm fixin' to buy some life insur-
ance;
I'll buy it from you." Soon thereafter, JamaiPs tax attorney introduced
Street to the world of structured settlements. Says Street, "I got lucky."
On the football field the Longhorns' wishbone didn't slow in Street's
absence. Eddie Phillips stepped in at quarterback, and Texas went 10-0 in
the 1970 regular season before losing a rematch with Notre Dame in the
Cotton Bowl on New Year's Day 1971. But by then the wishbone was already
sweeping through the sport like a Texas windstorm, being copied franti-
cally throughout the game.

They ran it out ofa wishbone variation calledthe I-bone, in which thefullback

As in the wishbone, the quarterback 'rides " thefullback into the middle and,
reading the reaction ofthe defensive tackle, decides whether to give the ball to

college game with its innovative attack. The wishbone worked. And it was
copied. Emory Bellard recalls that by the spring of 1970, a steady stream
of coaching staffs passed through Austin to watch the Horns practice and
then sit for a tutoring session on this fabulous new offense. "Around our
offices during spring training, you couldn't swing a stick without hitting
half a dozen coaches," says Bellard. "It was just unreal."
He found himself doing clinics on almost every off day, all over the South-
west. He wrote manuals to help coaching staffs teach the wishbone. If some
of those beseeching Bellard for his wisdom were seeking to emulate Texas's
domination—and, of course, some were—many were simply attracted to
the utilitarian qualities of the wishbone. It wasn't a power-based attack that
required offensive linemen to open holes with power drive blocks. Rather,
it used finesse blocking schemes in which linemen simply walled off their
defensive counterparts or slanted inside and blocked half their bodies. The
fact that two defenders were left unblocked and read by the quarterback
made it more attractive. Defenses were forced to play conservatively, care-
fully, making sure that all options were adequately defended. It was perilous

be copied. The football world
watched as Texas dominated the
59

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
to blitz, because wishbone plays often broke the first level of containment.
"All of a sudden," says Bellard, "every play can be a touchdown."
Darrell Royal would never forget these facets of the wishbone. In the sum-
mer of 1998, in the members' grill at the Barton Creek Country Club, where
Royal played golf in retirement, he was asked by a visitor to recall the spring
of '68, when the Texas wishbone altered the landscape of college football. It
was furnace-hot outside, and though the grill was air-conditioned to meat-
locker temperature, Royal was still flushed from his round in the sunshine.
He immediately began reaching over the black marble tabletop for con-
diment containers, arranging them with his gnarled, arthritic 74-year-old
hands. A salt shaker was the quarterback, ajar of mustard the fullback, bot-
tles of Tabasco sauce and ketchup a set of halfbacks. Royal rode his mustard
with the salt and then slid the glass vessel toward the edge of the table while
dragging his Tabasco halfback nearby, pushing it faster. Royal imagined de-
fenders trying to find the ball, trying to keep their responsibilities straight,
trying to play at full speed. "This will take care of those fancy pass rushers
straight away," he says, joyfully smacking the table with his open right hand.
Back in 1968, when the mustard was Steve Worster and the ketchup
was Chris Gilbert, a few onlookers were taking note of what Royal was
up to. One was Jim Brakefield, coach at Wofford College in Spartanburg,
S.C. When Brakefield had been an assistant at Wofford in the late '50s, the
team had included an undersized wingback named Fisher DeBerry. When
Brakefield became head coach, he made DeBerry, who'd been coaching
high school ball in South Carolina, an assistant. They installed the split-
back T formation, and Wofford endured four-win seasons in '67 and '68.
"People weren't real ecstatic about Jim's record those first two seasons,"
says DeBerry. "Well, Jim saw Texas play Tennessee in the Cotton Bowl after
the '68 season, and he liked what Texas was doing. We were already using
some real wide splits [between players] on the offensive line and running
some splitback Houston veer, and Jim thought maybe he could mesh that
with the Texas wishbone. Coach Royal sent up some film, and we studied
and decided to put it in."
The result was much as
it had been in Austin. Wofford lost the first
two games of the 1969 season and then won 20 straight. When Brakefield
moved to Appalachian State, he took DeBerry with him. They stayed nine
seasons before Ken Hatfield hired DeBerry to bring the wishbone to the
60

OPTION FEVER
Air Force Academy in 1980. Four seasons later DeBerry took over as head
coach, and for 23 years DeBerry's Air Force teams used the wishbone to
overcome a weekly deficit in size and speed. The Falcons won 169 games
and went to 12 postseason bowls, along with mixing in the occasional epic
upset, like the Beau Morgan-engineered victory over Notre Dame in 1996.
"Let's be frank," says DeBerry. "We had a system, and that system was
the wishbone. And that gave us a chance to win. We couldn't recruit the
same athletes as Colorado and Nebraska and Notre Dame. The wishbone
is an offense that's based on routine and repetition; and routine and rep-
etition are built into an Air Force Academy cadet's every day.
I think the
offense and academy go hand-in-glove." (The same was later true for Navy
and Army, each of which prospered with the wishbone and its hybrids.)
DeBerry did not stand pat. He was among the first coaches to widen—or
"break"—the wishbone by taking the halfbacks and lining them up as wing-
backs, outside and just behind the offensive tackle (or tight end). It was
called the flexbone, and it forced defenses to cover more options laterally—
clearly among the precursors to the spread offenses (Chapters 12-15) that
proliferated in the first decade of the new millennium. When Urban Meyer
was coaching at Utah, he sought out DeBerry for advice on the option of-
fense and later used a spread option to win two national titles at Florida
and turn quarterback Tim Tebow into a Heisman Trophy winner.
Wishbone growth was not limited to the small and outmanned. Among
the first coaches to approach Royal and Bellard was Paul (Bear) Bryant of
Alabama. Bryant had been ensconced in Tuscaloosa since 1958, and in the
eight years from '60 to '67, the Bear's teams lost only eight games and won
two national championships. But in '68, '69 and '70 Alabama lost a total
of 13 games, with back-to-back five-loss seasons. It appeared there was no
magic left in Bryant's houndstooth hat, and surely none in the pro-style pass-
ing game that was operated by his quarterback Scott Hunter. Bryant called
Royal and asked for help. Royal and Bellard went to Tuscaloosa and holed up
with Bryant and his staff in a hotel room, teaching the wishbone. The tutor-
ing session lasted for four days. In the ensuing '71 season, Alabama went 11-1.
From '71 to '79 the Tide rolled up a 97-11 record and won two national titles.
But there was another wishbone conversion that had far more impact
on college football. The Oklahoma Sooners were in transition through the
mid-1960s. Bud Wilkinson had retired his whistle after the '63 season.
61

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Gomer Jones went 9-11-1 in two seasons, was replaced by Jim Mackenzie,
whose team went 6-4 in '66 but was rocked when Mackenzie died sud-
denly of a heart attack after a spring practice in April '67 Mackenzie was
replaced by assistant Chuck Fairbanks—but the far greater influence would
come from a little-known offensive assistant named Barry Switzer.
Fairbanks's Sooners went 10-1 in 1967 but lost to one of Royal's four-loss
Texas teams; for the next three years Oklahoma fell to the Longhorn wish-
bone, including a 41-9 pasting in '70. OU had been using the two-back Hous-
ton veer, but Switzer had grown antsy watching Texas run its wishbone.
"We were struggling with the veer," says Switzer. "So now it's 1970, and
Texas is running up and down the field on everybody with the wishbone. So
I'm talking with Larry Lacewell, who's running our defense, and I'm say-
ing, 'Lacewell, this wishbone is what we should be doing. We've got a better
quarterback than James Street [Jack Mildren]. We've got Gregg Pruitt and
Joe Wylie. We've got better players than them." The racial element played
heavily in Switzer's thinking. The 1969 Texas Longhorns were the last all-
white national championship team; Switzer at the same time was recruit-
ing black players, which he viewed as a distinct advantage. "Darrell wasn't
even recruiting black athletes," says Switzer. "We were getting the best black
athletes out of Texas." In fact, they were getting many of the best white ath-
letes out of Texas too. Mildren was from Abilene and was white. Pruitt, who
would become a two-time All-America as one of the most dynamic wish-
bone halfbacks ever, was from Houston and was black.
After losing to Oregon State in the third game of the 1970 season, Okla-
homa had a week off. Switzer and Lacewell persuaded Fairbanks to work
in some wishbone plays for the upcoming Texas game. That was the 41-9
loss. "Texas kicked our asses pretty good," says Switzer, who became the
head coach in 1973. "But you could see we were getting better at it. And the
next year we kicked their asses."
Indeed, in 1971 Oklahoma ran the Longhorns into the ground, 48-27 In
one year they had become the most potent wishbone team in history. The
'71 Oklahoma Sooners would average 472.4 rushing yards per game, a re-
cord still comfortably standing in 2010. "We were having a track meet every
weekend, hanging half a hundred on everybody," says Switzer, invoking two
of his favorite wishbone phrases—track meet and half a hundred. Switzer's
teams seemed to play at a speed that was visibly faster than their opponents',

as a succession of wishbone quarterbacks and halfbacks laid waste to the
Big Eight and the nation. In his first 30 games as head coach, Switzer went
unbeaten; the Sooners wishbone would lose just 33 games over 18 years and
win three national championships, including in '74 and '75.
In a bizarre twist Oklahoma was hit with NCAA sanctions for recruit-
ing violations prior to '73 that were invoked during the '74 and '75 season;
the Sooners were banned from appearing on television in both seasons and
from playing in a bowl following the '74 season. All of this notoriety lent an
even more mythic air to the ripping Sooners wishbone, as if it were a slice
of cowboy folklore, and Switzer was the perfect black hat. In '74 he told SI,
"They can keep us offTV and ban us from the bowls, but nobody said that we
couldn't win and have some fun."
Looking back, Switzer says, "I had a great run, but
I'll tell you some-
thing: We had great players. For quarterbacks
I had Jack Mildren, Steve
Davis, Thomas Lott, J.C. Watts, Jamelle Holieway. For running backs I had
Kenny King,Joe Washington, Billy Sims, Horace Ivory, Elvis Peacock. Great,
great players. And with the wishbone, they couldn't stop us."
What is most remarkable is that Texas gave the wishbone to the archrival
Sooners. After being routed by Texas in that 1970 game, Fairbanks called Royal
and asked for help. The Sooners had picked up the big strokes of the wishbone
from film but needed work with the subtleties. Royal was an Oklahoma alum-
nus, with some lingering loyalty to the Crimson and Cream. He called Bellard.
"Emory," he said, "Chuck Fairbanks is gonna lose his job up there if they
don't do something about their offense, so I want to help him out. Barry
Switzer is gonna be calling, and I want you to tell him whatever they need
to know to put in the wishbone."
Bellard was stunned. As much as he had been willing to help other
teams, the thought of handing over his prized weapon to the rival Sooners
was too much to swallow. "Darrell, you gotta be joking," said Bellard.
"Nope," said Royal. "I'm just as dead serious as I can be."
Royal was the boss. Bellard backed down. Switzer called a week later
and kept on calling for several months. "Anytime he had a question about
what to do in a certain situation or against some defense, he would just call
me right up," says Bellard. "We gave the whole thing to 'em."
Nearly four decades later Switzer insists the Sooners would have figured it
out anyway. "Aw, sure, they helped us a little bit," he says. "But Emory had done
63

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
a bunch of lectures, and we had all the Texas film, so it's not like there were a lot
of secrets. By the time the 1971 season came around, our offense had it rolling,
and we just about changed college football for the next 20 years or so."
After turning the wishbone over to his alma mater, Darrell Royal never
beat the Sooners again as a head coach, losing every year from 1971 to '75
before salvaging a 6-6 tie in '76, his last year as coach of the Longhorns.
More than 20 years later, in the summer of 2007, Bellard and Royal got
together for an afternoon, two old coaches trading stories. In the middle of
it all, Royal turned to his old assistant and said, "Emory, if I had it to do all
over again, I probably wouldn't have been so benevolent."
Among the many coaches casting his eyes to the Southwest was Lou
Holtz, who was hired as a 32-year-old in 1969 as head coach at William &
Mary. He had been an assistant with Woody Hayes's powerhouse program
at Ohio State and rolled into Williamsburg, Va., intent on running a little of
everything on offense. His first team went 3-7, and in spring meetings he
began studying an option offense that coach Jimmy (Red) Parker had once
used at Arkansas A&M and The Citadel. It fascinated Holtz and, even better,
it looked to him like a lifeline.
"Going into our second year at William and Mary, I sat down with my
staff and said, 'O.K., let's list our assets,' " says Holtz. "We had a fine center.
We didn't have a running back who'd gained a yard in a varsity game. We had
one receiver who had caught three passes. On the offensive line we had prob-
lems everywhere but center. I said, 'How are we going to move the ball?'
Replied his assistant, Larry Beightol, "If I were you, I'd just worry about
making sure it doesn't go backward."
Holtz installed the wishbone and won the Southern Conference title in 1970
and went to the Tangerine Bowl. Two years later he began a four-year run as
head coach at North Carolina State and took the Wolfpack to four consecutive
bowls. Holtz coached 26 more years at four schools and always kept the op-
tion at the core of his offense, always forcing opponents to prepare to defend it,
even if some Saturdays he chose not to run even a single option play.
When Holtz took his dream job at Notre Dame in 1986, he commit-
ted wholly to the option game. The problem was that, initially, he didn't
have an option quarterback, having inherited senior Steve Beuerlein from
previous coach Gerry Faust's failed regime. Beuerlein would play 14 years
and start 102 games in the NFL, but at a statuesque 6' 3", 220 pounds, he
64

OPTION FEVER
was glacially slow. Holtz tried to run the option just the same, instructing
Beuerlein never to keep the ball. In a summer practice he kept the ball on
an option play and ran 20 yards upheld and was stunned to see Holtz chas-
ing him from behind. "Steve Beuerlein, don't you ever run the ball again!"
screamed Holtz. "You see that fast guy behind you? He's the runner. Pitch
the ball to him and get out of the way."
A year later Beuerlein had been replaced by Tony Rice, a quarterback
Barry Switzer would have loved: quick, strong, decisive and, just to further
torment defenses, with a strong arm to exploit the deep defensive third of
the field. Rice led Notre Dame to the national championship in 1988 and
to the No. 2 national ranking a year later when the Irish knocked off previ-
ously unbeaten Colorado 21-6 in the Orange Bowl.
That win was significant because one year later Colorado would share
the national championship running an I formation hybrid of the wishbone
installed by offensive coordinator Gerry DiNardo under head coach Bill
McCartney. That championship came nine years after McCartney was hired
and five years after switching to the wishbone's cousin, the I-bone. "And I
certainly think it was done out of desperation," says DiNardo.
Colorado had gone 7-25-1 in McCartney's first three seasons. "Bill wanted
to throw the ball, so we threw the ball," says DiNardo. "I remember the head-
line in the Boulder Daily Camera said something like BUFFS WILL BE THE
BYU OF THE BIG EIGHT. Even as we started to recruit better players, we still
couldn't win. To me, from an analytical perspective, we were throwing too
much on first-and-10. That's such an important down. It's the only neutral
down in football. It's the only down where the defense has to defend every-
thing. But we were throwing so much on first-and-10 that even against equal
talent like Kansas and Kansas State—we were bad, they were bad—we were
constantly in second-and-10. And second-and-10 favors the defense.
"So we started looking around at what other people were doing of-
fensively," says DiNardo. "And we are absolutely desperate. At that point,
we're talking 1984, you've got Lou Holtz running a form of the wishbone at
Minnesota. You've got Oklahoma with Switzer and Larry Lacewell. You've
got Jim Wacker at TCU, Ken Hatfield at Arkansas and, of course, you've
got Fisher DeBerry at Air Force. So after all those years of second-and-10,
we've got to find a way to get four yards on first down. Well, we felt like
if we read the triple option correctly, it was pretty much unstoppable for
65

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
four yards on first down. So we put it in for 1985 and sold our kids on the
theory that if we could play first-and-10, second-and-six, third-and-two
and stay on schedule 50 percent of the time, we would win every game.
And it darn near worked out that way."
Not at first. DiNardo met with DeBerry, Hatfield and Lacewell in the
winter of 1985 and installed the option at spring practice. He took the
practice tape to Lacewell to view during a national coaches' convention.
When DiNardo walked out of the room with his tape, Lacewell said to his
fellow coaches, "I feel bad. They'll be lucky to win a game." The transi-
tion was comically painful. DiNardo recalls a preseason gathering in Den-
ver with a booster club. One of the gentlemen in the audience stood up
and, having heard of the conversion to the wishbone, said to McCartney,
"Please tell me the first play of the season isn't going to be a dive up the
middle, because I don't think I can stand that."
McCartney let the question hang and then answered: "You might want
to come for the second play."
With athletes recruited to play a passing game, the Buffaloes improved
from 1-10 in '84 to 7-5 in '85 to 8-4 in '88, settting the stage for a two-year
run at the national title. "The switch to the wishbone allowed us all to keep
our jobs long enough to start recruiting players," says DiNardo. They did
exactly that, picking up the quicksilver quarterback Darian Hagan, a clas-
sic, tough and slippery wishbone QB, and running backs Eric Bieniemy and
J.J. Flannigan. In their prime the Buffaloes ran their option from an I-bone,
with two backs directly behind the quarterback and the second (lead block-
ing) halfback offset to the side, which DiNardo felt give him a better angle to
throw a load block on the corner.
Colorado won 11 straight before losing to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl
following the '89 season and beat the Irish a year later, 10-9, to earn a piece
of the title with Georgia Tech. "Not only did we stop a very bad slide, but we
won a national championship," says DiNardo. "Which is pretty good."
Nebraska's option offense won three national titles, in 1994, '95 and '97
(shared with Michigan). That number could easily have been five had it not
been for one failed two-point conversion in the '84 Orange Bowl and an
upset loss in the '96 Big 12 championship game. For all of the success that
Texas and Oklahoma achieved in the '70s and '80s, Nebraska's I formation-
based option attack was arguably the most innovative and surely one of the
66

OPTION FEVER
most effective in the game's history. Unlike many of his peers, Nebraska
coach Tom Osborne did not turn to the option out of desperation—in his
case it was out of frustration.
In a 25-year head coaching career that began in 1973 when he was se-
lected to replace his mentor, Bob Devaney, Osborne won nearly 84% of his
games and never won fewer than nine in a season. "But we had trouble
with Oklahoma," he says. "And I really came to admire what they did with
option football." In Osborne's first eight years at Nebraska his teams lost a
total of 20 games; however, they beat Oklahoma only once.
In 1981 Osborne installed an I-based option. "I didn't want to leave the
I and go to the wishbone entirely," says Osborne. "We still liked the idea of
having a great runner back there who could run the ball at any point on the
field. Oklahoma had Billy Sims ['75, '77-79] in a wishbone, and he was a
great player, but he was a little limited in how much he could carry the ball
because of where he lined up."
The Nebraska I option (or I-bone) was an immediate success, largely be-
cause of three-year starting quarterback Turner Gill, who had been the object
of a furious recruiting war while a quarterback at Arlington Heights High
in Fort Worth. "The biggest mistake I ever made in coaching was taking for
granted that Turner Gill was coming to Oklahoma," says Switzer. "February
1980, I'm fighting my ass off for a linebacker. I get a call from Turner Gill. He
puts a stake in my heart and tells me he's going to Nebraska. So not only do I
lose him, but I lose him to Nebraska, and I gotta play their ass!"
With Gill operating the Nebraska attack, the Cornhuskers went 12-1 in
both 1982 and '83 and narrowly lost the '83 national title when Osborne fa-
mously played for a winning two-point conversion and lost to Miami 31-30
in the Orange Bowl. Not long after, the balance of power in the Big Eight
would shift back to Oklahoma and, briefly, to McCartney and Colorado, al-
ways with the wishbone or some form of the triple option as the basis of
the offense. But through the middle of the '90s, Osborne sped the evolution
of Emory Bellard's old game, stringing together a series of innovations and
nearly landing four consecutive national titles. Among Osborne's variations:
• Pulling tackles and guards from the back side of the play to trap aggressive
defenders—such as gap-blitzing linebackers, who had become a popular
defensive answer to the triple option—and creating new seams in the de-
fense. (Even the NFL was watching; Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs
67

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
[Chapter 7] would later credit Osborne with birthing the blocking schemes
that led to the development of the Counter Trey running play that the Skins
rode to Super Bowl victories at the end of the 1987 and '91 NFL seasons.)
• Creating plays in which the quarterback follows a lead blocker, instead
of optioning off of unblocked defenders. Tommie Frazier (1992-95), Scott
Frost ('96 and '97) and 2001 Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch (1998-
2001) all flourished in the system.
• Running option plays with the quarterback in a shotgun formation. Os-
borne, who like so many of his peers is loath to claim invention of anything,
says, "That one, running the option out of the shotgun, I think we were at
least one of the first teams to try that. We got a lot of ideas from the service
academies and from Oklahoma. With them, we had them on the ropes in a
number of games over the years, and their quarterbacks would make a great
play to get them back in contention. We wanted to develop some things where
our quarterbacks could make plays like that."
Switzer says, "Here's what Tom did: He has the quarterback read the
tackle, like always. Now, the linebacker is watching that read, but he doesn't
know the tailback is hauling ass right behind the fullback and he's going to
block the linebacker. Right when that happens, the quarterback ducks into
that seam, and the first guy with a shot at him is the three-deep safety. Tom
got teams in fourth-and-three, and he'd go for
it, and by then I'm out of
college coaching and I'm watching on TV, and I would just start laughing
my ass off because they don't know what's about to hit 'em. Next thing you
know, the Nebraska quarterback is running 50 yards untouched."
By the turn ofthe century, though, the wishbone (and all forms ofthe triple
option) had all but vanished from the college game. Recruiting was clearly a
factor, as the option became stigmatized as failing to prepare star players for
the pro game. "The wishbone in particular became a service-academy of-
fense because the major programs running it could no longer successfully re-
cruit the great quarterback, the great running back, the great left tackle," says
DiNardo. "When we were running it at Colorado, I can't tell you how many
programs beat us up in recruiting by telling kids, 'You won't be able to play
in the NFL because you won't be learning the passing game.' And eventually
most of the option teams just caved in, and it gradually went away."
In related fashion, and just as significantly, there was a rush to install
spread offenses and numerous other throwing systems. Eventually they, too,
68

OPTION FEVER
would incorporate option principles. But as for the pure wishbone, its prac-
titioners dwindled to a precious few. One of them was Paul Johnson, a North
Carolinian who was at his third assistant coaching stop at age 27 when he
was named offensive coordinator at NCAA Division I-AA Georgia Southern
in the spring of 1985. He had played on a wishbone team in high school and
had watched on Saturday afternoons as Oklahoma tore up the midlands and
Alabama the South with the wishbone. "Here was the biggest thing for me,"
says Johnson. "When I was on defense, I thought the option was really hard
to defend well, if it was run right. So I wanted to run it." In his two years at
Georgia Southern, his offense averaged 36 points a game and won 26 of 30.
Ten years laterJohnson was back at Georgia Southern with his first head
coaching position, and he wishboned—flexboned, really—the Southern
Conference and all of Division I-AA into submission. In five years the Eagles
went 62-10, won two national titles and five conference championships.
True to early wishbone strategy, defending it left Georgia Southern's op-
ponents susceptible to the passing game. "Some of those teams, we scored
50 points a game for stretches, and our guys were playing half the game,"
says Johnson. "We could have scored 70 every game if we wanted to."
It galled Johnson then, and it galls him now, that the wishbone fell into
such disfavor and was so roundly criticized, like fashion worn a year too
long. To his mind, it never stopped working. Coaches just stopped using it
because something else was available. "All of a sudden there was this stig-
ma attached to it, that you're not supposed to use it anymore," says John-
son. "Well, why not? I think it's because some of those really strong Miami
teams beat some Oklahoma option teams by throwing the ball. And that
was about it. Then they would say it's an offense for overmatched teams,
when you don't have equal talent. At Georgia Southern we had equal or bet-
ter talent than the team we were playing, and we went 62-10."
Ironically, Johnson would prove the overmatched theory in his next job.
In 2002 Johnson became head coach at Navy. The Midshipmen went 2-10
in Johnson's first year and then 43-19 in the next five. That got him hired at
Georgia Tech late in 2007, where he promised to bring the wishbone back to
major-college football. In his first season at Georgia Tech, in 2008, the Yel-
low Jackets finished 9-4 and Johnson was named ACC Coach of the Year;
in 2009, he finished 11-3— all the while running the triple option. He kept
his promise. The 'bone still had some pop in it.

Pasadena, Calif.
February 1, 1993
ORV TURNER woke up
on a Monday morning
in possession of a Super
Bowl title. As offensive
coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys he had called plays the previous night
in the Rose Bowl, guiding the Cowboys to a 52-17 rout of the Buffalo Bills.
Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman had thrown four touchdown passes to
three receivers and had been named the game's most valuable player.
The game would occupy an important place on the NFL time line: A sto-
ried franchise, and one of the league's most recognizable brand names, the
Cowboys had returned to greatness following a decade of mediocrity and just
three years after jarring change—most notably the ouster of beloved found-
ing head coach Tom Landry by new oilman owner Jerry Jones. The victory
would launch a minidynasty, as Dallas won three Super Bowls in four years.
The game was equally significant in another way. It had showcased Aik-
man and a Dallas passinggame thatwould become an NFL staple throughout
the '90s. On a warm California evening Aikman had peppered the Buffalo
defense with scoring passes: a 23-yard touchdown to tight end Jay Nova-
cek running straight up the middle of the Buffalo defense; a 19-yard slant
score to Michael Irvin slashing diagonally across the field; another 18-yard
touchdown to Irvin, planted at the right sideline; and, finally, a 45-yard
71

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
bomb to Alvin Harper, wide-open far beyond the deepest Buffalo defender.
In front of his TV at his home in San Francisco, former Chargers quar-
terback Dan Fouts had watched Aikman's precision like a man staring in a
mirror. On the morning after the game he called Turner, offered congratu-
lations and then said, "O.K., let me see if I got this right
" Fouts then
recited the play calls on each of Aikman's four touchdowns, as if he had
been standing in the Cowboys' huddle.
"Dan's on the phone, and he just runs down the calls," recalls Turner.
"He's like, 'The first touchdown was 370, right? Then the second one was
839? The third one looked to me like 787 special. And then the last one
was 989.' I can't remember the exact calls, but Dan remembered them back
then. Perfectly. He called every single play, exactly." On the phone Turner
had laughed out loud and Fouts laughed back, two men linked across time
by another man's lasting genius.
Fouts had been a 27-year-old quarterback for the Chargers in Sep-
tember of 1978 when team owner Eugene V. Klein forced head coach
Tommy Prothro's resignation and replaced him with a 53-year-old coach
named Don Coryell. He had built winners at San Diego State and with the
St. Louis Cardinals by installing an inventive, pass-first offensive system
that attacked defenses as few others had before it. Eight years later Turner,
who had come to the Los Angeles Rams from USC in 1985 as an offensive
assistant coach, found himself working under Ernie Zampese, who had
worked under Coryell with the Chargers. Fouts and Turner shared a pas-
sion for what came to be known simply as the Coryell offense, and they
shared a fluency in its language.
Fouts rode the Coryell offense into the Hall of Fame, directing the explo-
sive Chargers attack that redefined offense through the 1980s. Turner took
Coryell 101 to Dallas and taught it to Aikman and Irvin and the rest. There
were many other Coryell disciples, and there would be many more in the
years that followed, all because a former Army paratrooper turned football
coach got sick of losing two games a year to deeper teams while coaching at
San Diego State in the 1960s. So he built an offense that combined techni-
cal simplicity with daring downfield strikes written into almost every play.
Pass routes were numbered in a basic 1 through 9 ladder. Quarterbacks
were instructed to read from deep to short and to get rid of the ball quick-
ly. Formations with four wide receivers became common, and eventually,
72

AIR CORYELL
players in motion became routine. On defense, an entire sport backpedaled.
Mike Martz watched Coryell's San Diego State teams while he was
playing tight end at San Diego Mesa (Junior) College in the late 1960s. ("I
pictured myself playing for Don, but I wasn't good enough," says Martz.)
Three decades later, in 1999, Martz became offensive coordinator of the
St. Louis Rams and directed an explosive offense to the Super Bowl title.
Because they played home games indoors on artificial grass, the Rams
came to be called The Greatest Show on Turf, but in truth it was just the
Coryell offense, evolved. During the height of the Rams' success, Martz
met up with Coryell, and the two were photographed together. Martz
later sent the photo to Coryell with the following inscription:
Coach Coryell, we are allgrateful toyouforyour impact on the game.
You changed itforever.
.
.
. the 'Godfather' of today's passing game.
"And he is exactly that," says Martz. "He was way ahead of everyone in
terms of innovation. There was this unspoken set of rules that you played
by on offense. And everyone was running generally the same kind of
plays. The formations were the same. The concepts were the same. Cory-
ell changed all that. People immediately said, 'You can't do that.' Well, you
can do that, and he did it. His whole approach to the game was different.
He was going to beat you with the ball at any time. He had this aggressive
mind-set. He was always attacking the defense, never going into this con-
servative mode where you try to win through attrition. And that's where
football was at that time in history. Now, 40 years later, you're seeing the
second and third generations of coaches running Coryell's system."
The recent history of the NFL is rich with success descended from the
Coryell offense. Zampese won with it in Los Angeles. Joe Gibbs, who played
for Coryell at San Diego State and also coached under him, took the play-
book to Washington, expanded it and won three Super Bowls. Turner took it
to Dallas, then Washington, then San Diego. Martz turned the league upside
down in St. Louis. Jason Garrett (Aikman's erstwhile backup) called Coryell's
plays into Tony Romo's helmet as the Cowboys' offensive coordinator. Play-
ers have been made famous by running signature patterns in the offense: Ir-
vin on the Bang 8 slant; Jay Novacek, then Marshall Faulk and most recently
Antonio Gates on the F post.

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
By the start of the 2008 NFL season, there was scarcely a team in the
league that didn't incorporate some piece of the Coryell passing game into
its offense, whether by the numbering of pass routes or spacing concepts or
individual plays. By 2010 several teams—most notably Baltimore, Dallas, San
Diego and San Francisco—relied almost exclusively on the Coryell offense.
"Ifyou brought Don Coryell to Dallas and handed him our playbook," said
Garrett in the fall of 2007, "without ever having watched one of our practices
or games, he would still recognize an awful lot of stuff in that book."
Puget Sound, Wash.
March 2008
THE WORD coming through the football pipeline was that Don Coryell,
83 years old, had become a recluse, living a quiet life far from the main-
stream, resistant to questioners and in poor health. Some of this, it turns
out, is true: Coryell resides far from the noise of Sunday afternoons and
has done few interviews in recent years. He has slowed with age. But he
is not a recluse. It's just that inquisitors must go to him, and even in a
world made small, that is not easy.
It is a 66-mile drive north on Interstate 5 from Seattle to Burlington,
and then 16 miles west on Route 20 from Burlington to Anacortes, a stag-
ing point for many of the ferries that service the San Juan Islands float-
ing at the nexis of Washington State, Canada's Vancouver Island and the
Olympic Peninsula. From a pier in Anacortes, one boat stops first at Lopez
Island and then continues on 20 minutes later to Friday Harbor, a village
of 2,200 year-round residents, the only incorporated town on San Juan
Island, the second largest in the chain. A late-model SUV slows to a stop
along Front Street, parallel to the shoreline, with Coryell at the wheel.
The old coach wears a heavy fleece pullover, baggy sweat-style pants and
walking shoes. A baseball cap covers thin gray hair, his blue eyes are full of
vigor. He is slender in the manner of a former athlete, but he also explains
that a recent knee replacement has left him hobbling, and he has a set of
hiking poles in the backseat to prove it. The ride is 25 minutes over rolling,
pastoral hills and sweeping roadway curves from downtown Friday Harbor
to Coryell's home across the island, a three-story natural wood house over-
looking a peaceful, horseshoe-shaped inlet called Neil Bay. Coryell and his
74

AIR CORYELL
wife, Aliisa (who died in December 2008), bought the home while he was
still coaching in the NFL; he now lives there year-round.
The drive across the island is plenty long enough for Coryell to unfurl the
story of his life: raised in Seattle, played football at Lincoln High School, en-
listed in the Army in 1943 and spent 3/2 years as a paratrooper. He returned
to Seattle and the University ofWashington in the fall of 1946 and played de-
fensive back for the Huskies. "I wasn't good enough to play offense," he says.
"Even on defense, I think I started one game, and that was in my senior year."
He also began sliding, almost accidentally, toward his calling.
"I started out as a forestry major," says Coryell. "I wanted to be a forest
ranger. But there was a lot of science, and there was no way I could get
through all that science. So I withdrew before I flunked out and switched
over to physical education." He graduated in the spring of 1950, and af-
ter getting a master's degree from Washington in physical education, em-
barked on what was another of those classic coaching odysseys: two years
at high schools in Hawaii, two years as head coach at the University of
British Columbia, a year at Wenatchee Valley College in Washington State,
a year coaching a military team at Fort Ord in Northern California; three
years as head coach at Whittier College in suburban L.A. and a year on John
McKay's staff at USC before taking over at San Diego State in 1961.
At every stop Coryell tinkered. "You look at your players, and you fig-
ure out what the hell they can do," he says. Coryell had been a single
wing quarterback in high school. In 1955 Wenatchee's lone outstanding
running back was injured during the preseason. "We took one of our full-
backs and put him at tailback. The other fullback played fullback, right
in front of the halfback. We called it our hash marks offense because we'd
use it on the hash marks and put the other halfback to the wide side. For
us, it was backs-left and backs-right."
Football historians call it something else: The power I. It would come
to dominate college football in the 1970s (including at USC, where Coryell
had worked with McKay). As with so many football creations, its precise
origins are unclear. It might have been Frank Leahy at Notre Dame in the
early 1950s or Tom Nugent at Virginia Military Institute in the middle of
the decade who first ran the formation. But Coryell was certainly one of its

with the possibility of expanding his offense and read a book by TCU ath-
letic director and coach Dutch Meyer titled Spread Formation Football. In
his third year at Whittier, Coryell moved a tailback to quarterback, spread
out his wide receivers and began throwing passes.
Whittier went 23-5-1 in Coryell's three years. After his one season at USC
he was hired to salvage football at San Diego State, winner ofjust seven games
in the previous four seasons. Coryell made the Aztecs better immediately,
winning 38 games in his first five seasons. Yet they also lost two games a
year, and it was those losses that galled Coryell. "Two games, every goddam
year," he says. He was scouring California junior colleges for players who had
escaped the grasp of USC and UCLA, but still San Diego State usually found
itself with a talent deficit against major-college programs. But not a skill defi-
cit. Coryell concluded that the best way to win was to make full use of quar-
terbacks and wide receivers and beat more complete teams with the pass.
"I just decided, hell, you can't just go out and run the ball against better
teams," he says. "You've got to mix it up. You've got to throw the damn ball
if you're going to beat better teams. So we started throwing the ball."
Joe Gibbs played at San Diego State during Coryell's first three seasons
and was an assistant coach for the next three. "When
I first came there
in 1961," Gibbs says, "Don was a killer running coach. I formation, power
running. Just killer. But then
it's amazing the transition that took place.
Don switched to throwing it like mad, and he was very creative. He was not
afraid to try anything."
Over the next six seasons San Diego State was 55-9-1, becoming a national
phenomenon, forcing recognition by pounding nonelite opponents, but forc-
ing fans and media to wonder just how good they might be. "USC or UCLA
might be wise to steer clear of the Aztecs," wrote SPORTS ILLUSTRATED in
October 1966. SDSU sometimes drew more fans than the Chargers, who
were then a power in the American Football League. Among Coryell's as-
sistant coaches were Gibbs, Zampese and John Madden.
The recognition all came on the wings of the passing game, though the
conversion was gradual: In 1961, Coryell's first year, San Diego State quar-
terbacks threw a total of 124 passes; three years later it was 250. In 1964, se-
nior Rod Dowhower (later head coach at Stanford and with the Indianapolis
Colts) led a passing attack that accounted for 2,083 yards (nearly double the
'61 total). Junior flanker Gary Garrison (who would become an AFL Ail-Star
76

AIR CORYELL
with the Chargers) caught 78 passes in '64 and 70 more from Don Horn a
year later, with a total of 26 touchdowns. Haven Moses, Ken Burrow and
Isaac Curtis would follow Garrison's tracks into pro football. At quarterback,
Dennis Shaw followed Horn, and Brian Sipe followed Shaw; all played in the
NFL, as did at least two dozen other of Coryell's San Diego State players.
That was just the beginning. Coryell would guide the St. Louis Cardinals
to two divisional titles in the brutal NFC East and the Chargers to two divi-
sional championships in the AFC West. So how, exactly, did he do it?
ON THAT chilly winter afternoon in 2008 Coryell sits at the dining table
in his waterfront home, ignoring a fruit and cheese plate as he becomes
absorbed
in
explaining
his
offense. From
a canvas shopping bag he
pulls a thick, three-ring binder, a small index card affixed to the front:
SAN DIEGO CHARGERS: 1979. "Right here," Coryell says, smacking the
front of the binder with his right hand, the one adorned with a ring from
the College Football Hall of Fame. "This is how we did it."
Football historians often point out that Coryell created his modern, ef-
fective game at the same time Sid Gillman was coaching the Chargers and
using a daring air offense with quarterback John Hadl and receivers Lance
Alworth and Garrison. It has been suggested, more than once, that Coryell
devised his offense after watching Gillman's. Coryell says it's not so. "Sid
Gillman threw it down the field, and I probably watched Sid's teams," says
Coryell. Then he smacks the binder again. "But this is our stuff."
Coryell's offensive system is based on three elements: simplicity, spac-
ing and timing.
It is unclear which early sideline mavens first used numbers, rather than
names, to identify pass routes. What is unquestioned is that Coryell's num-
bering system has been the most enduring and efficient. The foundation:
Routes for the outside receivers in a formation (typically designated the X
and Z receivers) are assigned single digits, from 1 to 9; routes for an inside
(or Y) receiver are assigned multiples of 10, from 10 to 90. A basic pass play
might begin with the number 837, which means the outside X receiver runs
an 8 route, the inside Y receiver runs a 30, and the outside Z receiver runs a 7.
Coryell flips through pages in the binder until he arrives at a page en-
titled "Routes for X and Y." Half the page is filled with a basic diagram
showing half an offensive line and a single wide receiver. A series of lines
77

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
emanates from the lone wideout, each one numbered. Below the diagram
is a key, with a description of each route, in intricate detail. The numbering
system would become not only intrinsic to the offensive language of the
sport but also to the lexicon of the broadcast booth.
Here are some examples, for the X and Z receivers, which can be split
ends or flankers: A 1 route is a basic out. A 2 is a hard slant. A 6 is a curl. An
8 (or a "Bang 8," with which Aikman and Irvin would get rich and famous
in Dallas) is a skinny post. A 9 is a go route, or fly pattern.
The route descriptions are precise. For instance, from the list of routes for
the Y receiver, which can be a slot player, tight end or running back, a 20 is
explained like this: "Release inside and sprint across field aiming for 7 YD
depth on the other side of formation." This is essentially what became know
as a "drag" route, or in the West Coast offense (Chapter 8), a "drive" route.
Coryell created the numbering system for two reasons. The first is that
it was easy to learn quickly. At San Diego State, Coryell relied so heavily on
junior college players, who would only be available to him for two seasons,
that quick study was a necessity. "You can get a guy and teach him the
whole thing in two days," says Coryell.
Cam Cameron, who learned the system as Turner's quarterbacks coach
with the Redskins, says, "At the NFL level, one of the highest compliments
you can give the system is that you can bring new guys in on Tuesday and
they can play on Sunday."
The second reason—a key explanation for the longevity of the Coryell
system—is that the numbering system
is
visual, rather than cognitive.
Whereas many prior, and subsequent, offensive systems would give each
play a word name (Cowboy or Maverick or some such), the backbone of
every Coryell play is a two- or three-digit number that doesn't just name the
play but also describes what the play will look like. A play with the number
335 shows that the X receiver is running a deep out (3), the Z receiver is
running a comeback (5) and the Y receiver is also running a deep out (30).
Even in the Coryell system, further word and letter additions are neces-
sary to describe formations and routes for the running backs (labeled H
and F), as in Scat (formation) 435 F Cross (an inside crossing route by a
running back). But every play is built from the foundation of the digits.
"It was always a great thing for me," says quarterback Trent Green, who
played in the Coryell system for Turner in Washington and later for Mike
78

AIR CORYELL
Martz in St. Louis. "The first thing I do when a play comes into my headset
is visualize it. In this system, with every play call, you're actually telling ev-
erybody what to do by what you say. Instead of saying, 'I Right Omaha,' or
something like that, you're saying, 'R 428 H Stop,' and that tells everybody
what to do, instead of relying on their memorization of something."
As Joe Gibbs puts it, "Using Don's offense, you felt like the quarterback
had a picture in his mind of what was going to happen. If everybody in the
huddle shut their eyes, they could all see the play, much more than just
learning a name by rote."
Jason Garrett, who installed the system as coordinator of the Cowboys in
2007, says, "To me, there was so much simplicity in the way it's taught and
the way it's learned. And that goes back to the three-digit system of digitiz-
ing the routes. Putting the whole passing game together is just a matter of
putting the numbers together. It all flows so naturally."
The spacing element of the Coryell offense—in which every route is
designed to maximize distance receivers, making them more difficult to
cover—has its roots in the Dutch Meyer book that Coryell studied. "It's one
of the huge keys to the entire offense—the spacing is just so important,"
says quarterback Kurt Warner, who operated the system for the Rams. "It's
so emphasized to all the receivers: Get off the ball and get downfield, get
great separation between your deep route and your six- to eight-yard route.
The entire offense is very precise, and it comes down to spacing more than
anything else, spreading out the defense." If the Coryell system is executed
properly, as with any spread-style offense, defenders are forced to cover
huge chunks of earth to blanket receivers.
The final component was timing; from the early days Coryell harped
on the wedding of speed and precision. "We put a timing element on every
one of the routes," says Zampese. "Say we were asking the X receiver to run
a 1 route. We would tell the guy, 'Three steps, and when your third inside
foot hits the ground, that's when you break! Just go ahead and change
direction. No fakes, just timing. Third inside foot and break.' And the key
was to run as fast as you can. Which we forced these guys to do. We told
them not to round off their cuts, but we had them running the routes so
fast that they had to round them off a little bit."
Just as important was the speed of the quarterback. Anyone who has
played in the Coryell system can still hear an assistant coach—Zampese,
79

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Turner, Cameron, Garrett—screaming in a quarterback's ear as he drops
back from the center: Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!
"Urgency is
critical," says Garrett. "If I heard Norv Turner and Ernie
Zampese say it once to the wide receivers, I heard them say it 500,000 times:
'Run off the ball! Run off the ball! Get out ofyour stance and get going! ' And it
applies to the quarterback. 'Get out! Get away from the center! Get your back
foot down and get rid of the ball!' Can you teach a guy this? I don't know, but
I'll tell you this: It's going to be ground into the head of any guy running this
system. Bang, bang, bang! Get the ball out. Over and over again."
The most obvious "Gillmanesque" quality in Coryell's system is its every-
down homage to the deep ball, the way Sid liked to play. Nearly every play
in Coryell's book includes some sort of downfield option, and quarterbacks
are taught to read plays from deep to short—whereas many offenses read
short to deep or some sort of other predesigned progression. "On Don's pass
routes, normally there were three different parts to the route," says Gibbs.
"And there's always a deep portion. And you'd have a medium portion and
a short checkdown. Don's reads [for the quarterback] would always start
with the deep shot, so you didn't have to guess and gamble by calling a
specific deep shot. It was already there, built into all the routes."
Coryell drilled two other credos into his quarterbacks' heads: 1) "Never
pass up an open receiver. If he's there, stop reading and throw it to him."
2) "Never, ever worry about an incompletion. You don't give a damn about
incompletions. Just go back and get it the next time."
When Coryell arrived in St. Louis in 1973, his first move was to re-
store 29-year-old, eight-year veteran Jim Hart as the starting quarterback.
Hart was the classic Coryell QB: durable and decisive, with a quick re-
lease. "Don came into St. Louis and looked at film on Jim Hart," says Jim
Hanifan, who came to the Cardinals with Coryell from San Diego State.
"Jimmy had been sitting on the bench. Don looked at the film and said,
'Screw that. This is my quarterback.' "
Coryell gave Hart one order: "Don't get hit." (Translation: Get rid of the
ball.) The Cardinals took a year to master Coryell's system and then won
31 games in three years, including two divisional titles. Coryell expanded
his offense, adding multiple formations and putting in several screen pass-
es to best utilize his speedy little running back, Terry Metcalf. In 1974 and
'76 Hart led the NFC in touchdown passes.
80

AIR CORYELL
"Back in those years," says Hanifan, "a lot of teams would just sit back
on defense and Don would feast on them. So they started to bring pres-
sure, and Don would just say, 'We are not going to let this happen. We're
going to attack.'
Gibbs, also a Coryell assistant in St. Louis, says, "I'd be up in the press
box calling plays, and Don would grab the headset and he'd say, 'Let's start
getting after their butts!' Usually that means pound it down their throats,
but with Don it meant 'Let's start throwing it.' Not running it on them, get-
ting after them by throwing it."
Four games into the 1978 season, the Chargers hired Coryell as head
coach. Coryell, who had returned to San Diego after the Cardinals let him
go (St. Louis's owner got antsy after a 7-7 season in '77), was introduced
to the Charger players on the morning of Monday, Sept. 25, 1978, one day
after a 24-3 loss to Green Bay, the team's third consecutive defeat. More
eerily, it was also the day on which 144 people were killed when a Pacific
Southwest Airlines 727 jet collided over San Diego with a Cessna 172.
Dan Fouts picks up the story: "It was such a strange day. There is this
huge disaster in the city. Then there's a team meeting. We're 1-3 at this
point and going nowhere. Just got crushed by Green Bay, and we were aw-
ful. So they fire Prothro, and he talks to us, and then he walks out of the
room. Now, our team was pathetic under Prothro, but he was this big, im-
posing Southern gentleman. And right after he walks out, in walks Don,
and he's this smaller guy with a funny voice. (To this day, anyone who has
known Coryell can imitate his urgent, nasal inflection.)
"Don stands up there," says Fouts, "and he says, 'People think I'm crazy
to take this job. I'm still getting paid by the St. Louis Cardinals. And I'm sit-
ting up on that hill, getting paid for doing nothin'. But I'm a little bit crazy.
I'm crazy enough to turn this thing around.' And we're all just looking at
each other, and I'm thinking, Holy shit, what a refreshing attitude. It was a
breath of fresh air. And from that point on, we were just ready to take off."
Coryell recalls, "Gene Klein told me, 'I hired you to throw the football.
Now throw it.' I said, 'That's a damn good idea.' "
It would be the true birth of what came to be known far and wide as Air
Coryell. For one season Coryell moved conservatively, but the Chargers won
seven of their last eight games to finish at 9-7. In the off-season, Coryell
brought in Gibbs and his old buddy Zampese. Fouts was already positioned
81

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
as the quarterback, and wide receiver Charlie Joiner had come by way of a
trade from the Cincinnati Bengals in '76. Wideout John Jefferson had been
the team's first pick in the '78 draft, and in the spring of '79 Coryell would
take 6' 5", 251-pound tight end Kellen Winslow, a transcendent athlete from
the University of Missouri.
What transpired was a splendid blend of players and system. Joiner was a
brilliant, cerebral pass receiver, perfectly suited to an offense in which receiv-
ers had to make decisions based on how they were played by defensive backs.
"I learned more from Joiner than he learned from me," says Zampese. Win-
slow was a wideout in a tight end's body. "If you put him in the conventional
tight end position, linebackers would just pound him every time," says Gibbs.
"So what we did is, we started moving him, putting him on the move and
getting him spread out so they couldn't hammer him. And then they couldn't
cover him, either." And Fouts had the unflagging courage to set, stand and
throw, and then to take the pounding that inevitably followed.
To a system already revolutionary in its spreads and routes, Coryell now
added motion and screens and more formations every day. Weekday game-
planning sessions took on a giddy aura.
"Let's say it's a Wednesday," says Fouts. "It's nine o'clock in the morning,
and they're putting up the plays that we're going to run against this week's
team. Joe Gibbs would say, 'O.K., here's the way they read motion by the tight
end, so we're going to run this play against it, and here's why it will work.' And
he would do that with the whole game plan, and we walk out of the meeting
and we've already won the game. Wednesday was a better day than Sunday.
"For me," he continues, "it came down to a feeling that I can't be wrong.
If I got through my progression, if I do what I've been told by the coaching
staff, we'll have a good play. And not only that, we've got a chance to make
a big play on every snap. It was just a total confidence in every play that was
called. You know how many times I audibled in 10 years? Maybe once or
twice. Maybe. And I would get in the huddle on the first series on Sunday,
and I'd just say, 'O.K., boys, 40 today.' Or, '50 today.'
There was, always, a quirkiness to Coryell. He had that odd voice, for
starters, and he had a piercing focus that often disarmed his colleagues—or
made them laugh. Gibbs recalls once poking his head into Coryell's office,
only to find the room in nearly total darkness, with Coryell sitting at his
desk, scribbling terminology by the glow of a tiny desk light. On one morn-
82

AIR CORYELL
ing Coryell climbed into his car for the drive to work after putting the fam-
ily's garbage cans into the trunk, planning to leave them at the bottom of
the driveway for the trash collectors. Before he put the car in gear, his mind
had turned to football, and he arrived at work with the cans
still in the
trunk, where they fermented throughout the day in the sunshine. "It was
funny," says Gibbs. "But his ability to focus was phenomenal."
Over the next four seasons the Chargers went 39-18 and twice played in
the AFC Championship Game. They led the NFL in passing offense for six
consecutive years beginning in 1978. Fouts passed for more than 4,000 yards
each year from '79 to '81, including what were at the time the two highest
totals in NFL history, long before such numbers became commonplace.
Signature plays emerged from the weekly brainstormings. Joiner caught
213 passes for 3,328 yards from '79 to '81, almost exclusively on crossing
routes in the middle of the soft zone defenses that were typical in those years.
"Charlie wasn't very fast, and neither was I," says Fouts. "But my drop-back
and his routes seemed to just time out perfectly. There were times with Char-
lie, because I played with him for so long, that if you measured his heartbeat
and my heartbeat, I'll bet you'd find they were just about the same."
A single play dominated the offense: F Post. There were dozens of varia-
tions, called endlessly, first by Gibbs and then by Zampese, who dialed up
the F Post so often that throughout the NFL in later years it became known
simply as an "Ernie route."
The most common call was 525 F Post Swing. Both outside receivers
would run 15-yard outside comeback routes, carrying the corners to the
outside. The Y receiver would run a 20, or a shallow cross, occupying the
vision of the linebackers and safeties. The F receiver—sometimes a running
back, sometimes a second tight end, depending on the formation—would
then run an option post route, finding his own open path. A running back
would run a short swing pattern. "It got to be an unbelievable play, the best
play in the whole system," says Zampese. "And they still run it."

The Dal/as Cowhoys ofthe '90s took one ofthe most simple and
basic ofpassplays and, with endlesspractice and repetition, honed
it into a quick-hitting, surefire offensive weapon. Quarterback
Troy Aikman (8) took afive-step dropfrom center. Wide receiver
Michael Irvin (88) ran a skinny—or acutely angled—post
pattern (an "8" route in the original Coryell numbering system)
while reading the cornerbacks movement and timing his cut based
on the coverage. As soon asAikmans backfoot hit the ground, he
released the throw to Irvin. It was an almost unstoppableplay.

watched Air Coryell take
off.
And,
no
surprise,
it
wasn't
long before they began plucking off Coryell's assistants—obviously in
hopes of replicating this new thing. First to leave for a top job in the NFL
was Gibbs, hired to coach the Redskins in 1981. He installed the Cor-
yell offense, then sought to take away any semblance of predictability by
adding dozens of new formations and shifts from which to run the same
plays; he also built in a power running game centered on counter plays.
Gibbs's Redskins lost their first five games in 1981 but won the Super
Bowl in '82, lost it in '83 and won twice more, in '87 and '91, a dynasty
by any measure.
"No matter what you have in football," says Gibbs, "you need some-
thing you can do really well, and run it over and over again. We had the
counter game." For much of the '80s, the Redskins operated the counter
like a fine piece of machinery, using the inside zone counter and the
outside zone counter, and then developing a third counter play which
entered the language of football, fittingly enough, as the Counter Trey.
Basically, it worked like this: The strong side of the offensive line deliv-
ered gap blocks while backside guard Russ Grimm would pull and trap
85

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
the first defender outside the tight end; at the same time backside tackle
Joe Jacoby would pull and lead first through the hole between the strong
side guard and tackle, barreling upfield, 305 pounds in full, lumbering
flight, leading John Riggins or George Rogers or Earnest Byner for big
chunks of yardage.
The Counter Trey, among the most dominant single plays in the game's
history, sprung from an unlikely source. "The whole counter started, to
tell you the truth, when we saw some film on Nebraska in the early '80s,"
says Gibbs. "Tom Osborne was doing some really innovative things with
his line up front, and we were watching it and thought, God, that's good
stuff. So we stole it. We had no pride whatsoever, and really, nobody does
in this game. We all steal things." (Told, years later, that Joe Gibbs had
mimicked his blocking schemes, the forever taciturn Osborne said, "Well,
I know Joe. I talked to him. But I never knew that. I'll be darned.")
Behind the Counter Trey Gibbs kept throwing Coryell's pass routes,
adding the "bunching" of three wide receivers on one side of the for-
mation. "We kept the numbering system, the pass tree, everything," says
Gibbs. "The main thing we did that was different was that we ran the
hang out of the ball to get [the defense] close to the line of scrimmage,
and then we majored in the deep ball." Gibbs is as appreciative of Cory-
ell's influence as anyone: "Mr. Cooke [longtime Redskins owner Jack Kent
Cooke] once said, 'There are no geniuses in football.' But in a lot ofways—
the terminology, the numbering of plays, the way you read routes and his
passing tree, Don really was a genius."
While the Redskins were dominating the NFC East with their version
of Air Coryell, the Rams were using their own version a continent away.
With Zampese assisting head coach John Robinson, they melded the Cor-
yell passing game with the USC-based running game (Chapter 10) that
Robinson had learned from John McKay and used at Tailback U. With
quarterback Jim Everett and lethal F Post runner Henry Ellard leading
the way, the '89 Rams came up one win short of the Super Bowl.
They also launched another coach to prominence. After the 1990 sea-
son, Norv Turner, who had assisted Zampese with the Rams' offense,
was contacted by Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson. In two years since
taking over America's Team, Johnson had improved from 1-15 to 7-9
but wanted more from his offense. He interviewed Turner and offered
86

AIR HEIRS
him the job as offensive coordinator—with the condition that Turner
bring the Coryell scheme with him. It is hard to imagine a coach being
more ready: Turner had been steeped in this offense.
In Dallas, Turner found an ideal set of players for the system. The
third-year starting quarterback, Troy Aikman, who had thrown 36 in-
terceptions and endured 58 sacks in two seasons, was a Coryell quar-
terback waiting to happen. "The entire passing game is predicated on
having a quarterback who will turn the ball loose," says Turner. "Get
on his fifth step, or his seventh step, and when that back foot hits the
ground, the ball is out. And he has to have great anticipation, because
you're throwing into holes. So in Dallas we inherit a guy, Troy, who is as
good as anyone who has played in the system because he's such a good
athlete. He would separate from the center quicker than anyone I've
ever been around and still get set and get the ball out of his hand and
make the throws. People teaching the offense in this league still show
the first touchdown pass in our first Super Bowl [1992 season], when
Troy throws the slant to Michael Irvin and the ball goes inches— I mean
inches—above the linebacker's fingertips. That's a throw that Troy was
willing to make, and you have to be willing to make it."
If the F Post defined the early years of the Coryell offense,
it was a
route called the Bang 8 that defined these Cowboys (the Bang 8 so named
because it was a Coryell "8" route thrown very quickly—bang—and later
generically called the "skinny post" throughout football because it was a
post pattern but not run as deeply as a traditional post, thus run at a more
severe—skinny—angle). Jay Novacek, to be sure, ran the F Post brilliantly
from the flanked tight end position, but
it was Aikman and Irvin who
turned the skinny post into an almost undefendable weapon.
One player who watched the Aikman-Irvin show with interest was
Trent Green, a quarterback with the Redskins at the time. From the Skins'
sideline he watched Aikman and Irvin complete the Bang 8 with such
proficiency that his frustration turned to admiration. "The Bang 8
is a
five-step drop," he explains, "where you let the ball go based on the lever-
age of the corner. That dictates the angle of the route by the receiver and
also whether the safety is in the middle of the field or in roll coverage
[helping the corner]. Just to watch Troy and Michael run that play, you
could tell that they had repped it so many times that they could almost
87

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
make it a blind throw and complete it. From a Redskins standpoint, it was
tough to watch because we couldn't stop it. But as a quarterback, with an
appreciation of the offense, it was almost fun." Or, as Jason Garrett, Aik-
man's backup who saw the play countless times, puts it: "896 F Flat Bang
8 on the outside—if they don't roll the coverage over there, the ball is half-
way there before the receiver turns his head. And tell me that's not your
image of the Cowboys from that era: Michael Irvin catching a Bang 8."
By the time the Cowboys dynasty had captured its third Super Bowl,
concluding the 1995 season, defensive coaches were working feverishly to
counter this offensive surge, primarily with the invention of the zone blitz
in Cincinnati by defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, who then popular-
ized
it in Pittsburgh with Dom Capers (Chapter 18). In St. Louis, Mike
Martz was committed to staying a step ahead of the defensive wizards.
"With all the zone blitzes, what happened with offenses was they wanted
to know where every defender was coming from," says Martz. "So offenses
got real conservative again. Keeping another receiver in to block, that sort
of thing. We decided to do just the opposite, and that was all about the
Coryell system. We spread 'em out and said, 'Good luck finding the guy
we're throwing it to.' We took the F Post and ran it with five different po-
sitions from every formation in the playbook. We ran it with Az Hakim,
with Isaac Bruce—and Marshall Faulk was an unbelievable post runner.
At one point I counted 137 different ways we could run the F Post."
Operating Martz's system was none other than Green, now a Ram.
Green completed 28 of 32 passes in three exhibition starts, but his fun
didn't last—he went down with torn ligaments in his left knee in the
third preseason game. The offense was handed over to an unknown
quarterback named Kurt Warner, a 28 -year-old undrafted free agent,
veteran of NFL Europe, Arena Football and, at one point, a grocery store
where he stocked shelves. The system didn't miss a beat; the Rams went
13-3 and won the Super Bowl. Warner threw 41 touchdown passes, and
a legend was born.
"I loved the system from Day One," says Warner. "I loved everything
that it was about. I loved that it was deep first, then checkdowns. The de-
sign of the offense was to continually put pressure on the back end of the
defense. It was all about getting chunks of yardage.
"The F Post was
still a big part of the offense," Warner continues.
88

AIR HEIRS
"The Bang 8 got to be a little tougher because in '99 and after that, cov-
erages were starting to change. Instead of getting single high safeties,
you would get a lot more four across, which made it harder to throw that
skinny post. So we made a living off what we call a Big 4, a deep in pat-
tern. Our inside guy would push hard on the safety and force him deep,
and then we would throw inside with the Big 4, like 18 or 20 yards deep,
and that's where my accuracy was really good, and I could separate my-
self from other quarterbacks."
IT IS October 2007, and Jason Garrett sits behind his desk in an office
on the first floor of the Dallas Cowboys' sprawling suburban complex of
Valley Ranch. The surface of the desk is half covered with play diagrams,
and a whiteboard on the wall is peppered with game planning, like some
sort of arcane graffiti. Asked to describe his offensive foundation, Garrett
leans back and says, "It's what you would have to call the Coryell offense."
More than 40 years have passed since Don Coryell grew tired of losing
two games a year at San Diego State, but the offense he founded has en-
dured like little else in football.
Garrett came to the Cowboys from Miami before the '07 season and
immediately began teaching Tony Romo in the same way that Zampese
and Turner taught Aikman. "Romo was pretty good from the start," says
Garrett. "But we absolutely had to coach him to get away from the center.
And we've had to coach receivers to get off the ball. Like Ernie always said:
'Speed, speed, speed.' None of that changes." There is still a 525 F Post in
the Cowboys playbook. An Ernie route.
Half a continent away and five months later Coryell sat at that kitchen
table in fading light after several hours spent piecing together memories,
conjuring up ghosts from decades earlier. The coaches that Coryell so
profoundly influenced are astounded that he has not been enshrined in
the Pro Football Hall of Fame. "It's mind-boggling," says Martz. "I can't
think of a coach who has had a bigger impact on what is done out there
on the field than Don Coryell."

THEWEST
COAST
OFFENSE
It really should be named the Cincinnati Offense,
but make no mistake: This is the Bill Walsh's baby
Wishbone), how they work (the Zone Blitz) or where they come from (the
Green Bay Sweep). Then there is the West Coast Offense, one of the iconic
technical names in modern football, a name that can be heard endlessly
on college and professional telecasts every weekend in the
fall, a term
that lands in the average fan's comfort zone like a tall, cold beer. Yet it fits
none of the customary naming profiles:
It describes neither the look of
the offense nor its function. And while the name appears to derive from
its place of origin, even that is off by more than 2,000 miles. The name is
a mistake that took on a life of its own.
Here is how
it happened: The Cowboys were in the middle of their
minidynasty of the early and mid-'90s, a run that included three Super
Bowl
titles in four years, when SPORTS iLLUSTRATED's veteran NFL
writer Paul Zimmerman—the esteemed Dr. Z—visited the Cowboys' head-
quarters in Irving, Texas. The Cowboys' offense was a sweet balance of

ways:
from
what they look like (the

run (Emmitt Smith and fullback Daryl Johnston) and pass (Troy Aikman
to Michael Irvin and Jay Novacek, among others); Zimmerman, always
fascinated by the technical underpinnings of successful teams, wondered
what it was like behind the curtain.
Bernie Kosar, the gangly savant who had led the University of Miami
to an unexpected national championship in 1983 and had started nearly
100 games at quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, was now in Dallas as
Aikman's backup. Zimmerman sought out Kosar to learn about the offense.
Fifteen years later, at a pre-Super Bowl dinner in a steak house in Scotts-
dale, Ariz., two days before the Giants upset the Patriots, Zimmerman told
the tale of what happened. It is a tasty slice of anecdotal football history: "I
went to Kosar because I knew he would be able to explain to me what the of-
fense was. He said, 'It's the West Coast offense. Norv Turner, Ernie Zampese,
Don Coryell, Sid Gillman.' Bernie was right, and he knew his history."
Kosar was indeed correct. The offense he was describing—Air Coryell—
was begun by Coryell at San Diego State and likely influenced by Gill-
man's San Diego Chargers teams of the 1960s. Coryell tutored Zampese,
who tutored Turner, who ran the offense with the Cowboys. This attack is
most accurately called the Coryell offense. Here again, Dr. Z's telling:
"I quoted Bernie talking about the West Coast offense, and
it got
picked up by somebody out West," he said. "I think it was a wire reporter.
But that guy mistakenly attached the term "West Coast offense" to Bill
Walsh's teams in San Francisco in the 1980s with Joe Montana. And the
name stuck. It was wrong, but it stuck."
In the often murky history of football strategy, where one man's innova-
tion spills into the next, there is no evidence that anyone but Kosar and
Zimmerman coined the name "West Coast offense," as applied in Dallas.
Its application to the '80s 49ers dynasty was inaccurate, except in the very
loose sense that both Coryell and Walsh—like almost every modern coach-
were influenced by Gillman. Coryell's and Walsh's systems were different,
their terminology was different and their basic philosophy was different.
The fact that both flourished on the West Coast, Coryell's in San Diego and
Walsh's in San Francisco, only compounded the confusion.
What came to be known everywhere as the West Coast offense—for clar-
ity's sake here, let's call it the Walsh offense—was the first passing strategy
in football to effectively attack the field from sideline to sideline rather than
92

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
from the line of scrimmage forward. The Coryell offense (the original West
Coast offense) was a downfield attack. The Walsh offense used running
backs as receivers in more extensive ways than any attack before
it and,
perhaps most significant, validated the short pass as an effective offensive
weapon when most previous systems had lived and died by the long ball.
The irony
is that Bernie Kosar and Paul Zimmerman accidentally
named the West Coast offense 23 years after Bill Walsh invented it—but
Walsh did not invent it in San Francisco or even in California or anywhere
on the West Coast at all. The West Coast offense, as it's now known to all,
was born in Cincinnati.
Cincinnati, Ohio
July 1970
THE CINCINNATI Bengals began play in the summer of 1968, an expan-
sion team whose principal owner, general manager and inaugural head
coach was the esteemed Paul Brown, who as coach of the Cleveland
Browns had won four championships in the Ail-American Football Con-
ference and three more in the NFL from '46 through '55. The Bengals won
two of their first three games in that inaugural season but finished with
a 3-11 record in the brutally competitive, premerger Western Division of
the American Football League. In the spring of '69 they used the fifth pick
of the draft to select 6' 4", 220-pound quarterback Greg Cook from the
University of Cincinnati.
Cook was a sensational athletic specimen. "Greg Cook could have been
the greatest quarterback in the history of the NFL," says Sam Wyche, who
in 1969 would back up the rookie and went on to coach in the NFL for
18 years. "You could see
it from the first day of training camp. He had
everything— size, speed, rifle arm, accuracy. He had the head to run a
system and he had the physical talent to improvise if it was necessary. He
was an incredible player."
The job of schooling Cook fell to 38-year-old offensive assistant coach
Bill Walsh, who had come to Cincinnati with Brown after a year as an as-
sistant with the Oakland Raiders. Walsh had coached nine years before
arriving in the NFL, one as a graduate student at San Jose State, two as the
head coach at Washington Union High in Fremont, Calif., and three each as
93

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
an assistant at California and Stanford. Upon joining the Raiders, Walsh's
football apprenticeship accelerated. He was put in charge of running backs
and from that perspective learned the system of head coach Al Davis, who
was just one of many who had been influenced by Sid Gillman.
Davis will be remembered as a big-play, throw-the-bomb offensive
coach, but in Building a Champion, a book Walsh wrote with Glenn Dick-
ey in 1990, Walsh gives Davis credit for much more creativity than simply
playing for the deep ball. "The pass offense [in Oakland] included an
almost unlimited variety of pass patterns as well as a system of calling
them, and utilized the backs and tight ends much more extensively than
other offenses
To develop an understanding of it took time, but once
learned, it was invaluable."
Paul Brown, meanwhile, was arguably the most innovative thinker in
the game's history. He is recognized as the first coach to use game film
as a teaching tool, and he refined classroom-style preparation into the
team-meeting model still used today. So early in his career Walsh was ex-
posed to a rich confluence of football thinkers. He came to Cincinnati as
the quarterbacks and receivers coach, ready to run an offense of his own.
And Brown gave him the latitude to tinker. And in their second season
together, 1969, he was given an athlete who could do it all.
As Walsh writes in his book:
[Greg Cook] was the finest natural talent of any quarterback I have
seen. He was a brilliant athlete—big, active, with a quick arm and
great delivery—and he had the spontaneity of Joe Montana
Those
who saw Cook would have to say that physically he was the best ever
to step on the field. He wasn't just a big Adonis who could throw the
ball 100 yards. This was a quick, graceful athlete with a lightning-fast
delivery and great instincts.
COOK BECAME the Bengals' starter as a rookie, and even though the team's
final record that year was just 4-9-1, there was a promise of much greater
success ahead. The Bengals started the '69 season with three straight wins,
including a 24-19 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, who would go
on to win the Super Bowl that year. In that game Cook was thrown to the
artificial turf in Riverfront Stadium on a blitz by Chiefs All-Pro linebacker
94

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
Bobby Bell. Cook would miss parts of four games, but the full ramifica-
tions of his injury wouldn't be known until the off-season.
Cook finished the year with an NFL-rookie-record 9.41 yards per at-
tempt and with an average of 17.5 yards per completion, a mark that has
been bettered just once in the four decades since. But he was also never
the same after Bell's hit, on a rollout that Walsh would later blame him-
self for calling. He played through the season with what was diagnosed
afterward as a torn rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder, an injury that
was regularly repaired in later years but which, in 1969, essentially ended
Cook's career. By the training camp of '70 Walsh found himself with an
offensive system designed for Greg Cook, but without Cook to run it.
Instead, the Bengals were looking for a quarterback. They had Wyche,
a two-year backup who had thrown just 89 passes and would ultimately
spend most of his career as a journeyman. They had Dave Lewis, a rookie
punter who had played quarterback in college. Brown and Walsh wanted
other options, so in the middle of training camp they acquired Virgil Carter
from the Buffalo Bills. Carter had previously spent three years in the NFL,
all with the Chicago Bears. He had started five games in 1968 (winning
four) but in '69 was benched in favor of Bobby Douglass, a rugged, 6
f 4",
225-pound quarterback who was primarily a runner. "When I was traded
to the Bengals," says Carter, "I didn't even know how to spell Cincinnati or
where it was. I had to look on a map to tell my family where I was going."
Carter could not have been more different from Greg Cook. He was
listed at 6' 1", 192 pounds but probably was at least an inch shorter than
that. "Virgil couldn't throw the ball 20 yards," says Bruce Coslet, a future
NFL head coach who was a second-year tight end on that Bengals team.
Yet Carter did have skills. In 1965 and '66, Carter had been the first in
what would be a long line of effective passers at Brigham Young. As a se-
nior he passed for 2,182 yards, an unspectacular total now but among the
nation's leaders then. All of those BYU yards, however, were accumulated
in a belly-series rollout passing game with pass-run options on the corner.
No drop-back passes, few multiple-receiver patterns.
"Greg Cook was a guy who could throw the ball down the field," says
Carter. "When it turned out that he wasn't coming back as quickly as they
had hoped, they were looking for somebody to
fill the void until he did
eventually come back. I did not have a strong arm, but I was mobile. And
95

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
I had always been able to make decisions on the run as a play developed."
The combination of a healthy Virgil Carter and an injured and uncer-
tain Greg Cook presented Walsh and Brown with a dilemma. Walsh's so-
lution was to design an offense for Carter. It is the attack that, many years
later, would be labeled the West Coast offense.
"I'm not sure what they had for Greg Cook," says Carter. "As things
moved along through training camp and into that [1970] season, Bill
Walsh started putting in more things that played to my strengths-
designed scrambles, designed waggles, quick out cuts, reading defense
as you dropped back. There was very little of the seven-step drop, pat the
ball and then fire it downfield."
Walsh would write:
Virgil was a nifty athlete, but he was not considered to have a strong
arm. We had to devise a system to
fit his abilities. The timing of our
passing game now became very important. Virgil would take three steps,
throw, five steps, throw—short, quick throws within 10 yards of the line
of scrimmage
Or we would have him sprint out, to take advantage of
his mobility, and again throw the ball short.
THE EMERGENCY system was wildly successful. The third-year Bengals,
after a 1-6 start, won their last seven games to finish at 8-6 and qualify
for the playoffs. (They were beaten by the Baltimore Colts 17-0 on the
day after Christmas; the Colts would go on to win the Super Bowl.) Carter
finished a respectable 14th in the NFL in passing, seventh in the AFC.
As Walsh wrote:
With Carter at quarterback, we won our division with a 'nickel-and-dime'
offense. It was very effective because we controlled the ball
Our spe-
cific objective was to make 25 first downs a game and control the ball with
short passing and selective running
Other people in the NFL couldn't
believe Virgil could be that effective and that we could win that way.
The offense, created out of desperation, fed perfectly into Walsh's strengths
as a cerebral football coach. "Bill's thinking was completely different from
the usual football mind-set of smash, crush, destroy," says Mike Holmgren,
96

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
who in 1986 would join Walsh in San Francisco and later take the West
Coast offense to success, and Super Bowls, in Green Bay and Seattle. "It
was a chess game. And that really was the fun part of coaching. With Bill,
it was always, 'Let's figure out how we can beat this.' "
From a technical standpoint the creation of the West Coast offense
was a watershed moment in the history of the forward pass, and one that
would influence offensive systems four decades later. "Look at the NFL
right now," said Holmgren in the late summer of 2009. "It's almost easier
to count the teams that are not using some form of this system. If a team
doesn't have a shutdown defense, like Pittsburgh or Baltimore, and if a
team isn't committed to running the football, like Miami or, again, Pitts-
burgh, they're probably using some form of this passing game. Because
there's no other way to win."
From the beginning Walsh's offense was different, in several specific ways.
1) It was the first pass offense in which timing was the critical element.
While Coryell's offense at San Diego State at the same time also relied on
precise quarterback-receiver timing, Walsh's scheme put more emphasis
on shorter, more horizontal routes. Receivers in the Walsh offense were
expected to arrive at specific locations across the field in precise segments
of time, syncing up perfectly with the quarterback's drop-back, set and
delivery. In previous offenses a receiver tended to run a pattern down the
field and the quarterback would observe him and throw if the receiver
broke open—and sometimes even if he didn't. In 1969 NFL quarterbacks
completed 52.6% of their passes; in 2008 that figure was 61.0%, a game-
altering leap in efficiency. Before Walsh, the forward pass came with sig-
nificant risk; since Walsh, it has been a much more reliable chain-moving
tool. Says Wyche, "The timing and coordination of routes had to be per-
fect, and that was very different from anything I had learned previously.
The theory of every play was a designed coordination between the quar-
terback and the receivers."
2) Walsh's passing system was the first that relied on a sequence of
potential receivers, giving the quarterback a
first, second, third and
fourth option, which he would tick off one by one on his drop -back.
"It was a progression passing game," says Coslet. "If the first guy was
open, you'd throw it to him. If the second guy was open, you'd throw
it to him. If the third guy was open, you'd throw it to him. And if they
97

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
were all covered, you always had the back coming out of the backfield.
One-two -three dump."
3) It was the first offensive system to assign and incorporate what came to
be commonly known as "hot" receivers. Walsh called them "blitz" receiv-
ers. In his book Walsh wrote, "We were always looking for ways to beat
the blitz
[Opponents] assumed that when facing a total blitz, teams
would naturally keep both backs in to protect the passer." Instead, Walsh's
teams would routinely send a running back into the void vacated by a
blitzing linebacker.
4) It was the first pass offense to conceive the attack horizontally rather
than just vertically. The difference is more subtle than the language may
imply. Certainly offenses had historically included pass routes in which
receivers ran across the field, and of course Walsh's offense included pat-
terns in which receivers ran straight down the field. But Walsh's offense
used countless routes in which receivers—sometimes multiple receivers-
would run all the way across a formation, virtually sideline to sideline,
forcing a defense to stretch itself across the field until openings inevita-
bly developed. "Bill always talked not only about vertical stretch but also
about horizontal stretch," says Holmgren. "The horizontal stretch exposed
where the voids were in the defense."
5) Walsh's offense turned conventional thinking about sustaining a drive
on its head. "At that point in time, the league was knee deep in power
running and taking long shots down the field," says former Ravens coach
Brian Billick, who briefly worked as a p.r. man with Walsh's 49ers and
later used the offense in both Minnesota and Baltimore. "Bill really intro-
duced the concept of using high-efficiency intermediate passing routes as
basically an extended running game."
Walsh wrote, "Many coaches didn't understand that style of 5-to-6-yard
completions
It was very effective because we controlled the ball."
The Walsh offense was a technical marvel, to be sure. But as time passed,
it was not only the schematic qualities of the West Coast offense that
emerged but also the very coaching style that Walsh would carry forward
through the years of the 49ers' dynasty. The enduring success of the West
Coast offense has much to do with the way Walsh taught it in the classroom
and on the field, with every aspect preached and drilled in minute detail.
"Bill really believed in the value of running after the catch, and I think
98

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
he was one of the first coaches to stress that," says Wyche. "Even back in
Cincinnati he would always preach to receivers, 'Your first move has to be
toward the goal line. Never mind trying to make that first guy miss. Screw
that. Get two yards upfield. Then try to make somebody miss.' In order to
make this happen, he was obsessive about where the ball was completed.
He always wanted passes completed above the waist so the receiver didn't
have to go to the ground."
Says Coslet, "If the ball wasn't thrown 1/2 feet in front of the receiver,
Bill would go ballistic. He was a real stickler for accuracy. And he nev-
er wanted his quarterback in the shotgun, because that meant looking
down to catch the snap, and then he wouldn't be looking at the defense
and his receivers."
In Walsh's world there was no room for good plays with sloppy execu-
tion. "I remember vividly one practice in San Francisco," says Holmgren.
"Joe [Montana] threw a ball that Jerry [Rice] had to reach back for. Just
slightly. But Jerry was so great, he just reached back, caught the ball and
turned upfield. I said something like, 'Nice job.' Well, out of the distance I
hear this voice. Miiiiiiiike. Bill would drag it out in this whiny tone. Don't
you want that ball thrown six inches in front of the numbers? And that's
the way Bill would do it, too. He would yell at the coach, and the players
would subtly get the idea and work harder so their position coach didn't
get yelled at by Bill. It was a very interesting philosophy."
In Walsh's eight years in Cincinnati, his offense flourished. In the third
round of the 1971 draft the Bengals selected Ken Anderson out of tiny Au-
gustana College in western Illinois. Anderson sat one year behind Virgil
Carter but quickly developed into an even better pilot for the Walsh offense.
He was decisive, efficient and reliable, if unspectacular. ("Anderson has re-
ceived the kind of acclaim usually reserved for a shoe salesman," wrote SI in
1975.) He also had a stronger arm than Carter and was just as accurate.
The Bengals became playoff contenders. In 1975 they went 11-3 but
lost to Oakland 31-28 in the first round of the playoffs. It would be Walsh's
last season in Cincinnati; he left embittered when Paul Brown, upon his
retirement, named Bill Johnson his successor instead of Walsh. Walsh
was gone, on to a one-year stop in San Diego and two years at Stanford.
In '79 he was hired as coach of the 49ers, where he orchestrated a near-
perfect union of players and system.
99

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
In his first draft with San Francisco in '79, Walsh selected Notre Dame
quarterback Joe Montana in the third round, famously low for a player
who would become what many feel is the best ever to play the position in
the NFL. "Physically, he was not off the charts," says Holmgren. "He had
a good arm but not a rocket arm. He was thin with skinny legs, and while
he moved pretty well, he wasn't fast. But he was so accurate. He was like a
ballerina back there, and he was always in such perfect rhythm with Bill's
style of offense."
In that same
'79
draft Walsh found Dwight
Clark, a
slow,
6' 4",
212-pound receiver from Clemson, in the 10th round. He too was a per-
fect fit for the Walsh system, a diligent route-runner with good hands who
could find horizontal holes in a defense, turn upfield and gain positive
yardage, again and again. "Dwight Clark couldn't run," says Coslet, "but
he was a great receiver."
Clark also possessed a quality that Walsh craved in his wideouts:
toughness. "Bill wanted his receivers to turn upfield and make yards, of-
ten in the middle of the field," says Billick. "They were going to get hit. Bill
wanted big guys who could take a physical pounding."
The system got better as the players got better, and there would be
more. The 49ers drafted running back Roger Craig out of Nebraska in
the second round of the 1983 draft, and Craig became the model for a
West Coast offense flare-route receiver. He would catch 566 passes in his
career, including 92 in '85. "Roger Craig was a guy who could stay on the
field," says Wyche. "Other teams in a passing down, they would have to
bring in another wide receiver. Roger Craig was already as good at catch-
ing the ball as most wide receivers." Adds Holmgren, "You always have to
adapt the system to your personnel. When I was at Seattle, we had Shaun
Alexander, and he was a great running back. But he was an average re-
ceiver and a horrible blocker. So in certain situations we had to get him
off the field. Bill could just leave Roger Craig on the field."
In 1985 came Jerry Rice from Mississippi Valley State. "He broke the
mold," says Holmgren. "A big guy [6' 2", 200] who could run and who
was tough." John Taylor, a poor man's Jerry Rice, was drafted a year later.
It was the ideal collection of players to run Walsh's system, no accident,
Walsh knew exactly what he needed.
Signature plays developed. Whereas the Coryell passing game featured
100

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
plays described principally by numbers, plays in the Walsh offense were
named with words. Example: What was termed 585 H Angle in the Cor-
yell scheme was 22 Texas in the Walsh scheme. The play any football fan
has seen most in four decades of the Walsh offense is X Shallow Cross. In
its most basic form, from a set with a tight end and two wide receivers,
the tight end runs a 10-yard cross, stretching the linebackers horizontally,
while the "X" receiver runs across the formation from the opposite side,
capitalizing on the chaos created by the tight end. The X either finds a
hole in the defense and sits down for the ball or continues across. Dwight
Clark ran
it. John Taylor ran
it. Larry Fitzgerald runs
it for the Arizona
Cardinals now. Rarely is an NFL game played—or a college game for that
matter—without somebody running X Shallow Cross.
The West Coast offense began spreading when Wyche took
it with
him to Cincinnati—back to its place of origin—as head coach in 1984 and
eventually molded pieces of the system into a no huddle offense that he
took to the Super Bowl in the '88 season. Walsh left the 49ers after beat-
ing Wyche's Bengals in that game, Super Bowl XXIII, and was replaced by
assistant George Seifert. The 49ers repeated as world champions in '89;
Holmgren stayed for two more seasons, leaving to become head coach
of the Green Bay Packers. His replacement as offensive coordinator in
San Francisco was 39-year-old Mike Shanahan, a driven football thinker
who had endured two tumultuous seasons ('88-89) as head coach of the
LA. Raiders and in '90 and '91 had been quarterbacks coach under Dan
Reeves with the Denver Broncos, tutoring John Elway.
In San Francisco, Shanahan was taking on a veteran team, where his
offensive chops would be challenged every day. And he knew it. "I was
walking onto a team that had Joe Montana, Steve Young, Jerry Rice," says
Shanahan. "You walk into that situation, you better know more about the
offense than they do. And they knew a lot."
Here
is where
Bill Walsh's brilliance visited
itself upon Shanahan.
Throughout
his
tenure
at San
Francisco, Walsh had videotaped
all
meetings—whether with the full team and coaching staff or simply with
the offense or just the quarterbacks. "Bill had a library of every meeting,"
says Shanahan. "I watched every one of those tapes.
I was watching a
coach who had won three Super Bowls in nine years, and I was watching
every meeting he conducted. It was exciting for me. It's like I was there."
101

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
After helping the 49ers win Super Bowl XXIX in 1995, Shanahan be-
came head coach of the Broncos, where he installed huge chunks of the
Walsh offense for Elway and added new wrinkles to fit Elway's consider-
able talents. "There were no seven-step drops in the West Coast system,
but John had a very strong arm and wanted some seven-step drops, so we
put them in," says Shanahan. "John was great out of the shotgun, so we
put the shotgun in."
An equally significant germination was taking place in Green Bay, where
Holmgren had taken over the Packers; shortly after his hiring, the club
traded for an unknown second-year quarterback name Brett Favre. Favre
had a powerful arm that would become mythic. "I go from the ballerina
[Montana] to this wild stallion," says Holmgren. "It was like Bill going from
Greg Cook to Virgil Carter in Cincinnati, except in the other direction."
Holmgren stayed true to basics of Walsh's offense but opened up the
formation. Where Walsh usually had two wide receivers, Holmgren be-
gan using three. His coaching staff included Jon Gruden, who would
become a head coach in 1998 at age 34, and Andy Reid, who would take
over the Eagles a year later at age 40. Both took the Walsh offense with
them and added their own touches—Gruden using many more sets and
men in motion, Reid adding a zone-blocked power running game. Both
went to Super Bowls.
As Walsh acolytes permeated the league and more teams incorporated
the controlled, short passing game, defenses predictably sought answers.
The best response came in the form of the Cover Two descendant built by
Monte Kiffin and Tony Dungy with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the '90s
and called Tampa Two (Chapter 16). The central philosophy of the Tampa
Two was to allow the short passing gains but tackle well, forcing teams to
sustain long, slow scoring drives.
"In this offense," says Holmgren, "huge chunks of yardage will happen.
But more often you were scoring on an eight- or 10-play scoring drive.
Carving up the defense a few yards at a time. The times when we really
struggled were against the teams that played that Cover Two scheme re-
ally well. They would get in that two-deep look, tackle well and really
make you earn the yards, make you execute all the way up the field.
"And all of us calling the plays would eventually get impatient," says
Holmgren. "You're making first downs and moving up the field, but it's
102

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
like watching paint dry. You get emotional and you think, 'Enough of this
b.s. Let's try something down the field. And, of course, that's playing right
into the defense's hands."
ON JAN. 10, 1982, Virgil Carter watched on television as the San Fran-
cisco 49ers played the Dallas Cowboys for the NFC championship and
a place in Super Bowl XVT. Carter, 36 years old and five seasons out of
football, had secured his place as the first quarterback ever to play in the
West Coast offense, although that distinction would seldom be recognized
outside the game's inner circles. However, on this late evening he would
understand better than most as he watched one of the most memorable
plays in the history of the NFL.
The play was called Brown Left Slot—Sprint Right Option. It is known
now to all good football fans as simply The Catch, Montana's six-yard,
game-winning completion to Clark in the end zone with 51 seconds to
play. The play lives eternally, run again and again by way of NFL Films:
There is Montana rolling right, drifting and drifting farther until he is
nearly at the sideline, twice cocking his arm and resetting before throw-
ing high and deep to the back of the end zone. Clark has run a cross to
the inside and adjusts to Montana's roll and jumps high to catch the ball
behind Dallas cornerback Everson Walls.
Montana's first read was slot receiver Freddie Solomon, who was cov-
ered. He threw instead to the back line as he floated dangerously close to
the sideline, and it is still on occasion speculated that he was throwing the
ball away and got lucky when Clark leaped to the rescue.
Virgil Carter knew better. "That first year in Cincinnati, 1970, Bill Walsh
put in a play called Scramble Right," says Carter. "We would work on it in
practice every day. I would move right, and the outside guy would clear,
just like Freddie Solomon did, and the deep receiver would run across the
back of the pattern, just like Dwight Clark did. By '82, they might not have
been calling it Scramble Right anymore, but Joe Montana knew that Clark
was back there. I knew it, too, as soon as he threw the ball."

Here was one man's proof that a key to football will always be
knocking the crap out ofsomebody else at the line ofscrimmage
Miami, Fla.
\
HE NEW Orleans
Saints
Oct. 25, 2009
arrived
in South
Florida
on this afternoon unbeat-
en in five games to begin
the 2009 season. They had scarcely been tested and possessed the league's
most lethal passing game. Head coach-play-caller Sean Payton's hybrid
offense (a mix of systems, including the West Coast and Coryell) had been
made surgical in the hands of veteran quarterback Drew Brees. The Saints
had scored six passing touchdowns in the season opener against Detroit
and hadn't let up. Next would be the Miami Dolphins, who had bounced
back from an 0-3 start to win two consecutive games.
What happened in the
first two quarters of this game veered sig-
nificantly from the anticipated script. The Dolphins' 3-4 defense, with
natural edge pass rushers Jason Taylor and Joey Porter lined up as the
outside linebackers, sold out on the run to focus instead on effectively
pressuring Brees. Late in the first half the Saints trailed 24-3 before
scoring late to narrow the gap to 24-10. In those first 30 minutes the
Saints ran 30 offensive plays, the Dolphins 32; the Saints threw 22 pass-
es and ran eight times; the Dolphins threw 10 passes and ran 22 times.
In the second half, though, the roles were reversed. The Dolphins vir-
tually abandoned the ground game—inexplicably so—with inexperienced
105

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
quarterback Chad Henne throwing 26 passes; Miami ran the ball just sev-
en times. The Saints, meanwhile, also changed their strategy entirely and
employed a more balanced split of 19 runs and 16 passes, enabling them
to seize control of the line of scrimmage, slow the Dolphins' pass rush and
stage a furious rally to win the game, 46-34. The Saints pounded Miami
for 115 yards on the ground in the second half, transforming themselves
at halftime from stunt plane into bulldozer.
After the game the Saints' offensive linemen sat in their dressing cu-
bicles in the belly of Land Shark Stadium stripping tape from knees
and ankles. As with most of their peers on the O-line, they look to be an
unathletic lot, with their thick legs and jiggling bellies (for power, and
for protection). Yet they remain, as always, the foundation on which
every offensive play is built. Jon Stinchcomb, the hulking right tackle,
stiffened and fell backward onto a chair in the middle of an interview.
"Little cramp there," he said, pointing to his left foot, which was twitch-
ing like a hooked trout on a dry dock.
The game had turned into their kind of contest. In the second half the
offensive line had been freed from the passive restraint of pass-blocking,
backpedaling to try to control an onrushing defender; instead the line
was allowed to attack the defense to create holes for the running game.
Ask any offensive lineman at any level if he would rather run-block or
pass-block and you'll get the same answer. "Being able to run the ball
sets up everything in this league," said Saints left tackle Jermon Bush-
rod, enjoying the victory. "When you push out and run the ball, teams
just can't load up and rush the passer the way they were doing in the
first half. And every offensive lineman would rather hit somebody than
sit back and get hit. That's human nature."
Said Stinchcomb, "Anytime you're able to have some offensive bal-
ance and keep a defense respecting both aspects of your game, you're
going to have more success. We see that time and time again. Today, we
had to get the game back to a manageable point differential, then we
could mix the run in with the pass."
This is hardly a new concept;
it is fundamental football. Yet for the
Saints of '09, dedication to the run was a recent addition to their rep-
ertoire. The Payton-Brees passing game, in which the Saints elevated a
group of relatively unheralded wide receivers to a potent unit, had made
106

LOMBARDI'S POWER SWEEP
the Saints competitive. The running game, with backs Mike Bell, Reg-
gie Bush and Pierre Thomas and a stout offensive line executing a zone-
blocking scheme, made them whole.
These Saints represented a something of a reversal of the obvious
and essential order of football. Historically, the run came first, followed
by the pass. The sport is built on the idea of physical domination, with
the running game at its core. Yet as modern football moved into the
mid-1950s, the pass and run were in a subtle tug- of-war for ownership
of the game. Passing was
still simplistic, but seductive. The running
game had grown stale.
Coaches anticipated the birth of something new and innovative to
carry the running game into the latter half of the 20th century. What
they got, instead, was a very old school coach, Vince Lombardi, build-
ing the power sweep from the same principles that had once made the
single wing effective. First he used his power sweep in New York as an
assistant with the Giants and then, more famously, in Green Bay after
arriving there in 1959.
In short, the new phase in the evolution of the ground game wasn't
new, it was old. It wasn't complex, it was simple. It was football at its most
basic: survival of the strongest and the toughest.
THEY SAT inside a picnic shelter on a summer afternoon signing auto-
graphs. Max McGee, then 69, affixed his signature to a stack of artist's
prints depicting his epic—and unlikely—two-touchdown performance
in the first Super Bowl. "I sort ofremember that day," says McGee, who
notoriously stayed out all night on the eve of the game, delivering a
well-practiced line with convincing fogginess. Paul Hornung, 66, sits
next to McGee, signing a classic picture from I960, in which he is run-
ning onto the field, bright sunshine illuminating his blond curls, eye
black edging his cheekbones, a green-and-yellow Green Bay Packers
helmet dangling from his right hand.
Hornung, the erstwhile Golden Boy, is not so Golden anymore, and
certainly not a boy. His head is still full of hair, but it is silvery now.
McGee is bald, much as he was as a player, and he reminds the crowd
with vaudevillian style, dipping his mug toward Hornung, "He's the
one with the gray hair. I don't have any gray hair," says McGee. It is a
107

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
small crowd in a small town, and an adoring one. Chuck Roeske, 62, a
maintenance machinist at the local Veterans Administration hospital,
regards them with awe. "These guys were the greatest," he says. "Real
football players."
The Green Bay Packers of Vince Lombardi left a lasting imprint
on football in America, images handed down through four decades of
fans. Most often it is the image of the man in the glasses with the gaps
in his teeth, fedora atop his head, pacing the sideline. And no part of
Packers lore has a more vibrant afterlife than Lombardi's prized cre-
ation, the power sweep, the chalkboard emblem of the first dynasty of
the modern NFL.
It was this single play that would represent the cool efficiency that
made Lombardi's Packers great, and
it was these charismatic Pack-
ers that gave the NFL a foundation on which to build its future, of-
fering a '50s simplicity and sociability as comfortable as a suburban
backyard cookout. For opposing defenders, though, the power sweep
wasn't comfortable at all—that apparent simplicity was instead almost
maddening. Yet the sweep had
its own sweet complexity, perfected
only through endless repetition. "It wasn't a simple play," says Ron
Kramer, the 6' 3", 234-pound tight end from Michigan who played on
Lombardi's first six teams. "But when you run it 25 or 30 or 50 times a
day, it starts to become very simple, and that's exactly what we did."
The sweep was most often run by Hornung, the dashing, dynamic
1956 Heisman Trophy winner from Notre Dame. For so many football
fans
it is an indelible picture: Hornung, the ball in the crook of his
arm, dancing to the outside; guards Fuzzy Thurston and Jerry Kramer,
each barely bigger than a modern wide receiver, barreling out in front;
fullback Jim Taylor and right tackle Forrest Gregg in their trench labor
being swallowed along the path. It is arguably the most lasting image
in NFL history.

fab 1959
LOMBARDI'S PACKERS gathered for the first time in the summer of
1959, the vestiges of a franchise that had won just a single game in the
108

LOMBARDl'S POWER SWEEP
1958 season and hadn't had a winning season since going 6-5-1 under
Curly Lambeau in 1947. Lombardi was the head coach, but he had run
the New York Giants' offense under Jim Lee Howell and he would run
the Packers' offense as well. He introduced the sweep to his team on
the very first day of practice. "He told us, 'This will be the key to the
whole running game,' " recalls Hornung. "He told us it was something
we had to do perfectly."
It was no surprise to the Packers' veterans. They had seen the Giants
run the sweep with Frank Gifford carrying the ball. "Lombardi showed us
films of the Giants every day," says Hornung. "We watched Frank Gifford
run that play over and over again. He brought his whole offense with him
from New York to Green Bay, but the sweep was the thing he really made
us work on. And we knew it was coming."
In truth, the sweep went back much further than the Giants, back to
the roots of modern power football, the single wing. Lombardi played
college football at Fordham from 1933 through
'36. He was a
5' 8",
185-pound guard on the Rams' offensive line that was nicknamed the
Seven Blocks of Granite. During that same era, Jock Sutherland over-
saw a dynasty of sorts at Pittsburgh from 1924 through '38. Running
the single wing, Sutherland took Pitt to four Rose Bowls and won pieces
of several national titles.
The single wing revolutionized football with intricate backfield fak-
ing and ballhandling but also featured punishing offensive line play
that included athletic pulling and trapping, as well as fierce double
teams at the point of attack. Single wing backs were also called upon
to read blocks and cut back accordingly. Lombardi was enamored of all
these elements, even as a college opponent. "I was impressed playing
against the Single-Wing sweep the way those Pittsburgh teams of Jock
Sutherland ran
it," Lombardi wrote, together with WC. Heinz, in his
book Run to Daylight! "And I was impressed again in those early days
of attending coaching clinics when the Single-Wing was discussed. To-
day our sweep has a lot of those Sutherland qualities, the same guard-
pulling techniques, the same ball-carrier cutback feature, and there's
nothing spectacular about it. It's just a yard-gainer."
If Lombardi's interest in the sweep began at Fordham, it was solidi-
fied at West Point, where Lombardi worked from 1949 through 1953
109

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi, David Maraniss
writes, "Since his days at West Point, [Lombardi] had based his coach-
ing philosophy on Red Blaik's belief that perfection came with sim-
plicity. The theory was to discard the immaterial and refine those few
things that one did best." He put the sweep in with the Giants in 1955,
Gifford's fourth year with the team.
In
Lombardi's own
writings he makes
it
clear
that
the power
sweep—49 Sweep in the Packers' playbook—would be his core play
and that its proper execution would achieve not only yardage but larger
goals. "It is our number one play, our lead play, that 49 Sweep," he wrote
in Run to Daylight!
It is our bread-and-butter, top-priority play, the one we have to make
go and the one our opponents know they must stop. All teams have
them. Detroit has that fullback slant for Nick Pietrosante, the Bears
have that pitchout for Willie Galimore, the Browns use that fullback
wedge with Jimmy Brown. Continued success with it, of course, makes
a number one play because from that success stems your confidence.
And behind all that is the basic truth that it expresses you as a coach
and the players as a team and that they know full well when they ex-
ecute it and it's completely right.
"THAT FIRST training camp in '59," recalls Ron Kramer, the tight end,
"we had a seven-man blocking sled on the practice fields. Every day we
would go out at the start of practice, and we'd get on the seven-man
sled. Bart Starr or one of the other quarterbacks would stand off to
the side, calling out a cadence: Set. Four-22. Hut! Hut! And we would
crack into that sled. Lombardi would be standing on the sled, and he'd
yell, 'O.K., one more time!' And we would do it again until finally Lom-
bardi was smiling and he'd say, 'That's the way I want it done!'!"
Inside the repetition was a precise division of labor. "In football,
no one can take all the credit for making a play successful; that's the
beauty of the game," says Kramer. "It has to be everybody together."
Over time the Packers' sweep has come to be most closely identified
with the two pulling guards, Thurston and Jerry Kramer. "But every-
body had a key block," says Ron Kramer. "Everybody had to do a job."
110

LOMBARDl'S POWER SWEEP
body had a key block," says Ron Kramer. "Everybody had to do a job."
(Devotees of vintage reels from NFL Films may recall a classic piece
on Lombardi in which he is standing at a chalkboard, apparently out-
doors on a practice field, diagramming the power sweep: What we're
trying to get is a seal here and a seal here and run this play in
.
.
. the
.
.
.
alley. In this instance the importance of the precision of each assign-
ment is clear, and the scene has routine stamped all over it.)
In his book he writes, "I've diagrammed it so many times and coached
it so much and watched it evolve so often since I first put it in with the
Giants eight years ago that I think I see it in my sleep."
The sweep was run from a splitback formation, with a flanker (it was
usually Boyd Dowler) to the strong side, outside the tight end. (Ron
Kramer, whose legacy would become entwined with this play, was re-
turning from a year of military service and first had to beat out Gary
Knafelc to get the starter's job.) The line was balanced, a tackle and a
guard on each side of the center. Starr was under center, and the backs
were split behind him. In the early years those backs were most often
Hornung and Jim Taylor, with Hornung on the left and Taylor on the
right, each lined up on the outside leg of the guard in front of him. The
sweep was most often run to the right, largely because Hornung ran it
better—and Taylor, a tough-as-nails inside hammer, excelled at every-
thing else, particularly running between the tackles.
"And there was another reason for running right," says Hornung. "If
you ran it to the left, you'd have Max McGee out there blocking for me on
some linebacker and, crissakes, nobody wanted that."
While the mythology of the sweep exalts the pulling guards, in
truth the three most challenging blocks were delivered by tight end
Ron Kramer, fullback Taylor and center Jim Ringo. Most important
of those was Kramer, who at the snap was responsible for blocking
the player across from him, usually the outside linebacker. "Never
allow penetration to the inside or over you hard," wrote Lombardi in
describing the tight end's role. "If he penetrates inside, he knocks off
both our pulling guards." In other words, the play would be blown
up. To the inside of Ron Kramer, right tackle Gregg and Taylor were
responsible for working as a pair—in a style that, looking back,
is
suspiciously similar to the "zone blocking schemes" that were yet to
111

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
prevent the defensive end from disrupting beyond the line of scrim-
mage. If any of these three players failed, the sweep could not work,
and Jerry Kramer and Thurston, the pulling guards, would not ramble
into space ahead of Hornung.
Jim Hanifan was coaching high school football in California in 1959,
watching the Green Bay sweep from afar; he would later become one
of the most successful offensive line coaches in league history. "I tried
to coach that damn sweep in college ball," says Hanifan. "It was really,
really hard to do. You were asking for two key blocks from the tight
end and from the lead back and tackle. And both of those blocks had
to be successful, and that was not easy to get done. Green Bay in those
early years with Lombardi had a great, great tight end in Ron Kramer,
and he would just kick your ass. And then Gregg and Taylor usually
did a good job, and then you get the guards out there and make some
money for yourself."
On a Friday fall afternoon in 2009 Ron Kramer was driving from
Chicago to Green Bay with his old pal Hornung and became just a little
bit emotional when recalling Lombardi's appreciation for his work on
the edge of the sweep. Said Kramer, "The nicest compliment that Vince
Lombardi ever gave me—and it gives me chills to think about it—was
that having Kramer at tight end was like having 12 men on the field
because he didn't have to worry about double-teaming anybody. That
meant so much to me when he said that."
Ringo's block at center was also difficult. He had to execute what
is called a "reach block" (extending laterally to block a defender who
is in a seemingly advantageous position), in this case on the play-side
defensive tackle to prevent him from achieving any penetration. Once
all of these blocks were delivered—and it all happened in less than two
seconds—guards Kramer (from the right) and Thurston (from the left)
were free to barrel down the line of scrimmage, turn upfield and pick
off defenders in the open field. And they were brilliant at doing it, as
was Hornung at reading their blocks.
The exchange from Starr to Hornung was a straight handoff. Starr
would reverse pivot—turning to his left—while Hornung began running.
Starr would stick the ball into Hornung's belly with his left hand. "I'd
run two steps to the right and then as soon as I got the ball, I'd deepen
112

LOMBARDI'S POWER SWEEP
run two steps to the right and then as soon as I got the ball, I'd deepen
by a yard and a half," says Hornung. "That would give me and the guards
both a chance to make a cut off Ron's block. We all had to watch what
Ron was doing with the linebacker. If he took the linebacker inside, me
and Jerry and Fuzzy would run outside. If he took him outside, we'd run
up inside. I think everything moved quicker to the inside. But the whole
key was watching Ron and that linebacker."
The play was made even more effective by the possibility that Hor-
nung might throw the ball, an "option pass" in the language of the
day. He had been a quarterback at Notre Dame, and though he was
primarily a runner and threw only 55 passes in his entire nine-season
NFL career, the threat of the option pass helped keep cornerbacks
honest and enabled flanker Dowler to deliver a better block on the
deepest defender.
The sweep was the backbone of Lombardi's attack, operated by
the perfect combination of athletes. Ron Kramer was a horse, bigger
and stronger than most outside linebackers at the time. Gregg was
a powerful man-on-man blocker. Thurston and Jerry Kramer were
not giants (247 and 245 pounds, respectively), but they were terrific
athletes, capable of engaging defensive backs in the open field. "It
wasn't a game-breaking play," says Ron Kramer. "It was a solid five,
six, seven-yard play every time. It was made to keep the ball and wear
out the defense."
Says Hornung: "Lombardi loved to show us the sweep on film after
the game. Boy, he got his jollies when we did it right. More that any-
thing else, I think."
Bill Yeoman, who in the 1960s invented the triple option Houston
veer, recalls attending a Lombardi clinic in the late 1950s. "Vince would
get so excited talking about the sweep," says Yeoman, "I thought he was
going to have an orgasm right there at the chalkboard."
Lombardi's beloved sweep set up two other plays: Right 47 (off-
tackle, with a lead blocker) and Right 43 (a quick-hitter straight up
the middle with the lead back), each requiring less finesse than the
sweep. Taylor was a battering ram on both, and he ran for more than
1,000 yards in each of five consecutive seasons from I960 through '64.
Together the sweep and the inside power plays formed a devastating
113

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
On this foundation Lombardi quickly righted the Packers. After a
five-game losing streak in the middle of the 1959 season, Lombardi's
first in Green Bay, the Packers closed with four straight wins to fin-
ish at 7-5. They went 8-4 and lost to the Eagles 17-13 in the '60 NFL
Championship Game but returned the next year to win 11 games in the
regular season and crush the Giants 37-0 for the team's first champi-
onship since '44. And the power sweep was the signature play of the
new champions. In his book Lombardi referred to
it as the "pay-off-
the-mortgage" play.
But as early as that first championship season, Lombardi saw other
teams begin to adapt, as he wrote in Run to Daylight!
In 1961
it started falling off a little as play recognition by the de-
fense began to develop. But in that 1961 championship game against
the Giants, Hornung made one 19-yard gain with it. Then the Giants
adjusted and when they drove Jim Katcavage, their left end, upfield
hard, we used the counter [with Taylor]. We ran inside instead of
outside, using cross-blocking, because a play's value is not only in
that play itself, but in the counter it sets up.
The Green Bay power sweep would ultimately fall victim not only
to film and familiarity but also to the quickening of the modern game.
"It was a slow-developing play, where Hornung would run outside
to the numbers, where, we used to say, the grass is still green," says
Howard Mudd, an offensive lineman with the San Francisco 49ers of
the 1960s and later a respected NFL line coach. "It was a play that
went sideways and up."
Defenses became faster. Inside-out pursuit became a more com-
mon factor in defending outside players. If a halfback like Hornung
waited
for blockers, he would be caught by backside and inside
chasers. As speed became paramount and precision less valuable, a
new sweep— a quicker, more dynamic sweep—would take root, half
a continent away.
But the Green Bay power sweep left a deep imprint on the soul of
the sport and on the men who ran it. Hornung, riding shotgun on the
drive with Kramer back up to Green Bay, told tall tales on his old bud-

drive with Kramer back up to Green Bay, told tall tales on his old bud-
dy and then made sure that a passenger understood that he might be
stretching the truth. But not about everything. As the flat, Midwestern
landscape raced past the car windows, Hornung declared, "They never
did stop our sweep."

At Southern Cal in the '70s and '80s, the Trojans incorporated
many oftheprinciples ofthe Lombardi sweep but used their speed
to hit the defense more quickly. Both guardspulled, but unlike in
the Lombardi sweep, only theplay-side guardattempted to get out
infront ofthe ballcarrier andmove downfield. (Sometimes the
Trojanspulled the backside tackle as well) The USC sweep was
runfrom an Iformation in which the quarterback wouldpitch
the ball to the tailback (unlike the Packers handoff), enabling the
runner to get outside more quickly.

have come a long way.
Once upon a time they
were gyms with
offices
tucked into dark corners, or field houses with offices stuck somewhere
behind the bleachers, and you had to work hard just to find the coach.
Gradually they have become, of course, something much more, giant pal-
aces erected in homage to the money of some alumnus. They have elabo-
rate workout rooms and shiny office suites overlooking the field.
USC's Heritage Hall is something altogether different. It is not a pal-
ace, because it is not new or vast or opulent. But it is a shrine, and that
is apparent from the seven Heisman Trophies on display, under glass, in
the first-floor lobby. In Heritage Hall—even the name is instructive—it
is impossible to forget who has trod the floor beneath your feet.
On this day, USC coach John Robinson, who will turn 60 at the end of
the following month, is sitting in a meeting room on the second floor of
the building. Robinson is beginning the third year of his second tour as
coach of the Trojans. (The first was from 1976 through '82; this second
run would last from '93 through '97.) He is sitting in darkness, his profile
illuminated by an overhead projector that spins out past Trojan glory,
much of it orchestrated by Robinson.
117

The viewing isn't Robinson's idea. "I don't spend a lot of time remi-
niscing," he says. But once the show begins, he assumes a coach's pose:
loafers on the table, remote control resting in the palm of his right hand
with his thumb at the ready.
On the screen there is an image of the late Ricky Bell, who played for
USC from 1973 through '76 and was the starting tailback on Robinson's
first team as head coach. The narrator on the film intones, "One of the
highlights ofRobinson'sfirstyear in '76 was the play ofsenior tailback Ricky
Belir He gained 1,433 yards that year and scored 14 touchdowns as the
Trojans went 11-1.
"Great player, collision runner like Earl Campbell," says Robinson. His
voice cracks slightly. Bell died of sudden heart failure in 1984; he was
only 29 years old. "This guy was a great kid," says Robinson. "A big-time
human being."
Now the screen is lit with action of the 1980 Rose Bowl, in which No. 3
USC beat No. 1 Ohio State 17-16. Narrator: "USC trailed undefeated Ohio
State in thefinal minutes and then began one of the most devastating victory
drives in the history of the Rose Bowl
39
"I told Paul Hackett, our offensive coordinator, 'Give the ball to Charlie
White and run behind Anthony Munoz,' " says Robinson. "Munoz was a
senior, played the first three plays of the first game of the season and got
hurt. He came to me in December and said, 'Should I play in the Rose
Bowl or redshirt?' I told him he really should play, and if he plays well,
he'll get drafted anyway. Hell, he was the third guy picked in the whole
draft. Charlie White broke his nose in that game, blood all over his face.
Toughest player I've ever been around. His fullback was Marcus Allen.
One hundred eighty-five pounds."
The show goes on for nearly an hour. Highlight films like this have a
way of making the ordinary seem extraordinary. But the USC production
that Robinson is watching is a true cavalcade of greatness. Sam Cunning-
ham, Charlie Young, Lynn Swann, Anthony Davis, Pat Haden, Bell, Mar-
vin Powell, Clay Matthews, Paul McDonald, Munoz, White, Allen, Ronnie
Lott, Dennis Smith—it's like a football fantasy camp. Robinson coached
all of them, either as an assistant (1972-74) or head coach, before moving
to the NFL for nine years as coach of the Rams.
The flow of talent running through USC during the Robinson years
118

STUDENT BODY RIGHT
was unprecedented in the college game. "Big man on big man" is what
renowned former USC assistant Marv Goux would call the Trojans' prac-
tices. "We has so much talent and we played so hard during the week,"
recalls former tight end Charlie Young, "our practices were harder than
the games." Through all those years there was a relentless, punishing of-
fensive system built on foundation plays that became known throughout
the college game as student body right and student body left. They were
power sweeps run with mammoth linemen leading fast, tough tailbacks
out of the
I formation; they were descendants of the Green Bay pow-
er sweep but operated by a generation of better athletes, most of whom
would also wind up in the NFL.
The modern running game began with Lombardi, who was the first to
take the ancient principles of the single wing and modernize them. But
coach after coach after coach will tell you that the next link in the chain
of innovation was the USC power game, which would later become the
Los Angeles Rams' power game. And it started well before John Robinson
got to Southern California.

BOBBY BOWDEN was 26 years old when he signed on as coach of football,
basketball and baseball at South Georgia College. Hedging against the
possibility that he might not be busy enough, Bowden was also the athlet-
ic director. But his future lay in football, and he knew it. And he also knew
he needed an offense. The closest major university was 126 miles south-
west in Tallahassee, where Tom Nugent was about to begin his fourth
year as coach at Florida State. Bowden and his assistant coach, Vince
Gibson (who would later be the head coach at Kansas State, Louisville
and Tulane), piled into a car and went to see Nugent—because Nugent, a
known football innovator, had something they wanted to see.
When Nugent had taken over as coach at Virginia Military Institute in
1949, the predominant offensive attack in college football (and, indeed,
in professional football as well) was the T formation. Nugent was looking
for something different to run. He designed a formation in which all three
backs lined up directly behind the quarterback, in a single line, perpen-
119

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
dicular to the line of scrimmage. Just as the T formation was named for
its appearance, so was this: the I.
Nugent did not run the
I in his inaugural season; that would begin
in 1950. In his history of VMI
athletics, The Corps Roots the Loudest,
Thomas W. Davis writes:
Nugent's second season was one of the most unusual in VMFs gridiron
history. It started with a high note of success, a 25-19 night game win
over William and Mary in Roanoke, the first loss by [William and Mary]
to a Virginia team in 10 years; a contributing factor was Nugent's unveil-
ing of the I formation, its first use in college football.
Later, Davis writes, "Tom Nugent's third season resulted in a 7-3
record and a Southern Conference championship that VMI shared that
year with the University of Maryland. Using their coach's
I formation
with great success, VMI's offense averaged 28 points in each of the sev-
en wins." Nugent stayed one more season before taking his offense to
Florida State.
BOWDEN, BEFORE his arrival at South Georgia, had been an assistant at
Howard College (now Samford) in Birmingham, his hometown. "We ran
the dead, straight T formation at Howard," says Bowden. "We didn't split
anybody out. But I wanted to see what Tom Nugent was running at Florida
State. Well, he was running the pure I formation, with all four backs, in-
cluding the quarterback, in a straight line. Tom gave us the playbook. I still
remember it today. The off-tackle play was called the Blast. The outside play
was called the Roll. And they had a play action pass off both of them."
The I formation was a power offense with slightly more deception than
the T. With the I, offenses could run a power play off tackle by sending the
lead back one way for a fake and still have a back as lead blocker at the
point of attack. "Back in those days," says Bowden in his familiar drawl,
"there wasn't a whole lot of imagination."
Bowden ran the I formation for three years at South Georgia, and when
he went back to Howard/Samford as the head coach in 1959, he switched
to the wing T. But by the time he landed in West Virginia in '66, he was
running a pro-set I formation, with two backs behind the quarterback. It
would remain the foundation of the Bowden offense for more than three
120

STUDENT BODY RIGHT
decades and was called the multiple I. And to this day Bowden says, "You
never can tell who invented anything, but it wouldn't surprise me if Tom
Nugent invented that thing."
AT THE same time Bowden was visiting Nugent, a continent away Don
Coryell, athletic director and football coach at Fort Ord, a U.S. Army base
near the Monterey Peninsula, was tweaking the two-man I formation for
the 1956 season that he had used with success at Wenatchee Valley Col-
lege the year before.
After his one season at Fort Ord, Coryell ran the I formation for three
years at Whittier College, then went to USC as an assistant coach under
John McKay in I960. USC history generally credits McKay with installing
the power offense that would eventually become student body right, and
clearly he deserves much of the credit. Says Robinson, "There's no doubt
McKay was the guy who developed the USC offense in that era. But he
talked to a lot of people about it. I always heard there was a high school
coach somewhere in L.A. who was running the I formation offense. And
Don Coryell was somebody that McKay talked to a lot."
Once committed, McKay went all in on the power I. Willie Brown be-
came the first in a long line of brilliant, durable USC tailbacks. In McKay's
third year Brown rushed for 574 yards on just 88 carries, and USC went
10-0 in the regular season, beat Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl and won its
first national championship since 1939. The Trojans would win four more
in the next 16 years.
Robinson explains the USC power philosophy in all its breathtaking
simplicity. "Number 1," he says, "you were going to have a tailback that
you really featured. McKay wanted to develop one player who really dom-
inated the scene. You were going to give him the ball 30 times a game.
Hell, I gave it to Ricky 53 times in one game. People wanted to kill me."
(Actually Bell carried only 51 times, for 347 yards in a 23-14 win over
Washington State in 1976.)
"Then," Robinson continues, "McKay worked really hard on getting
the best offensive linemen, and really physical offensive linemen. The
goal was to physically dominate the defense, control the line of scrim-
mage and feature the tailback. Beyond that, we wanted a smart quar-
terback who could manage the game and throw individual routes when
121

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
defenses singled the wide receivers. That was Pat Haden, Paul McDonald."
The USC power offense was clearly informed by Lombardi's power
sweep. The Trojan and Packer offenses were similar in that both aspired to
get two solid blocks (in most cases the tight end and play-side tackle) on the
front side of an outside play and attack the edge of the defense. But McKay
and USC refined the play in two important ways. First, where Lombardi's
sweep began with a handoff from the quarterback to a halfback running
across the back of the formation from behind the backside guard-tackle
gap, student body right began with a quick toss from the quarterback to the
tailback, who lined up directly behind the quarterback.
"It hit faster than the Green Bay sweep," says Robinson. "By the quar-
terback flipping the ball to the tailback, who was already running to the
outside, we got the tailback outside much faster than Lombardi did. But it
was similar to the Green Bay sweep in concept, in that it broke sideways,
turned upfield and tried to ram the ball down your throat."
Second, while the USC sweep, like the Green Bay sweep, pulled both
guards (and sometimes the backside tackle), the blocking scheme was al-
tered. Says Robinson, "The backside pullers didn't attempt to get in front
of the tailback. Only the onside guard got in front." In truth, the USC
sweep was too fast-hitting for both guards to get out ahead of the tailback.
The backside guard instead picked off backside chasers.
And while the toss sweep was to become the most famous of USC's
power running plays, it was but one of four base calls. The others were
isolation (or, in coachspeak, iso\ power strong and power weak. On the
isolation call, the tailback ran straight over the middle of the offensive
line, with a double-team block on the nose and the fullback leading. Pow-
er strong was an off-tackle play to the tight end side, and power weak
had a fullback leading the play away from the tight end side. "It was an
offense that you could draw up real simply," says Munoz. "But it required
real tough, effective man-to-man blocking by the tackle and the tight end
on the play side."
In 1965 Mike Garrett won the Heisman Trophy running behind sopho-
more offensive tackle Ron Yary, who two years later would win the Out-
land Trophy and eventually become an All-Pro with the Vikings. Five
years later, in '70, McKay took the Trojans to Alabama to play Bear Bry-
ant's Crimson Tide at Legion Field in Alabama. Rare is the game that be-
122

STUDENT BODY RIGHT
comes an implement of social change, but not long after USC sophomore
Sam Cunningham trampled Alabama for 135 yards, Bryant began to plead
with his university to integrate the program.
Eight years later, under Robinson, the Trojans went to Birmingham
again, this time with an offensive line that included Munoz and Keith Van
Home as the tackles, Brad Budde at one of the guard positions and Hoby
Brenner at tight end. Charles White was the tailback, and blocking for
him was an undersized freshman stud, who Robinson just had to get on
the field somewhere—Marcus Allen. It was one of the most talent-stuffed
college football teams in the game's long history. The Trojans beat the
Tide 24-14, and nothing better illustrated USC's power game than Van
Home's dominance of Alabama defensive tackle Marty Lyons. "All we
heard all week was what a tough matchup it was going to be for Keith
against Marty Lyons," says Munoz. "Well,
I can say to this day is that
Keith did an outstanding job."
Robinson left USC after the 1982 season to take over the Rams. "We
brought a lot of the same stuff to the Rams that we had been running
at USC," he says. As at USC, Robinson developed offensive linemen and
a featured tailback, in this case a 6' 3", 220-pound blend of speed and
power named Eric Dickerson, who entered the NFL the same year Robin-
son did and rushed for nearly 7,000 yards in his first four seasons. He ran
behind the likes of right tackle Jackie Slater, who would land in the Hall
of Fame, and six-time Pro Bowl center Doug Smith, who made the L.A.
power series hum. But by the end of the '80s, the Rams were learning a
different system altogether. It was called zone blocking.

ofthe defense against itselfEach offensive lineman, insteadoffiringforward
andblocking the defender directly infront ofhim, slides in one direction,
together with the others— "like on a railroad track,"asAnthony Munoz
describes it. In an outside zone scheme, as the defenders chase theplay, the
offensive linemen use thatmomentum to carry themfarther outside, spreading
them, which opens running lanes. The quarterback takes the snap andruns
wide to make a direct handoffto the tailback. Once the TB receives the ball, he
reads thegaps in the defense and cuts upfieldwhen he sees an opening.

It's all the rage in the modern running game, but don't try to
tell an old hard-core offensive line coach it's a revolution
field at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. They had gone through
a light session under a rising morning sun; a much more stressful after-
noon workout would follow, under more painful conditions. No energy
was wasted as players walked slowly off the artificial turf onto the asphalt
path that led to air conditioning, medical treatment and food. It was eerily
quiet, except for the occasional Colts fan beseeching an autograph. And, of
course, the ear-splitting engine noise when 67-year-old offensive line coach
Howard Mudd roared off the field in a four-wheel all-terrain vehicle.
Golf carts are everywhere at a pro football practice, with all manner of
support personnel scooting about; small flatbed tractors are common too,
for transporting tackling dummies, Gatorade buckets and, on bad days,
injured players. But Mudd has raised the vehicular bar, tearing around
the Colts' camp in an open-top roadster that looks as if it belongs in some
sort of extreme sports competition. "When we finish talking," says Mudd,
"I'll get this thing up to speed for you. We can even go back on the trails,
if you're interested. There are some great trails around here."

ging his wounded body into old age with little complaint, he could play one
on television. He has the barrel chest and broad shoulders of a faded offen-
sive lineman, a middle gone soft over the years, a right knee swollen and
scarred grotesquely by no fewer than three total knee replacements. His
face is leathery and reddened by four decades of training-camp summers;
a gray-and-white beard finishes the package with a professorial touch that
is fully appropriate given his standing in the O-line community.
Mudd, who grew up in Midland, Mich., played on the offensive line
at Hillsdale College from I960 through '63, then spent nine seasons in
the old school NFL trenches: six with the San Francisco 49ers, three
with the Chicago Bears. He played in three Pro Bowls but went out in
'71 with a knee injury that still hounds him today.
He coached offensive linemen at the University of California in his
first two years out of the NFL and took his first coaching job in pro foot-
ball at the age of 32, with the 1974 San Diego Chargers. He has been in
the league ever since and has spent more time watching large men's back-
sides than most people spend watching television. He knows blocking.
In the language of football, certain terms become part of the ver-
nacular overnight, or seem to. "Zone blocking scheme," and
its rel-
atives
"inside zone
play" and
"outside zone
play," have suddenly
become ubiquitous, often exalted as something brand-new. Yet there
has been considerable commentary in the coaching community—some
of it downright dismissive— as to whether there is anything at all new
about zone blocking. Hell hath no fury like an old coach being told that
a thing is new when he's been watching it for decades. Zone blocking
is one of those things.
Jim Hanifan, who coached NFL offensive lines in the 1970s, '80s
and '90s (and was head coach of the
St. Louis Cardinals from '80
through '85), says, "I get a kick out of people saying zone blocking is
something new. Yeah, it's new all right.
It's only been around for 50
years or more.
It's part of the game. Some people are acting like
it's
part of a revolution. Bullshit!"
Hanifan played at the University of California in the early-to-mid-
1950s and shortly afterward coached high school football in California for
seven seasons. "And I coached zone blocking there," he says. "We've been
using it forever." Hanifan's insistence—shared by almost every old school
126

ZONE BLOCKING
O-line guru in the sport—grows from the hazy definition of the term. It
sounds simple enough: zone blocking. Different from man-to-man block-
ing. But, of course, it's more complicated than that.
"Zone blocking has always been there," Mudd says. "Maybe people
called
it something else, but
it's always been part of the game." Here
Mudd becomes the teacher. He is sitting in his turbo golf cart in the glare
of summer, but he might as well be in a classroom, writing on a white-
board with a grease pencil. He grabs his "pupil's" notebook and pen and
begins sketching diagrams to explain what it is and to postulate on its
heritage. In football evolution, few areas are grayer than zone blocking.
But let Mudd explain the basics:
"Man blocking is just what is sounds like," he says. "You've got one
man blocking another man. When the play gets called in the huddle, the
offensive player has an assignment, to block a particular player on the
other team. That's man-to-man blocking, and you really don't see a lot
of that anymore. Zone blocking, well, in the simplest terms, the offen-
sive players are blocking an area. Instead of trying to block a particular
player and move him to a particular place, they're blocking whatever is
in front of them."
Anthony Munoz, an integral part of the man-to-man blocking scheme
that fueled USC's famous sweeps, would later play left tackle on the
'80s Cincinnati Bengals teams that brought zone blocking into the NFL
mainstream. "Think of it this way," says Munoz. "If you're man block-
ing, you've got this guy across from you, number 71. You're job is to
block him. That's your man. Zone blocking, you're on a track, like a rail-
road track, with your buddy, or all your buddies on the offensive line. If
a defensive lineman or a linebacker crosses onto the track, your job is to
take him and move him."
As the offensive linemen, working in unison, take advantage of the
defenders' own momentum, the running back, following, reads those
blocks before finding his seam and hitting it. The best thing about zone
blocking schemes," Munoz continues, "is that it doesn't matter what the
defense is doing. You can use your strength and your power to your ad-
vantage. You can say, 'Let's not see where the defense wants to move to;
let's dictate where they go by where we move along that track and then
use their movement against them to create seams.' "
127

The concepts of zone blocking have, indeed, been a part of football
since the turn of the 20th century. (And, arguably, before that; after all,
the flying wedge was technically a zone blocking play, albeit with inter-
locked limbs. A group of players, arm-in-arm, ran up the field plowing
over anything in their way, without regard to any personal blocking as-
signment.) Pop Warner's single wing was rooted in double teams and
trap blocking rather than pure body-on-body blocking. Tubby Raymond's
Delaware wing T was also built on a foundation of traps and team blocks
or "buddy blocks."
Among the first mainstream college coaches to effectively use the mod-
ern concepts of zone blocking was Bill Yeoman at Houston. It was Yeoman
who began running the veer in 1965, using what were essentially zone
blocking techniques, even if they weren't called that at the time, for more
than a decade. And through the '70s and '80s, at both the college and
the NFL level, as defenses became so much more sophisticated—linemen
slanting and stunting in ever more unpredictable ways—it became nearly
impossible for an offensive lineman to simply block the man across the
line because often that man wasn't rushing directly at him. Offenses
needed some way to counteract these more elaborate defenses.
HOWARD MUDD arrived in Cleveland in 1983 to work as the Browns'
offensive line coach under Sam Rutigliano. The Browns went 9-7 in that
first year and won just one of their first nine games in '84; Rutigliano was
fired and replaced by defensive coordinator Marty Schottenheimer, an
old-school former AFL linebacker who would build a successful coaching
career on the philosophy that the best way to win was to use the running
game to pound the football. For the '85 season he charged Mudd with
rebuilding the Browns' offense into a power running machine.
Mudd will not take credit for inventing the NFL version of zone block-
ing. He says the Seattle Seahawks, where he coached from 1978 through
'82 under Jack Patera, had been using a few zone blocking plays. That
surely helped shape Mudd's thinking as he worked up his run game for
the '85 season. There was another influence too. When Mudd played for
the 49ers, one of the team's running backs was John David Crow (Heis-
man Trophy winner at Texas A&M in '57), near the end of his impressive
11-year NFL career. Mudd and Crow would later coach together with the
128

ZONE BLOCKING
San Diego Chargers in the mid '70s, and Mudd picked Crow's brain about
how running backs find holes.
Says Mudd, "One day I said to John David, 'What do you look at when
you're hitting the hole?' I asked him because we were always telling run-
ning backs, 'Look at the butt of the blocker you're following.' So
I won-
dered if that's what they actually did. John said,
'I'll tell you what: I'm
not lookin' at [the blocker]. I'm looking at that sumbitch that's gonna
hurt me.' Well, that really helped me because then
I realized that run-
ning backs aren't watching offensive linemen, they're watching defend-
ers. That's a big difference."
For Mudd
this signaled a change:
Instead of assigning
specific
blockers to open specific holes, why not try to have the entire offensive
line work as a flowing team, creating movement in the defense and
letting the holes open up wherever they opened and letting the run-
ning back see them. "I was thinking, Let's cover up their color with our
color," says Mudd, "and then encourage the ballcarrier to run toward
the defense and then go where they aren't going. Hit 'em where they
ain't, you could say."
Everybody
in
football
in the 1980s had played—or coached—the
wing T at some point in his career, Mudd included. He started there. "The
wing T is built on principles of the double-team block up front," says
Mudd. "So with Cleveland in 1985, what we installed was a system where
we tried to double-team at the point of attack, and as soon as the double
team is engaged, we would come off and get the 'backer on the second
level." This would become the bedrock of the modern zone scheme: flow,
double-team and release to the second level.
There was also a bonus. "Zone blocking
is easier to teach," Mudd
says. "There are fewer things that can go wrong because you're creating
this mush, where guys are working with the guy next to him and there's
just less space for things to go wrong. Now, with this, of course, you're
going to lose some of the techniques that
I grew up with—the angle
blocking and pulling. But it's just easier. Over the years I've been in so
many meetings where we said, 'Ah, hell, let's just zone-block
it.' And
that's what we did.
Another concept became apparent. Whereas running backs in the
old man-to-man blocking system would generally accelerate at the
129

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
snap and receive the ball—by toss or handoff—while running at full
speed, zone blocking schemes called for more patience.
"It became
important for the ballcarrier to have speed through the hole, not speed
to the hole," says Mudd.
The 1985 Browns started four offensive linemen who had not been reg-
ulars in the previous season. They also started second-year man Earnest
Byner at tailback and rookie Kevin Mack at fullback, and each rushed for
more than 1,000 yards, the only double-thousand backfield in the NFL. A
year later the rushing numbers dipped, but with Bernie Kosar at quarter-
back, the Browns reached the AFC Championship Game (losing to John
Elway and the Broncos on "The Drive") and eventually strung together
three straight double-digit-win seasons.
THE LEAGUE was watching. In Cincinnati 42-year-old Jim McNally was
half a decade into his first NFL coaching job, handling the offensive
line for head coach Sam Wyche. McNally, who would become one of the
most respected O-line coaches in the game, already had anchors at left
tackle (Munoz) and right guard (Max Montoya). In '86 he started imple-
menting Mudd's zone system with the Bengals. "Howard Mudd really
ran one play, an off-tackle play, exceptionally well with a zone scheme,"
says McNally. "We copied that play and ran it a little wider, starting with
[running back] James Brooks."
In fairness to McNally, it's not as if he'd been sleeping on the sideline
for five years. He had seen the defenses increasingly attacking gaps in
the offense, making
it more difficult to block for a traditional man-to-
man running game. "When defensive lines started to pinch and slant,"
says McNally, "you'd get a situation where a [defensive end, or tackle in a
3-4 alignment] would line up over your tackle and he would slant to the
inside. Well, your guard is firing out to get the linebacker, and the slant-
ing defender would pick him off." That would kill the play, often letting a
linebacker shoot the gap untouched.
McNally's answer was to have his linemen take a step backward with
one foot—counterintuitive to everything linemen had been previously
taught—and then launch into a series of lateral double teams. In the sum-
mer of 1986 McNally introduced two movements to his offensive line: the
"drop step" and the "bucket step."
130

ZONE BLOCKING
Munoz was part of those early practice field sessions and recalls, "Peo-
ple were asking, 'How can you run-block when you're taking a step back-
ward?' I remember a couple years later, the Rams were putting in a zone
blocking system, and [Hall of Fame tackle] Jackie Slater called me and
said, 'Anthony, they want me to start by going backward! I want to fire out
and hit somebody.' I told him that's the beauty of the drop step and bucket
step. Once you learn to do them properly, you're stepping backward to get
your hips in position to move, but your shoulders are moving forward.
When everybody takes that same step and gets moving on that track, you
look like a bunch of dancing bears. But it's effective."
It took two seasons for the Bengals to become
efficient with the
scheme. James Brooks rushed for 1,087 yards in '86, and the Bengals
went 10-6. A year later they slipped to 4-11 in a strike-interrupted sea-
son, but in '88 the Bengals were an offensive machine. Brooks, a 5' 10",
180-pound scatback from Auburn, rushed for another 931 yards, but
it was rookie Ickey Woods, a 6' 2", 231-pound battering ram, who ex-
ploded behind McNally's dancing bears.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick says, "To be a great running back in the
NFL, you've got to be a truly instinctive runner." Woods, for one season,
was truly that: He had superb instincts for following the nascent zone
blocking, seeing and feeling the seams and bursting through the hole (as
Mudd would have it). Woods rolled up 1,066 yards, 5.6 yards every time
he touched the ball. The Bengals led the NFL with 2,710 yards on the
ground, nearly 200 more than any other team.
Woods became famous for his Ickey Shuffle touchdown dance, which
he performed 15 times in the regular season and three times more in the
postseason. Using McNally's zone blocking scheme in combination with
Boomer Esiason running Sam Wyche's no-huddle offense, Woods and
the Bengals won the AFC title and lost to San Francisco in the Super
Bowl 20-16. (Ickey Woods would tear his left ACL in 1989; he never
returned to the form that made him a one-season superstar.)
IN THE 1990s zone blocking became ever more prevalent. Theories
abound on why this happened. Bruce Coslet, who was offensive coor-
dinator on the Wyche-McNally Bengals teams of the late '80s, suggests
the reason was that linemen kept growing larger, becoming less ca-
131

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
pable of executing the man-on-man blocks that characterized so many
earlier running schemes.
"They couldn't trap, they couldn't pull and they couldn't run," says
Coslet. "Before the early '80s everybody was running sweeps and using
angle blocking and trapping. But as linemen got bigger and bigger, you
just couldn't do that stuff. Our linemen with the Bengals, we called them
the Road Graders. They would just knock the shit out of the guy in front
of them with a double team, and then whoever got off that block would
get to the second level and knock the shit out of the linebacker. That's all
zone blocking was for us."
Mudd doesn't disagree. "In a sense, we've lost a lot of the tech-
niques I grew up with," he says. "The taking angles, the trapping. And
there's no question that when you get people 340, 350 pounds, they're
not going to be able to run around the corner and leverage people.
They just can't."
But there is a middle ground where many offenses have taken up
residence. While
it's true that many NFL offensive linemen of the
1990s became almost grotesquely outsized and opened holes more
or less by leaning on defenders, Munoz argues that the most effec-
tive zone blocking is accomplished by big, but not massive, men who
can move. "We had guys in Cincinnati," he says, "who weighed 300 to
310 pounds, and you had to be nimble and agile to run the system. You
had to move, and you had to get to the second level."
The
direct descendant
of
Bill Yeoman, Howard Mudd and Jim
McNally is Alex Gibbs. A former running back and defensive back at Da-
vidson, Gibbs started coaching offensive linemen at the age of 34 when
he took a job at Ohio State under Woody Hayes in 1975. His greatest
impact would come more than two decades and eight jobs later, when
he coached the Denver Broncos' offensive line from 1995 to 2003, under
head coach Mike Shanahan.
Gibbs installed a zone blocking scheme that relied not only on
adroit movement and double teams at the point of impact but also—
controversially—on cut blocks at the second level. In a four-year period
starting in 1995 and culminating in back-to-back Super Bowl victories
to end the '97 and '98 seasons, Terrell Davis ran for 6,413 yards. Eight
different offensive linemen started at least 14 games for the Broncos;
132

ZONE BLOCKING
all of them weighed less than 300 pounds. They were quick and ath-
letic, and if their cut blocking rankled opponents who deemed it dan-
gerous and career-threatening,
it was also well within the rules. No
less an authority than Munoz says, "Cutting has always been a part of
offensive line play. Those guys at Denver in those years did a terrific job
of getting to the second level."
Gibbs, who became the Houston Texans' offensive line coach, remains
at the vortex of NFL offensive line play. As for the question of whether
there is or isn't anything new about zone blocking, Gibbs, like his peers,
surely has opinions; but he's not the one who will resolve that debate—he
doesn't grant interviews.

middle anda shallow cross on the inside. The lone receiver on the leftside
simply reads the defense andruns awayfrom the coverage. The quarterback
makes the same read; it is up to him to decide which ofthe three receivers
presents the best target. Three-step drop, quick decision, delivery.

THE SPREAD
OFFENSE
How Mouse met Tiger, horrified the football establishment
phones on the table—one for close friends only and the other for lesser
acquaintances. This was early in the summer of 2005, and Vince Young
was poised somewhere between urban legend and mythic hero. Five
months earlier he had led the University of Texas to a Rose Bowl victory
over Michigan, setting the stage for a run at the national championship
in the fall of '05.
Young represented vastly different things to different constituencies.
To die-hard fans of the Longhorns, he was a savior, a modern-day James
Street, a quarterback who would return the Horns to their rightful place
at the top of the college football world. To inner-city football players, he
was the image of survival, an athlete who refused to be dragged into any
of the many evils infecting his Houston neighborhood—and who also re-
fused to be moved from quarterback to any other position on the field.
To pure football fans, he was the next link in the evolutionary chain of
offensive innovation.
Young watched himself on a video screen in the basement of the
Texas football facility. Outside the room the hallways were lined with
and—40 years later— made Vince Young famous

plaques celebrating Texas's proud football history; at the far end of the
building was a sprawling weight-training center, where players came
and went seemingly all day long. Up on the screen came images from a
Texas victory over Kansas the previous fall, Texas trailing 23-20 with
just more than a minute to play and facing fourth-and-18 on its own
45-yard line. From out of the shotgun Young ran right to the corner of
the formation, darted farther outside and made a lone defender miss
a tackle before running out-of-bounds with a 22-yard gain that would
lead to a game-winning touchdown pass five plays later. "Me and one
guy trying to make the tackle," Young says. "I like that matchup. I just
gave him a little two-step."
Another game, this one on a home Saturday night against Oklahoma
State. The Longhorns had fallen behind 35-7, embarrassing themselves
in front of a well-oiled home crowd. Young brought them all the way back
to a 56-35 win and stamped the victory with a slaloming 42-yard touch-
down run with 6:57 to play. Again from the shotgun, Young slid the ball
briefly into the belly of the lone running back, Cedric Benson, then pulled
it out and ran to the outside. "The outside guy takes me, I give it to Ced,"
says Young, explaining the mechanics of the play. "If he slants real hard
to get after Ced, then I keep it and go to the corner. He slanted real hard."
It is a sequence that would become endemic to Saturdays in the fall (and
even some Sundays).
The video session lasts for more than an hour as Young takes a
visitor through the high points of his redshirt sophomore season.
It
all has the feel of something different from ordinary football, as if the
University of Texas and Young had discovered a new way to play an old
game: A shotgun snap, a quarterback running wild or throwing from
elongated formations.
It was the result of a process long under way when Texas signed
Young out of Houston's Madison High in February 2002. What would
come to be known as the "spread offense" had percolated in various
forms at various locations for more than half a century before Vince
Young turned
it into a highlight film at Texas. Dutch Meyer coached
at TCU from 1934 through '52, and among his quarterbacks were the
legendary Sammy Baugh ('34-36) and Heisman Trophy winner Davey
O'Brien ('37-38).
136

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
Meyer embraced the idea of using the full breadth of the football
field in ways that now seem obvious but were radical notions at the
time that he began with them. In his landmark manual Spread For-
mation Football, published just after his final season at TCU in 1952,
Meyer wrote:
We found that by moving out both ends and two or three backs,
it
became imperative for the defense to scatter too. As a result the entire
defensive line was spaced so much wider that natural holes were cre-
ated and much of the power blocking necessary on closer formations
was no longer needed.
Regarding
the
passing
game
from
spread
formations,
Meyer
concluded,
".
.
.
it can be quickly seen that potential receivers, placed
out from the main body of the formation and away from a congested
defense, can move rapidly into the opponent's secondary and will have
much freedom of movement as they deploy into set patterns."
MEYER'S WRITING, in
its
simplicity, neatly described the essence of
spread football: Make the defense cover the entire field.
Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
is a football junkie who
found his comfort zone. In 37 years of coaching at two high schools
and six colleges, Davis has never worked on the defensive side of the
field. In his world defenders are one-dimensional cutouts that have
only fronts, but no backs. They are just letters squeaked onto a white-
board with a Sharpie. "I was a high school and college quarterback,"
Davis says. "I've always been fascinated by offense and the ways you
can find to move the football." For the majority of his career, what that
involved was the forward pass.
He coached Gary Kubiak at Texas A&M and they remained close
as Kubiak climbed the college and NFL coaching ladder. Under head
coach Mack Brown at Texas, he helped make dangerous passers of Ma-
jor Applewhite and Chris Simms. But in the early years of the new cen-
tury Davis saw change unfolding. He saw Rich Rodriguez employing
a wide spread offense as offensive coordinator at Tulane and Clemson
and then as head coach at West Virginia. He saw Urban Meyer take
Utah into the BCS with a combination run-pass game. And in 2002
137

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
he signed Vince Young, a 6' 5", 195-pound quarterback with a gift for
open-field running.
"His mother said to me, 'You're not going to have my son just drop-
ping back and passing the ball, are you?' " says Davis. "I said, 'No ma'am,
we're not just going to do that.'
On Jan. 4, 2006, Young led Texas to a 41-38 victory over USC in
the Bowl Championship Series national
title game. He passed for
267 yards, ran for 200 more and, with 19 seconds to play, bolted
nine yards for the winning touchdown, denying the Trojans a third
consecutive national crown. Young was dazzling, and he looked like
something new, a startling change in the game. Yet it was a change
imagined long before that night in Pasadena. Vince Young was simply
the perfect result.
Portland, Ore.
Autumn 2008
SUMMER IS gone early in the Pacific Northwest; a cold wind ripples
across the urban campus of Portland State University, tucked into the
southwest corner of the city. The Vikings play football games here in
a minor league baseball stadium but practice on a field hidden among
academic buildings and dormitories at the center of the campus, in-
visible from a block away. On a September morning the team shuffles
off the field at 9:15 a.m. after an early-Thursday practice; last to leave
the field are coach Jerry Glanville and his offensive coordinator, Darrel
(Mouse) Davis.
Wrapped in a black windbreaker, Davis throws his arm around a
visitor. "You want to get some breakfast?" he asks him. This is what
Mouse does after nearly every single morning practice: He walks off
the Portland State campus, then two blocks to the corner of 6th and
College and through the doors of the Cheerful Tortoise, a musty, dark-
wood saloon that serves a rib-sticking breakfast. Mouse takes a seat
near the front of the room, orders two basted eggs, hash browns and,
after much more consideration than one might expect from a man who
calls football plays every 40 seconds under duress, chooses sourdough
toast over wheat.
138

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
At the age of 76 Davis revels in the sudden and vast popularity of
all spread offenses because three decades ago, when he was rolling up
ungodly numbers with quarterbacks like June Jones and Neil Lomax at
Portland State, he was accused of crimes against football by the keepers
of a staid game.
"At my age," he says, hoisting a fork and stabbing at the eggs on his
plate, "it's nice to know that I'm not a complete fucking idiot after all."
Mouse—and it's best to dispense with "Darrel" right here and now
because nobody calls him that—is also an honorable man. For decades
journalists and coaches alike have attempted to credit him with the
creation of the run-and-shoot offense. (Sometimes this was a compli-
ment, but often it was not.) Just as quickly as the title was bestowed,
Mouse would make a correction. And he does it again now. "This stuff,"
he says, "it all started with Tiger Ellison." And the story of how Mouse
Davis came to find Tiger Ellison is a classic case of football socialism:
Everything belongs to everyone, especially the diagrams on a board or
the plays on a film.
Mouse was one of five siblings who grew up together in the town
of Independence, Ore. They all had nicknames: Birdie, Blackie, Tean-
cie, Tickie and Mouse. (In 1979, SPORTS iLLUSTRATED's Kenny Moore
wrote that "Their mother's call to dinner sounded like an appeal for an
exterminator.") Mouse was the youngest, and he earned his nickname
by failing to grow. He was 5' 6" and 135 pounds as a high school senior,
too small to play quarterback. But he did. Certainly he was too small to
play quarterback in college, but he did that too (at what is now Western
Oregon University). He became a coach immediately upon graduation
in 1955, and by '62 he was the head coach at Milwaukie High in the
suburbs south of Portland.
Mouse ran a basic
I formation, with a tight end, slotback and wide
receiver, and he was forever trying to use players like himself, of which
there was no shortage. "Little pissants," he says. "At Milwaukie in 1962 I
had a lot of good players, but they weren't big, physical players. That's the
case at a lot of high schools. More of your good athletes are little pissants.
Good athletes, but small.
"As a coach, everything you do comes from some previous experience,"
Davis continues. "At different parts of my playing career
I had been a
139

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
quarterback and a receiver. And I was a little pissant. So my attitude was,
you take the little guys and put them out in space and they're pretty good.
You put 'em in a slug-it-out kind of game, they're pretty average. So we
were putting them out in space."
On a spring Saturday in 1965 Davis was doing a series of "car clin-
ics" with a group of his coaching buddies. "You do a clinic, jump in
the car and go do another clinic," he says. "That's why we called them
car clinics." En route from one stop to the next, one of Davis's col-
leagues handed him a book entitled Run and Shoot Football: Offense of
the Future, written by one Glenn (Tiger) Ellison. Davis read the book
and it resonated instantly.
The forward was offered by Woody Hayes, who wrote:
I lured Tiger Ellison away from Middletown, Ohio, where he was firmly fixed
in a coaching position he often said he would never leave. He was totally
dedicated to the town and to its high school, most especially to its football
program. I got him in 10 short minutes with one long word: dedication.
"Ellison," I said, "you're the forward-passingest coach in the country,
and they say I'm the most non-passing coach that ever lived. Yet I want
you at Ohio State because of the one thing you possess: dedication—to
your family and to your school and to your community and to the great
game of American football."
In [this] book Ellison goes further toward opening up the game than
any other coach I have known. His daring departure from traditional foot-
ball will amaze you. But I have seen his teams play.
I have studied their
movies. His fantastic offense had fantastic success. It is a crowd pleaser.
You could almost bet every year that his quarterback would make the
all-state team. Yet those quarterbacks seemingly possessed only average
physical ability.
I suspect that their success can be wrapped up in one
word: dedication—to their coach and to their cause.
I am sure that every coach regardless of the level on which he works will
profit from a study of the revolutionary ideas expressed in this book.

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
GLENN ELLISON had met Woody Hayes when they were football
teammates at Denison University. In 1933 Ellison returned to his
home of Middletown to join the staff of his high school coach, Elmo
Lingrel, as a line coach and the school's faculty as an English teach-
er. (Apparently his work in the classroom was often as compelling
as his work on the practice field. His youngest daughter, Carolyn,
later wrote of him, "Glenn decided to make poetry
.
.
. come alive. He
would recite several poems to [his students] and ask them to listen
for the drumbeat in
it and to tap the drumbeat out on their desks.
That drumbeat was a pulse beat that gave it excitement, a heartbeat
that made poetry come alive!")
After 12 years as an assistant coach, Ellison succeeded Lingrel; he
would coach the Middletown varsity for 18 years and adopt a familiar
persona for a mid-20th-century high school coach:
all hellfire on the
practice field (hence his nickname, Tiger, bestowed in his very first
year as an assistant) and all inspiration off it, filling halftime locker
rooms with Rockne-esque oration, leaving young men willing to run
through walls on his behalf.
And his teams won, consistently. But in 1958, his 14th season as a
head coach, everything turned sour. Middletown went 0-4-1 in its first
five games. Not since the school began playing football in 1911 had
it experienced a losing season, but with five games remaining, that
result seemed a distinct possibility. Ellison had long coached smash-
mouth football. In his book he would write, "Our motto was: 'Hit 'em
so hard and so often with so much that they simply cannot stand up
in front of us!' This was serious football. We lifted weights all winter,
ran our hearts out all spring and dug ditches all summer to prepare
for the fall grind."
Now, suddenly, this utilitarian approach to the game had failed Ti-
ger. So, in a desperate attempt to save the season, he turned in a com-
pletely different direction. He concocted a thoroughly nontraditional
offense that he called the Lonesome Polecat, in which the center lined
up alone on the ball and the rest of the offensive line was split out
far to his left, two receivers far to his right and the quarterback alone
in a shotgun formation. The quarterback was encouraged to scram-
ble and to find open receivers. Middletown won its first game 34-0
141

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
and finished the season with five consecutive victories. "The Lone-
some Polecat taught us that an average passer with average receiv-
ers can move the football" wrote Ellison. "Average boys can become
better-than-average passers and receivers
if their coach will permit
them to throw and catch."
Following the
'58 season Ellison refined the Lonesome Polecat
into something better, something more sound. In his book he says the
Polecat "revealed that football can be fun and that fun football can
win ball games," but also that
it was "a departure into insanity, an
escape from reality." Still, Ellison was committed to this new brand of
football. He took many of the Polecat's basic principles and applied
them to his new offense.
His previous offense had had one passing play—called the run-
and-shoot—so that's what he named his new one.
It had 20 runs
and 20 passes. Middletown lined up in a double-slot formation with
two split ends uniformly 17 yards from the ball, but no closer than
six yards from the sideline. Blocking schemes were identical for
runs and passes, so as not to tip off the defense, and Ellison made
a sincere effort to make "every pass look like a run and every run
look like a pass."
It is impossible to overstate the degree to which this was different
from the norm. Middletown used the run-and-shoot for 4V2 seasons
and with it won 38 of 45 games. Ellison's team won one game 98-34;
over the life of the offense, the team punted an average of just 1.2
times a game.
When the time came seven years later to write the story of his new
offense Tiger Ellison did not cheat his readers by thinking small. His 2/2-
page introduction begins like this:
This
is the story of a revolution. A revolt started in the mind of a
football coach and ended in a new order of things on the football
field. The
revolution awakened
a
sleepy community
into wide-
eyed enthusiasm and caused a veteran coach, squirming with frus-
tration on the threshold of his
first losing season, to wake up and
enjoy life to
its fullest. In the wake of that revolution came an ex-
plosion of touchdowns popping at the rate of one touchdown ev-
142

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
ery ten plays or five touchdowns per ball game for four years.
.
.
.
[And later, this:] "Yet, have you been lately to the football sta-
dium where you found twenty-two musclemen with their heads on
each other's shoulders pushing and pulling and howling and growl-
ing while somewhere beneath them hidden from view was the oval-
shaped 'bone of contention?' The only time you saw the football
was when one side kicked
it over to the other side. What you were
witnessing was a sample of possession football the way it has been
presented to the public the past dozen years, ever since the rules
makers unwittingly foisted upon the colleges the horse and buggy
football which became the vogue in the early '50's. Three-yards-and-
a-cloud- of-dust football returned to the American gridiron because
the college coach found
it no longer expedient to divide his squad
into offensive and defensive units with each unit spending its entire
practice time perfecting the fundamentals of that particular phase of
the world's most intricate teamwork sport. The coach had to split his
practice time, half for offense and half for defense, even though there
has never been since the game began quite enough practice time to
get an offense polished to perfection.
.
.
. High school coaches,
al-
though not restricted by the new rules, nevertheless followed suit
because coaches are copy-cats, and high school coaches, including
me, tend to copy the colleges.
[And finally, this:] However, the future of this great game suddenly
looms bright because football can now start growing up again, for the
college rules makers have recanted—two-platoon football in our col-
leges is back on the American scene. College football will soon become
the greatest sports spectacle of all time, provided college coaches will
open their eyes and stir their imaginations and put the oval-shaped
ball on display before those who come to see exciting entertainment.
I was a high school coach for thirty years. For the first twenty-five
and a half years
I was a possession coach, a slave-driver, a blood-
and-thunder guy, a coach whose constant motto on the field and in
the classroom and at home was: 'Root, hog, or die— dig, little pig, or
starve to death!'
I have changed. The revolution came. This book is the story of
that revolution.
143

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
THIS WAS the book that was handed to Mouse Davis during his car
clinic in the spring of 1965. Already predisposed to run a spread
formation that would free up his pissants to run amok, Mouse took
Ellison's theories—and even more than that, his formations—and es-
calated his own attack. He spent the last 12 years of his high school
career using the evolving run-and-shoot. His last team, at Hillsboro
High, won the 1973 Oregon State Championship. A year later he was
the offensive coordinator at Portland State, and a year after that, in
1975, he was the head coach.
In Davis's first season in charge, quarterback June Jones threw for a
then-Division II record of 3,518 yards (a record that stood for a decade)
and over two seasons averaged 266.2 yards a game in total offense.
Jones's successor, Neil Lomax, became the alltime NCAA Division I-AA
total offense leader (Portland State had jumped up one division) until
being surpassed in 1994 by Steve McNair. Football purists recoiled. Da-
vis adopted a casually defensive posture. "We were told that this wacko
offense would only work in high school," Davis told SI in '79. "So it was
fun to succeed with it in college."
Now Davis likens the run-and-shoot to the triple option in one key
way: "With option reads and with run-and-shoot pass routes, the of-
fense gets the chalk last," he says. That's coachspeak. The expression
derives from the practice of coaches scheming offenses and defenses
together on a chalkboard, passing the chalk back and forth in response
to each other's moves. He who moves last has the advantage. All of
the elemental run-and-shoot plays involved option— or readable—pass
routes, where the receiver is reacting to the defense and the quarter-
back is reading the receiver. Says Davis, "I get to keep the chalk even
after I snap the ball."
The core philosophy of the run-and-shoot never changed. "The whole
thing is, when you boil
it down," says Davis, "if I play a pissant, you've
probably got to cover me with a pissant. And the more of the field that you
use, the cleaner your reads."
In the Cheerful Tortoise, with breakfast finished and the plates
cleared away, Mouse takes the visitor's notebook and diagrams a play.
He scribbles four wide receivers, each of whom breaks off the line of
scrimmage. As he draws in the notebook, Davis explains that each re-
144

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
ceiver then determines his next cut, based on the reaction of the de-
fense. The quarterback
is simultaneously reading the defense and
throwing to a spot where the receiver should be. For more than three
decades, when it was well-executed, the run-and-shoot was a gridiron
symphony when it worked well.
Yet there was loud and predictable criticism of the scheme at ev-
ery turn. Mouse was further from the football mainstream than Tiger
Ellison had been from Woody Hayes. "People said our offense was
unsound" says Davis. "They called
it flag football. That's because
football has very conservative roots, and coaches have traditionally
been a very conservative lot. You ought to be able to knock some-
body's head into the dirt or you're not a real football coach. That was
the thinking."
Mouse left Portland State after the 1980 season. In the ensuing years he
had two opportunities to implement the run-and-shoot in the NFL: with
the Detroit Lions from '88 through '90 as offensive coordinator under
Wayne Fontes and from '94 through '96 with the Atlanta Falcons as quar-
terbacks coach under his old Portland passer June Jones. Neither venture
was ultimately successful. The Lions under Fontes and Davis went 15-22
in 2% seasons, and the Falcons with Jones and Davis went 19-29 in three.
Still, five Falcons receivers went over 1,000 yards in those three seasons.
"Both places," says Davis, "we moved the shit out of the ball."
But
it was in Houston that the run-and-shoot really moved, with
three different teams: the Houston Gamblers of the United States Foot-
ball League, the Houston Cougars of the NCAA and the Houston Oilers
of the NFL. For nearly a decade, beginning in 1984, Houston was run-
and-shoot central.
Former NFL linebacker Jack Pardee coached in
all three places.
With the Gamblers both Davis and a tall, cocky Texan named John
Jenkins—nearly nine inches
taller than Mouse—were offensive as-
sistants. The quarterback was Jim Kelly, who would later take the
Buffalo
Bills to four Super Bowls while running a slick no-huddle
(Chapter 21) as one of the last NFL quarterbacks to call his own plays.
"I
tell everybody
I learned the passing game from Mouse Davis in
Houston," says Kelly.
He had been a college star at Miami but says, "I had never learned
145

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
proper footwork. I had never learned to throw on the run. When I got to
Houston, I was almost starting from scratch. But Mouse, he was almost
like a college professor with me. He had a way of explaining the run-and-
shoot that let you really understand the reads and the options.
I was a
believer from Day One."
Kelly left the ill-fated USFL after the 1985 season. Pardee also
left that year and took Jenkins with him in '87 to the University of
Houston, where Jenkins installed the run-and-shoot. In the '89 sea-
son Andre Ware passed for a then-NCAA record 4,699 yards—an
unheard-of number—and won the Heisman Trophy, prompting an
outcry that a gimmick system had hijacked college football. It would
get worse. (Or better.)
When Pardee went to the NFL in 1990, Jenkins took over the
Cougars and rode the run-and-shoot to a 10-1 season in which they
scored more than 50 points five times and on the night of Nov. 17 in
the Astrodome beat up on Eastern Washington 84-21, with Hous-
ton quarterback David Klingler throwing 11 touchdown passes. Three
weeks later in a game in Tokyo, Klingler shredded Arizona State for
716 passing yards. Both records are still standing to this day. Comfort-
ably. In a Sports Illustrated story that was written in the sum-
mer of 1991 Cougars assistant Tony Fitzpatrick said, "Jenks is so far
ahead of everybody else, it's a joke. Mouse comes in here now, looks at
our films and even he doesn't understand them. Spreading the field?
Mouse had [the Gamblers'] slot guys split arm's length from the tack-
les. Jenks would have them start their routes over by the Gatorade
carts if they could."
The epilogue is less glorious. Jenkins's second and third Houston teams
went a combined 8-14, and by '93 he was gone.
But Pardee proved that the run-and-shoot could be employed ef-
fectively in the National Football League. From 1990 through '93,
with Warren Moon at quarterback, the Oilers averaged more than
10 wins a season and went to the playoffs in four consecutive years.
Other devotees always returned to
it. When June Jones became the
head coach at the University of Hawaii in 1999, he installed the run-
and-shoot and went on to win 75 games in nine years, while quar-
terbacks Timmy Chang and Colt Brennan rang up dazzling numbers.
146

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
From 2004 through '06, Davis was one of Jones's assistants before
returning to Portland.
Football archeologists understood that even when the run-and-shoot
did not lead to big victory numbers, it always advanced the cause of in-
novative offense. As an even more compelling measure of its worth, the
run-and-shoot became immensely popular with high schools populated
by Mouse Davis's physically overmatched pissants. Tiger Ellison would
have been proud. A revolution, indeed.

by its effectiveness. Defenses werejustgetting accustomed toplaying against
four-widepassing offenses, and the bubble screen was a totally unexpected
new wrinkle. The action is all on the three-wideout side. At the snap the
two outside receivers run inside-leaning routes, in effect taking away at
least two inside defenders and creating left-side space. The inside receiver
uses a slip move into the backfield, movingforward then looping back, a
bubble-shapedpattern thatgave theplay its name. The quarterback hits the
bubble receiver with a quickpass and the receiver turns upfield where the

THE ONE-

An L.A. high school coach took a chance and launched
an offense— andJohn Elway and Drew Brees with it
and they speak a language that nobody else really understands.
It
is
their way of finding normalcy. But it's also a way of staying in the endless
loop of innovation. Friends do not hide discoveries from each other.
In the spring of 1979 Joe Tiller and Jack Elway met up at a bar not
far from the campus of San Jose State University, where Elway, then
47 years old, had recently been named football coach. Though 11 years
apart in age, the two had become tight while working together in the
early '70s on coach Jim Sweeney's staff at Washington State; Elway
had gone on to a stop at Cal State-Northridge, Tiller took on a three-
year stint as an defensive line coach for the Calgary Stampeders of
the Canadian Football League and now was Calgary's assistant gen-
eral manager. He was scouting college players in California, and that
meant his trip to San Jose was a business expense, no small matter in
those days.
"First thing I do is go watch Jack's team practice," recalls Tiller (who
retired following the 2008 season after 12 seasons as a head coach at
Purdue). "And he's got guys spread all over the place on offense. Now,

when Jack and I had coached together at Washington State, we were
a splitback veer team, triple option football, like a lot of teams were
playing then. All of a sudden Jack is doing this one-back offense with
people spread out all across the field.
"So after practice Jack and I went out for a couple of pops for me-
dicinal purposes," Tiller says. "Someplace near the campus. Naturally,
we're talking about football because that's what football coaches do.
And
I always thought Jack had a great football mind, so I'm curious
about what I saw his team doing in practice when I'd been there. I say
'Jack, I'm really intrigued by what you're doing here. Where did you
learn this stuff?'
Elway had to be thinking that was a pretty funny question. The
answer was something that Tiller couldn't have expected. "This is the
stuff that John ran in high school," Elway told his friend. "I talked with
John's coach a couple of years ago, and I decided this stuff might work
at the college level. So I put it in."
Their conversation echoed one that Elway had had two years earlier
when he'd gotten a phone call from Mike Price, who had also worked
with Elway at Washington State and was still an assistant there. Price
asked Elway what he was running. "Never mind what I'm doing," El-
way said. "You should see the stuff my son is running. They're killing
people, just killing 'em. I'm putting this stuff in next year."
John Elway, future Super Bowl winner and Hall of Fame quarter-
back with the Denver Broncos, was running a spread-out, pass-happy
offense at Granada Hills High in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley. His coach
was Jack Neumeier.
Neumeier was from the same generation as Tiger Ellison, a tough,
old school football man. "Jack was a three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust
guy," says Darryl Stroh, who was introduced to the coaching business
by Neumeier in I960, his first year at Granada Hills. "He was tough on
kids. He believed in being tough on kids."
Stroh recalls a practice in which two Granada Hills players started
fighting each other while still clad in full equipment. Neumeier whis-
tled the scrap to a halt and then ordered the team to stand in a circle
while the two combatants stripped off their helmets and pads before
continuing with the fight. "Once kids realized they were going to have
150

THE ONE-BACK SPREAD
to settle their fights without pads and helmets," says Stroh, "we had a
lot fewer fights."
Neumeier's strategic turning point came in 1969, when Granada
Hills lost two close, low-scoring games in the regular season and failed
to make the Los Angeles city playoffs. Granada Hills had a terrific de-
fense and a steady offense, but that wasn't enough. Failure tore at
Neumeier. "Jack was about ready to hang himself after that year, he
was so distraught," says Stroh.
There would be a radical change. In the summer before the 1970
season Neumeier called a meeting with his returning starting quarter-
back, Dana Potter. "He told me he'd read a book by some high school
coach in Ohio," says Potter. (That book was almost certainly Tiger El-
lison's handbook on the run-and-shoot.)
"He said we were going to throw 35 passes a game. I had a hard time
imagining that happening because at that time nobody was throw-
ing the ball in Southern California. But sure enough, when the season
started, we were throwing it like crazy. We were starting games in the
two-minute drill. After a while we didn't even bother to look at film of
the other team's defense."
Granada Hills won the city title with the wide-open spread game in
1970, and six years later John Elway arrived as a tall, skinny running
back and switched positions. He would one day tell The Denver Post,
"[Neumeier] was the guy who made me fall in love with football at the
quarterback position."
Where Neumeier had once stressed physical dominance, he now
became a tireless student of the passing game. In a 1990 interview
with the Los Angeles Times, Neumeier explained his system: "Basical-
ly, my offense spreads the defense across the field," he said. "A lot of
teams will spread the defense the depth of the field, like the Raiders
for instance, but my idea is to spread them from sideline to sideline so
you never get two defensive backs to cover one receiver. And when you
catch the defense in a one-on-one, the receiver would go to an open
spot and should get there before the defender because he knows where
he's going."
Neumeier taught the system not only to John Elway but to Elway's
father and to a coach named Dennis Erickson. During his time at
151

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Granada Hills, Neumeier lived with his family in a house overlooking
the San Fernando Valley. "So many times I would go up there to visit
him," says Potter. "And he would be just sitting in the den, in the dark.
His wife would let me in the house, and I'd walk into the den, and Jack
would flip on the light and say,
C
I was just thinking about something
with the offense.'
Neumeier was gravely ill with cancer when he attended John Elway's
Hall of Fame induction on Aug. 8, 2004. "Jack was on his last legs, but
on that trip he just came to life talking about football and memories,"
says Stroh. Less than a month later, on Sept. 1, 2004, Neumeier died at
the age of 85. His football legacy would outlive him by decades.
The meeting at the bar between Tiller and Elway happened almost
20 years after Tiger Ellison had begun spreading the field in southwest
Ohio but not long after Mouse Davis had installed the run-and-shoot
at Portland State. The offenses were not identical: Neumeier's package
often used a tight end, Davis's did not. But their systems unquestion-
ably shared central themes influential to this day: Spread out the de-
fense. Get favorable matchups in coverage. Create running lanes. Get
the chalk last.
In five years at San Jose State, Jack Elway went 35-20-1, including
three wins over nearby rival Stanford. But it was one of his assistants,
Erickson, who would take Neumeier's offense nationwide. Erickson
had been a feisty three-year starter at quarterback at Montana State
(under the same Jim Sweeney, who would later mentor Elway, Price
and Tiller
at Washington
State). Erickson joined Elway's San Jose
State staff in 1979; a decade later he had won the first of two national
championships at Miami.
On his way to Miami, Erickson took his offense—which came to
be known as the "one-back spread" to Idaho and then to Wyoming.
"There was a time when everybody was running the 'bone, and so
people in Wyoming were happy with
it," says Joe Tiller, who came
to Laramie to work as an assistant in '87. "But Dennis came in and
threw the ball all over the place, and people loved it." Erickson left for
Washington State after just one season, but his offense he had brought
stayed in place; when Tiller became head coach at Wyoming in '91, he
did nothing to change it.
152

THE ONE-BACK SPREAD
"I had no choice; they loved what Dennis had done," Tiller says.
"People have asked me for years how I learned this offense. I tell them,
'Dennis left his playbook at Wyoming.' And that's absolutely the truth."
At Washington State, Erickson turned the Cougars around from 3-7-1
in 1987 to 9-3 in '88 and their first bowl bid in 56 years. In one game
Erickson took the Cougars to Ann Arbor to play Michigan and trailed
only 13-10 at the half before running out of gas and losing, 44-18. But
Washington State happened to throw for 334 yards and completed 61%
of its passes against the staid Wolverines. "I can't believe what you did
with that gimmick offense," Michigan coach Bo Schembechler com-
mented to Erickson after the game, a backhanded compliment if there
ever was one.
Erickson remembers these years as a kind of free pass into the end
zone for Neumeier's offense. "It was new, and nobody really knew how
to cover you, so nobody did," says Erickson. "We'd motion a guy out
of the backfield, and nobody would cover him, so we'd just throw him
the ball, and he'd go 70 yards for a touchdown." His teams exploited
matchups as few had done previously in college football. A college
linebacker in the '80s couldn't cover a slot receiver or a running back
in motion, and defenses weren't accustomed to trying.
Still, Erickson, like Mouse Davis, had to
fight for respect. Says
Tiller, "When he was at Idaho, people would say, 'That's just Divi-
sion I-AA.' Then he goes to Wyoming and well, 'That's just the wacky
WAC Then, 'Washington State is the Pac-10; they all throw it around
out there.' I don't think the offense really had much credibility nation-
ally until Dennis got to Miami. And then, wow."
The Hurricanes won national titles in Erickson's
first season in
Miami, 1989, again in '91, then lost the national title game in '92.
Gino Torretta won the '92 Heisman Trophy operating the one-back.
Not only did the Hurricanes throw, but they also ran. The one-back
forced defenses into such wide formations that massive holes opened
in the middle of the field. Coaching staffs from far and wide descend-
ed on the fields in Coral Gables to watch and learn. "One year we
must have had 20 staffs on campus at the same time," says Erickson.
"We shared everything."
Other Elway disciples, meanwhile, went forth with their own ver-
153

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
sions. Mike Price, in 1997, took quarterback Ryan Leaf and Washing-
ton State to the Rose Bowl. The statuesque Leaf (long since better
known for dueling Tony Mandarich as the biggest NFL Draft bust in
modern history) operated the spread one-back from a shotgun with
no tight ends. Price recruited athletes for the team from all over the
Los Angeles basin. He turned them into wideouts and then tested de-
fenses with deeper throws than any coach had previously tried with
this offense. Said Price, "I don't see anybody out X-ing and O-ing us.
We might miss blocks, drop balls. But if the offense is run right,
it
can't be stopped."
Tiller had his chance in that same year, when Purdue hired him to
bring the spread passing game to the Big Ten. It was an unqualified
success. Nine times in 12 seasons the Boilermakers won at least seven
games, and with future NFL star Drew Brees running the attack, they
went to the Rose Bowl after the 2000 season.
In 1997 Tiller and his quarterbacks coach, Greg Olson, enhanced
the Neumeier offense by adding what came to be known as the "bub-
ble" screen. To run the bubble, there are three wide receivers flanked
to one side; the two outside receivers run inside patterns, essentially
either walling off their defenders or running them deep. The inside
receiver slips back into the backfield to receive a short forward pass
and take the ball upfield. Says Tiller, "It's not too complicated. The re-
ceiver kind a makes a little forward movement and then loops around
backward, kind of like in the shape of a bubble. So we called
it a
bubble screen."
Defenses were ill-prepared against the bubble. Linebackers accus-
tomed to stopping the ground game or blitzing would invariably over-
run it; defensive backs were suckered away from the play by the deep
receivers. The bubble screen would become one of the most popular
and enduring innovations in the game.
Purdue's bubble made
its debut on the second weekend of the
Tiller era, which had begun with a loss at Toledo. Playing at home
against Notre Dame and protecting a narrow lead in the fourth quar-
ter, Purdue faced third-and-one near midfield. "Notre Dame is used
to seeing Mike Alstott [the bruising Boilermakers fullback] bang
over the A gap," says Tiller. "Instead of that, we decide to throw the
154

bubble screen and Vinny Sutherland goes for about 30 yards. The
stadium just erupted."
Purdue's win that day over the Fighting Irish helped shove the Big
Ten into the modern era of wide-open football. Watching that game
from the sideline was a Purdue freshman named Drew Brees would
become the starting quarterback for the Boilermakers the following
year. And there in West Lafayette, Ind. ? more than three decades after
being designed by a desperate high school coach a half a continent
away, the offense found its perfect triggerman.

Spread offense aficionados HalMumme andMike Leach made this a
standardplay, their variation on the "four verticals" espoused by Norm
Chow atBTUin the mid- 80s. The quarterback sets up in the shotgun with
four wideouts, two on each side, and one running back, in strictlyfor blitz
pickup. At the snap, allfour receivers work straight up thefield, reading
defenders. As the receivers are moving the quarterback, on a three-step drop,
is quickly reading theplay either left to right (1 to 4) or right to left (4 to 1).
Ifeither ofthe safeties sits down on a route, the ballgoes deep up the seam.
Ifeither ofthe cornerbacksplays soft, the ball immediately goes short. The
plays effectiveness is basedon thepressure continuallyput on the defensive
backs to make decisions, with the quarterback then exploiting those decisions.

BYUAIRRAID
the arrival in Lubbock of head coach and passing game provocateur Mike
Leach in 2000, the Red Raiders of Texas Tech had used a four-wide shotgun
attack to not only reconfigure the country's offensive statistics but also chal-
lenge longtime bullies Oklahoma and Texas for supremacy in the Big 12.
Behind quarterback Graham Harrell and wideout Michael Crabtree,
Texas Tech won its first 10 games of the '08 season, including an epic
39-33 upset of Texas on the first Saturday night in November. That was
the night football nation first truly understood the miracle that Leach had
wrought in the plains of West Texas. Three weeks later the Raiders' na-
tional title hopes were snatched away by a very good Oklahoma team, but
a statement had already been made. In the land where the wishbone was
invented, where smashmouth football had long been worshipped on Sat-
urday afternoons, a freewheeling, pass-crazy, scoreboard-popping offense
had garnered not only success but also respect.
Texas Tech's invention was really a reinvention. Thirty-two years ear-
lier, and 900 miles from Lubbock, the Cougars of Brigham Young had
begun turning the passing game into an art form, forever altering the
college game. Among the many young coaches watching was Mike Leach.
Brigham Young hired LaVell Edwards as coach in 1972, and before long
he had assembled a staff in Provo perfectly suited to the needs of a pass-
An all-out, pass-happy system was born and raised in

first offense. Norm Chow (who would later tutor Heisman Trophy winners
Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart at USC, as well as Philip Rivers at North
Carolina State) handled receivers and called plays beginning in '82. Roger
French created clever blocking schemes. And Doug Scovil coached quarter-
backs and oversaw the offensive operation from '76 until '80, when the Cou-
gars' quarterbacks were Marc Wilson, Gifford Nielsen and Jim McMahon.
"Doug Scovil put it all together," says Robbie Bosco, who was BYU's
starting quarterback in 1984 and '85 and coached under Edwards for
14 years after finishing his eligibility. "When
I was being recruited [in
'81], Doug had just gotten the head coaching job at San Diego State, so he
was leaving BYU. I went there to visit, and he put his arm around me and
he made it clear to me that it was his offense, and Coach Edwards never
disputed that. Coach Scovil said to me,
cIf you want to be like all those
quarterbacks at BYU, you need to come here.' "
Among other coaches who passed through Provo were Brian Billick,
Mike Holmgren and Andy Reid, all ofwhom would later excel as offensive
coordinators and head coaches in the NFL. And all of them would run
some form of the West Coast offense, making clear that permutations of
the West Coast system were influenced by the Provo think tank. However,
the wide-open spread passing game that Texas Tech had unleashed in
Lubbock was a direct descendant of the offense born in Utah, and it had
come to Mike Leach by way of a coach named Hal Mumme.
In the spring of 1986 Mumme became head coach at Copperas Cove
High in Texas, 70 miles northwest of Austin, in the midst of some of the
best high school football in the country. Mumme was 34 years old and at
last he had his chance to be a head coach. So he would do it his way. "Back
in 1982, when I was the offensive coordinator at UTEP," says Mumme,
"we played BYU, and
I just had tremendous admiration for everything
they did on offense. I decided that if I ever got to be a head coach, I was
going to do what they were doing up there. Some people, when they get
to be a head coach, pick a little from this team and a little from that team.
Not me. I was going to run BYU's stuff."
Mumme put himself on a shuttle between central Texas and north-
ern Utah. "Hal was here

BYU AIR RAID
the intricacies of the Cougars' offense. And
it was a thing of beauty.
Consider two of the basic plays:
Scat route In BYU parlance any form of this play was called "scat ball." It
could be run from various formations but always keyed on releasing sev-
eral receivers and a running back and then sending a flanker directly over
the spot from which the ball had been snapped. "That way, says Bosco,
"the quarterback would know exactly where the receiver was going to
be. The short, quick pattern was dubbed a "scat" route. "When we were
playing our best," Bosco says, "we completed that ball probably 90 or 95
percent of the time. And I'm talking over an extended number of years."
Bosco would also see the play on Sundays. "The 49ers," he says, "ran that
play thousands of times." The 49ers called it Flanker Drive, but the execu-
tion was very familiar.
Draw trap An enduring image of the BYU offense is of a steady succession
of passes, followed by a draw play straight up the middle for huge yardage.
"Our best running play, bar none," says Bosco. "Teams would come and
watch us practice the draw trap, but that was our puppy. There were days
when we would rep that play for 20 minutes straight. I'd get tired just from
handing the ball off. But in games, if teams were blitzing us, sometimes I'd
hand the ball off and look back, and I'd think, Man, that's a big hole."
Everything in the offense was run from a spread formation, with wide
line splits. And Hal Mumme loved everything he saw. He took it back to
Copperas Cove, installed it immediately and made a struggling program
much better. "One day," Mumme recalls, "I was sitting in Norm Chow's
office, and he says to me, 'Now, Coach, how do you run four verticals? I
said,
cWe don't run four verticals.' Chow says, 'Coach, if you're not going
to run four verticals, you might as well not use the offense.' So we started
running four verticals. Only we just called it '6.' Because what are you try-
ing to do? You're trying to go get six points."
Mumme created a frenetic practice drill called Routes on Air, in which
five quarterbacks were all throwing passes to five lines of wideouts (instead
of the customary one quarterback throwing to one receiver, with all the oth-
ers standing around waiting their turn). As an added twist, something he
picked up from watching a 49ers practice on a visit west, Mumme would
have every receiver run all the way to the end zone after catching the ball.
He moved up quickly, from Copperas Cove to Iowa Wesleyan to Val-
159

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
dosta State to Kentucky, where Mumme's system—by then called the Air
Raid—got national exposure. The Wildcats won only 10 Southeastern Con-
ference games in Mumme's four years there but beat LSU twice, scared
everybody else and led the conference in passing for four consecutive
seasons. Florida's Steve Spurrier had shaken the SEC to its conservative
roots in 1990 when he brought his Fun 'n' Gun offense to Gainesville, but
Mumme had taken it a step further with far less talent at his disposal.
At every stop where Mumme coached, one of his top assistants was
Mike Leach, who had been a rugby player at BYU in the early '80s and had
watched the same offense that Mumme so admired; but this was long before
they met. Leach took a circuitous route to Mumme's side, a bizarre trail even
by coaching standards: from BYU to law school at Pepperdine to the U.S.
Sports Academy in Alabama to the College of the Desert in Palm Desert,
Calif., to the European Football League in Finland. But as soon as he got a
taste of the Air Raid offense, he became Mumme's enabler. "He was the guy
who would walk up and down the sideline getting in my ear," says Mumme.
"He was always saying, 'Keep attacking, keep attacking. Stay aggressive.'
When Bob Stoops was hired as Oklahoma's head coach in 1999, he
brought in Leach to run his offense, the first coach to bring the wide-open
offensive philosophy to the Big 12. "Kentucky was hard to play against
when I was at Florida," says Stoops. "I wanted to do that to other people."
Under Leach, Oklahoma averaged nearly 37 points a game in '99, 20 more
than in the previous season. When the Sooners won the national title a
year later, Leach had already left for Texas Tech, where he put together
everything that had been handed down to him—from Dutch Meyer to Ti-
ger Ellison to Mouse Davis to Doug Scovil to Hal Mumme—and turned it
into one of the most eccentric offenses the game has ever seen.
"Frankly," said Mumme in the fall of 2008 as Texas Tech rolled to its
10-0 start, "Mike is doing a better job with this than I ever did."
Leach's career has been fueled by a relentless curiosity, and he's always
let his oddball instincts thrive. One example among many: On a summer
evening in 1989 he was sitting in his apartment in Mount Pleasant, Iowa,
watching NFL videotapes with other Iowa Wesleyan assistant coaches.
Leach became obsessed with the 49ers' "smash" route, a high-low hori-
zontal pass pattern in which two receivers essentially try to confuse a
cornerback, and the quarterback reacts to the confusion.
160

BYU AIR RAID
Leach wanted to know what the indicators are for reading the play,
so he jumped in his car and drove six hours to a Packers minicamp in
Green Bay where he knew the offensive staff were keen to those routes. "I
remember it really well because Tony Mandarich was there," says Leach.
"Anyway, we wound up talking to Lindy Infante about the smash route,
and he said he thought they picked it up from the 49ers, but wasn't sure.
But he explained it, and we put it in at Iowa Wesleyan.
"And here's the thing," says Leach. "We would do the same thing if we
saw a high school team with a good play. We'd go talk to them about it. I
was a young coach, and I was excited about this stuff. Eighty-nine, that
was the summer of love for the spread offense."
The Leach system makes no pretense of conventional balance. His Red
Raiders passed the ball almost twice as often as they ran it. "To me," says
Leach, "balance is making sure all your skill players touch the ball."
Texas Tech's Air Raid (a name co-opted from Mumme with sheer af-
fection) was run out of a one-back set with five receivers.
It advanced
the Mouse and Mumme systems in its complete commitment to the for-
ward pass, with routes based not on timing but rather on a simultaneous
quarterback-receiver read. "Some teams like to go three-step drop and get
rid of it," says Leach. "Our way is to have the receiver find a hole, and we'd
tell him, 'We'll find you in that hole.' "
From Leach's arrival in 2000 through the '08 season (his tenure in
Lubbock would end in discord at the end of the '09 season), Texas Tech
won at least eight games a year with five quarterbacks and averaged more
than 530 yards of offense a game. Perhaps the most telling measure of the
Air Raid's efficiency is that none of those Red Raiders quarterbacks have
been successful in the NFL. They were, in fact, made by the offense.

THE ZONE READ
The blending ofthe modern spreadrunninggame with the venerable read
option is built on this core idea. Theprinciple is the same as that ofthe late- 60s
wishbone: Its easier to reada defenderandrun awayfrom him than it is to
block him. In the spread, though, that read is done behindzone blocking In the

to him. Upon taking the snap, the QBputs the ball in the belly ofthe running

THE SPREAD
OPTION
The game changed on a hobbled ball by an obscure
quarterback at a school you've never heard of
head coach at Glenville State College, a National Association of Intercol-
legiate Athletics (NAIA) institution in Glenville, W.Va., halfway between
Morgantown and Charleston. Rodriguez was just 27 in that first season
but already a veteran of sorts; he had been only 24 when he was named
head coach at Salem College. That school dropped its program after a 2-8
season. Glenville started no better in Rodriguez's first year, going 1-7-1.
During that same fall a young quarterback named Jed Drenning was
trying to find someplace where he could settle and have a college foot-
ball career. As a high school quarterback he had twice led Tucker County
High in Davis (a town of 624) to the West Virginia Class A state cham-
pionship. From there he had gone to Samford University in Birmingham
to play for Terry Bowden.
Drenning transferred after two seasons and sat out the '90 sea-
son while awaiting clearance to restart his career at the University
of West Virginia. Then came word that at Glenville, Rodriguez would
be running the multiple I formation offense, a staple of the Bowden
family of coaches and familiar and comfortable to Drenning, so he

switched again and rolled on down to Glenville to play for Rodriguez
in the fall of 1991.
There were more surprises ahead. "I get to campus for practice," says
Drenning, "and the first day on campus I run into Dean Hood, who was
our defensive coordinator. He says, 'Did you meet your offensive coordi-
nator?' And he's smiling, and I ask what's so funny, and he says they're
putting in the run-and-shoot."
Drenning was clueless as to how to operate the run-and-shoot, and
predictably, it was not an immediate success in Glenville. Entering an
October game against Wingate University in that first year, Glenville
State was 1-3-1; worse, Wingate had beaten Glenville 63-0 the previ-
ous season. Even more ominous—in fact downright frightening—was
that Drenning had been sacked 32 times in the previous two games.
Fearing for his health, Drenning was constantly bugging Rodriguez to
run from a shotgun formation, to at least give the quarterback an extra
beat to find receivers and an extra step of safety from the ferocious
pass rushes they were seeing.
On Monday before the Wingate game Rodriguez asked Drenning,
"How often do you want to run out of the 'gun?" Drenning answered,
"Coach, I'll run the clock out in the 'gun if you want." Glenville went to
the shotgun for the entire game and narrowly missed pulling off the up-
set, losing 17-15.
They stayed in the 'gun for the rest of the year, finished 3-1 down
the stretch and began shaping the offense that Rodriguez would so ef-
fectively run later as a coordinator at Tulane and Clemson and as head
coach at West Virginia. "Whatever incarnation of Rich's offense exists
today," says Drenning, "it was born that day when we played Wingate.
And he turned the place around pretty quickly after that."
There would be one more major invention. Rodriguez was not the
first offensive-minded coach to operate the run-and-shoot from a shot-
gun, but his next move was almost surely an original one.
It was the fall of '92, and Glenville was en route to a respectable 6-4
season while operating its run-and-shoot almost strictly from a one-
back shotgun. (Mouse Davis, back in the day, had never used a shot-
gun.) Included in Glenville's offensive package was a series of running
plays using zone blocking in which Drenning would receive the snap
164

THE SPREAD OPTION
and stick the ball in the gut of a running back lined up next to him.
One afternoon Drenning bobbled a snap on one of these zone-
blocked running plays. Unable to get the handoff delivered to the run-
ning back, Drenning tucked the ball himself and saw the backside
defensive end crashing down the line of scrimmage to tackle the run-
ning back—who, in fact, did not have the ball but was behaving as if he
did—from behind. On a broken play the quarterback customarily fol-
lows the running back into the assigned hole and tries to salvage yard-
age. But Drenning, seeing the end closing, instead ran wide into the
area vacated by the end. "It was just an instantaneous reaction thing,"
says Drenning.
After the whistle, Rodriguez casually asked Drenning, "Why did you
do that?"
"Do what?" said Drenning.
"Why did you run that way?" Rodriguez said.
"The end pinched," said Drenning.
Rodriguez nodded, as
if to say, Oh, uh-huh. This, as best anyone
can tell, was the birth of the modern "zone read," now a cornerstone
play in any run-based or balanced spread offense. It is the play that
essentially
fulfilled Jack Elway's wish—to add an option run to
a
spread passing game.
It is a play that, in effect, wed Tiger Ellison's
run-and-shoot to the Texas wishbone, because the zone read is simply
another version of the same read that triggers the wishbone triple
option. In the wishbone the quarterback reads the defensive tackle;
in the zone read he reads the backside defensive end, just as in Jed
Drenning's accident.
Glenville State rode Rodriguez's offense to 32 wins in his last four
years there, and then Rodriguez rode it into Division I—first at Tulane,
where he was offensive coordinator under Tommy Bowden in 1997 and
'98. The quarterback there was Shaun King, and the offense was made
vastly more flexible and complex.
"It wasn't really a run-and-shoot because we were 50-50 run and
pass," says King. "But in the passing game we had four wides, and we
tried to challenge vertically as well as spread the field. There was a lot of
two-by-two mirrored formation stuff [two wide receivers running mir-
rored patterns on each side of he field]. All of our runs had an automatic
165

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
slot check;
if the slot was uncovered on a running play,
I would just
throw it to the slot guy."
Rodriguez also tried to ramp up the zone read, but King, who was
an accurate thrower and a better athlete than Drenning, wanted no
part of it. "We put in the zone read," says King. "You don't block the
weakside defensive end. The quarterback reads that guy. But I never
wanted to keep the ball, because there was no blocker over there [to
protect me]. I told Rich not to call running plays for me. I said that if
nobody's open, then I'll run it, O.K.?" This happened often enough that
in 1998, when Tulane went 12-0, King became the first quarterback in
NCAA history to pass for 300 yards and run for 100 in the same game,
a 49-35 win over Army.
But at Rodriguez's next stop, Clemson, where he went with Bowden
in 1999, again as offensive coordinator, his quarterback was Woody
Dantzler. While he was a less capable thrower than King or Drenning,
he was a far superior runner. In 2001 Dantzler became the first col-
lege quarterback to pass for 2,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in the
same season.
By then Rodriguez had left for West Virginia to become head coach,
and there, in 2005, a quicksilver freshman quarterback named Pat
White proved to be the perfect pilot for the Rodriguez spread. In the
'08 season (and once again Rodriguez had already moved on, this time
to Michigan), White became the first quarterback in college football
to pass for 5,000 yards and rush for 4,000; twice he had thrust West
Virginia into the national championship race. "The genius of Rodri-
guez," says King, "is in the way he's used different quarterbacks. He
did things one way with me and then another way with Dantzler and
then another with Pat White."
Even as Rodriguez was busy reconfiguring offensive football, he had a
shadow. Urban Meyer is a year younger than Rodriguez. Meyer was raised
in Ohio, Rodriguez next door in West Virginia. But while Rodriguez was
twice a head coach at obscure schools before turning 28, Meyer was tak-
ing a more traditional path, working as an assistant at Ohio State, Illinois
State, Colorado State and, from 1996 through 2000, under Lou Holtz and
Bob Davie at Notre Dame. He got his first head coaching job in 2001 at
Bowling Green, the same year that Rodriguez got his third head job.
166

THE SPREAD OPTION
"When we got to Bowling Green,
I
felt like we were a
little under-
manned,"
says
Meyer. "So we
started asking each
other,
as
a
staff,
'How can we move the ball?' We tried to put together a combination
quarterback-run, passing game, with our entire goal being to create num-
bers for the offense. Where can we get an advantage?"
The philosophy was not unlike Rodriguez's: Try to balance a sophis-
ticated pass offense while making the quarterback a viable threat as a
runner. Against conventional offenses, defenses essentially ignore the
quarterback as a potential ballcarrier; if the quarterback becomes a run-
ning threat, a defensive player has to be assigned to track him, limiting
that defender's freedom to move to any other point of attack. "If you can
make the defense account for the quarterback," says Meyer, "that meant
one guy you didn't have to block."
Meyer learned much of his attack from two sources. The passing
game came from Louisville and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan
(who had played at Idaho for Dennis Erickson and would later become
head coach of the St. Louis Rams). Meyer had visited Linehan at Louis-
ville. "We went down there with the intention of staying one day," he
says, "but we stayed for about five days. We studied their whole pass-
ing game and the idea of spreading the field with five-man protection
and no backs."
Meyer's quarterback-run game was copied in large part from Kansas
State's offense of the '90s under coach Bill Snyder. When Snyder took
over the Kansas State program in 1989, the Wildcats were infamously
proclaimed by SPORTS ILLUSTRATED to be "The Worst Football Pro-
gram in America." In less than a decade K-State would contend for the
national championship.
The first steps in the climb came on defense, in which young assis-
tants like Bob and Mike Stoops (later the head coaches at Oklahoma and
Arizona, respectively) and Jim Leavitt (South Florida) put together an
unorthodox, high-pressure package that was effective on Saturday but
also all week long.
"They were very smart young guys, and they got us into what
I
thought was a very innovative defense," says Snyder. "They put a de-
fender in every gap, rolled up the corners and got eight men in the box,
and consequently, we were very, very good against the run. But as a
167

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
result of that, when we practiced against ourselves during the week, we
were not very good on offense. We had to get better.
"We had to create some running lanes, and the answer was pretty
simple: Involve the quarterback in the running game. So essentially
what we did was run every play that we had been using in the run game,
but we gave ourselves the option of running
it with the quarterback,
which forced the defense to account for him as a ballcarrier. That took
one man out of the box." The Wildcats had power plays and counter
plays and trap plays and, eventually, the zone read. They had talented
quarterbacks, most notably Michael Bishop, who led the Wildcats to the
Big 12 championship game in 1998.
More than one football historian has argued that Snyder, Meyer,
Rodriguez—and many others—were really running nothing more than
a modernized version of the single wing. Pop in a couple of DVDs,
watch both offenses at work, and it's clear that the argument holds a
lot of water.
Meyer took the Louisville passing game, mixed it with the Kansas State
run game, and won 39 of 47 games in four years at Bowling Green and
Utah, taking the latter to a BCS bowl after the 2004 season and finishing
the year ranked No. 4 in the nation. At Florida, with more talent than
most of his opponents, Meyer won the '06 and '08 national titles, and
in '07 quarterback Tim Tebow won the Heisman Trophy after throwing
for 32 touchdowns and running for 23 more, a statistic that eloquently
speaks to the balance of the attack.
Tiger Ellison would have loved those numbers, illustrative of where
his original master plan has taken the game. The question that follows
logically—and is routinely dismissed by coaches and pundits alike—is
whether the NFL will soon employ a spread game similar to the one that
prevails in college football, and whether quarterback runs would be part
of the system.
Many NFL systems are already rooted in the spread passing attack.
The New England Patriots went unbeaten in the 2007 regular season,
with Tom Brady often running out of a five-wide, empty-backfield set and
isolating Wes Welker—the ultimate version of Mouse Davis's pissants—
on linebackers who couldn't hope to cover him.
But Brady wasn't running the ball. "At the NFL level you invest an
168

THE SPREAD OPTION
awful lot of money in the quarterback," says Linehan. "And if you're go-
ing to run that college stuff, you're putting him in harm's way. But some-
body is going to come in and do it effectively. The Falcons did it some
with Vick. The Titans with Vince Young. NFL teams don't spend a lot
of time preparing to defend the option, so you're going to wreak havoc
with coordinators. And the team that incorporates the option effectively
at the NFL level, well, all bets are off."

TAMPATWO
Popularized in the late 9 0s by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers under coach
Tony Dungy and defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, the Tampa Two is
afull-defense (11-man) extension ofthe Cover Two secondary defense (a
four-man pass coverage "shell") that teams had usedfor more than two
decades. The Tampa version is the ultimate bend-don t-break defense,
designed to eliminate bigplays andforce the offense to methodically
drive the length ofthe field. Two deep safeties share the deep zones.
(The name "Cover Two" derivesfrom these two deep safety zones.)
The cornerbacks disrupt wideouts at the line ofscrimmage. The most
demandingposition is middle linebacker; he isforced to drop as much as
30 yards into the middle toprevent completions on deep crossing routes.

Chapter 16
THE COVER
TWO
As the long passing game began to run amok in the NFL,
frantic defensive coaches needed help; this was it
league changed course. Jan. 12, 1969: Super Bowl III, Jets over Colts,
establishing sudden
legitimacy
for
the American
Football
League.
Jan. 10, 1982: Dwight Clark and the Catch marks the beginning of the
Bill Walsh dynasty in San Francisco. Those are among the obvious
ones. But Jan. 23, 2000, would appear on very few lists of such dates.
Obscure as it may seem, though, it was a watershed evening in the his-
tory of the league, a day on which defensive ingenuity and execution
stymied the celebrated offensive revolution, in the process expanding
the lexicon of the sport. And the defense did all that without even win-
ning the game.
The St. Louis Rams had seized the NFL by its throat during the 1999
season. Offensive coordinator Mike Martz had stretched the bound-
aries of Don Coryell's daring vertical passing game (Chapter 6) and
rung up a league-high 526 points while winning 13 games, even after
a preseason injury to designated starting quarterback Trent Green.
His replacement, an obscure 28-year-old quarterback named Kurt
Warner, became the league's MVP. The Rams had scored 49 points on
St. Louis, Mo.

the Minnesota Vikings in the divisional playoffs and on this January
day would face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the right to represent
the NFC in Super Bowl XXXIV.
"There was a sense around the league that the Rams were pretty
much unstoppable," recalls Tony Dungy, who was then in his fifth
year as the Bucs' head coach. "And there was a real respect there.
Not just among the fans but among coaches, too. That was a very
good offense."
The Bucs had a defense that was very good too. Dungy knew
it,
and his defensive coordinator, 60 -year- old Monte Kiffin, knew it. The
Bucs had yielded more than 20 points in a game just four times. They
had become dominant, but offense sells. The Rams were expected to
roll, favored by two touchdowns.
They played a time warp game that night in the Trans World
Dome in St. Louis. Warner needed 43 attempts to complete 26 pass-
es for 258 yards (in the regular season he had needed only 31 at-
tempts on average to get more than 270 yards in a game). He was
intercepted by the Bucs three times. Warner had to settle for short
completions, and the Bucs ran to the ball in swarms, gang-tackling
and reducing damage. St. Louis drives stalled for lack of a big play.
Nevertheless, the Rams won when Warner squeezed a late-fourth-
quarter touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl into a tiny seam in the
Tampa Bay coverage. The final score was 11-6. The Rams went to
the Super Bowl.
The Bucs went into a different kind of history. "That day we just
played the same defense we'd been playing all season," says Dungy.
"And we did a pretty darn good job of keeping them out of the end
zone. This is a copycat league. People saw that game and started do-
ing what we were doing."
Six years later the copycat evolution of that Bucs defense looked
like this: Late in the
first quarter of a Sunday-night regular-season
game early in the 2006 NFL season, the Bears led the Seahawks, who
faced third-and-14 on their own 39-yard line. Seattle lined up in a
four-wide offensive set. The Bears' defense countered in a 4-3 set with
two deep safeties. It would defend the play in the conservative "Cover
Two" hybrid scheme now known as Tampa Two, so named because it
172

THE COVER TWO
took hold with Dungy's Buccaneers.
It had become the single-most-
popular defense in the NFL, a bend-but-don't-break system that forces
offenses to execute the length of the field five yards at a time. After a
season-opening shutout loss to Chicago, venerable Packers quarter-
back Brett Favre had said, "I think the Bears are the best that's ever
played that style."
In simplest terms, Tampa Two
is a zone defense with two deep
safeties playing Cover Two (each
is responsible for half the width
of the field), two cornerbacks jamming wide receivers at the line of
scrimmage, two outside linebackers patrolling the short zones and a
middle linebacker roaming from the line of scrimmage to as much
as 30 yards downfield, and four pass rushers. By the 2006 season
the defense was at the peak of its popularity. Jim Schwartz, then the
respected defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans, said at the
time,
"I'll bet you 30 out of 32 teams in the league play
it." Those
teams that most relied on the Tampa Two would employ it on as many
as 40% of their defensive plays.
On the play in that 2006 game, Seattle quarterback Matt Has-
selbeck took a five-step drop and threw toward slot wideout Bobby
Engram in the curl zone 10 yards downfield, slightly to the right of
center. The ball, Engram, Bears nickelback Ricky Manning Jr. and
linebacker Lance Briggs arrived simultaneously. The pass bounced
off Engram's hands as he was taken down by Manning and Briggs.
The Seahawks punted and lost the game, 37-6. It was a classic Tampa
Two stop, with the Bears' defense functioning precisely as designed.
"From now on we're calling it Bear Two," said Chicago's All-Pro line-
backer Brian Urlacher later that week. "Best thing about this defense?
It works, man."
It works, man, because it is the cumulative result of more than three
decades' worth of defensive progression. Follow along.
In the midsummer training-camp heat of that same season, Bears
head coach Lovie Smith stood on a practice field between two-a-day
sessions. He is one of the devotees of the Dungy-Kiffin system—he was
a member of that Tampa Bay staff during its run of defensive domi-
nance, and he took the Tampa Two with him to Chicago from St. Louis,
his intermediate stop. Smith knew as well as anyone that this was one
173

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
of those football innovations that may have seemed to arrive suddenly
but has roots deep in the game.
"I played Cover Two when I was in high school back in Texas in the
1970s," Smith says. "And they were playing Cover Two long before
I
got there."
Early Cover Two was straightforward. Two safeties split the field, far
from the line of scrimmage. It was the simplest way to defend the deep
zone in case the cornerbacks got beat, or in case the offense used more
than two receivers, which, until the 1970s, they seldom did at any level of
the game. Cover Two was uncomplicated and safe.
But as with any zone defense, there were holes: between the safeties
and outside the safeties. Generally, Cover Two allowed wide receivers to
roam relatively freely in the secondary. Defensive coaches began concoct-
ing ways to fill those holes. One was to roll the cornerbacks up close to the
wide receivers, disrupting them at the line to throw off the timing of pass
routes and allow the safeties more time to react. First to try it?
"Late 1960s, I was a quarterback with the 49ers, and we're playing
the Cleveland Browns," says longtime college head coach (and briefly
the Redskins' coach) Steve Spurrier. "John Brodie was the starter, and
he used to love to throw the quick out. Five yards, zip it right in there. If
the cornerback rolled up on one side, John would throw it the other way.
So in this game, John sees one corner rolled up, looks the other way,
and that corner is rolled up too. He comes over to the sideline and says,
'They can't do that!' I said, Well, they just did.' "
Former Michigan State head coach George Perles does Spurrier one
better: "In 1967, 1 was at Michigan State working under Duffy Daugh-
erty. We played Houston in the first game of the season. Bill Yeoman
was the coach there. They played Cover Two and rolled up the corners.
Beat us 37-7."
The great leap forward was initiated in the early 1970s by Bud Carson,
a slight man among the giants of the NFL. Like so many coaches who
impacted the game, Carson was born in steel country near Pittsburgh.
He played high school football and then at North Carolina. In '67, at the
age of 37, Carson succeeded the legendary Bobby Dodd as head coach at
Georgia Tech but lasted just five years, losing as many games as he won
(27-27). For the '72 season he was hired by Chuck Noll to be the Steelers'
174

THE COVER TWO
defensive coordinator. Carson could not have known that he stood on the
cusp of something big.
Noll was in his fourth year coaching the hapless Steelers, a franchise
known for being scrappy, but usually in defeat. They had improved
from 1-13 in 1969 to 6-8 in '71, slowly clawing at respectability. As
they climbed, the pieces of a legendary defense were coming together:
Defensive tackle "Mean" Joe Greene was selected No. 4 overall in '69,
cornerback Mel Blount in the third round in '70, linebacker Jack Ham
and defensive end Dwight White in
'71. On this foundation Carson
installed a basic Cover Two scheme, and then he tweaked it.
Capitalizing on the power of the 6' 3", 205-pound Blount (he was
really as much a linebacker as he was a defensive back), Carson
pushed the corners up to the line of scrimmage and instructed them
to jam wide receivers. The safeties—Mike Wagner and Glen Edwards
(or, when Edwards was hurt, Ralph Anderson)—were assigned to
cover deep zones behind the jamming corners. Outside linebackers
Ham and Andy Russell would cover vast space from hash mark to
sideline, and middle linebacker Henry Davis, a journeyman keeping
the seat warm for the Hall of Famer to come, would be required to
drop deep in the middle zone, sometimes 25, even 35 yards deep.
Using linebackers in deep coverage was a radical scheme, but
its
liberation of the rest of the defense would serve as a viable counter-
attack to the short-throw, possession-passing systems that were be-
ginning to proliferate, particularly Bill Walsh's so-called West Coast
offense (Chapter 8).
"Bud came in one day, I think it was early in the season," as Wagner
recalls, "and just drew it on a chalkboard. It was different, but I think
everybody in the room could see the potential right away. We went out
to practice that same day and started running it. And we loved it."
Ham, then just a year out of Penn State, says, "We actually played a lot
of Cover Two in college, but this was different. And obviously Bud could
see that we had the right people to play it."
Russell loved the concept and loved playing for the coach who gave it
to them, telling SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, "He's like a mad scientist, looking
for a formula and changing it every day."
The Steelers went 21-7 over the next two seasons, losing twice in the
175

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
playoffs. But they continued to add the right people to play Carson's cov-
er two. Cornerback J.T. Thomas was taken out of Florida State with the
first pick of the '73 draft; he was 6' 2", 196 pounds, only slightly smaller
than Blount and just as inclined to play a physical game. A year later
the Steelers used their second-round pick to take a skinny 6' 4" middle
linebacker out of Kent State named Jack Lambert. He was freakishly
skilled and also ferocious, and he proved to be the perfect Cover Two
linebacker: He had the speed to make the deep drops and the instincts
to know when to get there.
Carson's
core philosophy was
to
force an
offense
to
settle
for
short
gains
on
underneath
dump-off
passes,
requiring
the
of-
fense
to show
sustained
execution,
clock consumption
and,
per-
haps most
significant, patience. "There
are not a
lot of big plays
out there against this defense," says former NFL quarterback Rich
Gannon, who played from 1987 through 2004, in the heart of the
Tampa Two
resurgence. "You have
to be
patient and
take
four-,
five-, six-yard plays and work your way up the
field. That's some-
thing
coordinators
and
quarterbacks
don't
always
enjoy
doing."
Think of these as the Five Commandments of Tampa Two:
1) The front four must be able to rush the quarterback, allowing the
linebackers freedom. "If you get four men who can rush the passer,
you can play cover two, Tampa Two all day," says Ham. "But you can't
play it without a pass rush, because it's a zone defense, and there are
lots of holes
if the quarterback can sit back and wait." The Steelers
made their pass rush effective with Joe Greene and L.C. Greenwood,
the Buccaneers with Warren Sapp and Simeon Rice and the 2006
Bears— all the way to the Super Bowl—with Tommie Harris and Alex
Brown as part of an eight-deep posse of solid defensive linemen mov-
ing in and out of the game.
2) The middle linebacker must be able, and willing, to frequently drop
as deep as 30 yards, filling the deep crossing zone between the safe-
ties, and leaving many of the glamour plays—helmet-popping tackles,
interceptions—to the outside linebackers and the safeties. "My pri-
mary purpose in that defense is to run back to the huddle and con-
gratulate somebody for making a play while I was running down the
field with the tight end," says Brian Urlacher, who went on to become
176

THE COVER TWO
an All-Pro playing Tampa Two middle linebacker in the mid-2000s.
Urlacher refined the position played by Lambert. At 6' 4", 258 pounds
with running back speed, Urlacher could sit on the line longer than most
Tampa Two middle linebackers, allowing him to read running plays be-
fore bailing out, yet
still able to drop into 25-yard pass plays and dis-
rupt them. "He's a freak," said Bears quarterback Rex Grossman in 2006.
"Trust me. I play against him every day, and I test him. You can't throw
over him in the middle."
3) The outside linebackers have
to be smart enough and
athletic
enough to not only cover receivers in the middle zone but also to
rally to runs at the line of scrimmage. "You're not looking for your
old-fashioned linebacker who makes tackles in a phone booth," says
Dungy. "You're looking for an open-field tackier and athlete." Think
nickelback Ronde Barber with vintage Tampa Bay teams or linebacker
Lance Briggs with the mid-2000s Bears. The outside 'backers also
have to jam tight ends and slot receivers to keep them from releas-
ing into the middle zone vacated by the dropping middle linebacker.
In 2006 the woeful Detroit Lions hired Rod Marinelli from Tampa
Bay as their head coach, and Marinelli then drafted lightning-quick
230-pound middle linebacker Ernie Sims from Florida State to play
the Lambert-Urlacher role with the Lions.
4) The cornerbacks must be physical enough to jam wideouts at the
line of scrimmage and also to tackle ballcarriers. In Tampa Two they
are not expected to run down the field with receivers but merely dis-
rupt them and pass them along to the safeties. "I think one of the big
reasons Tampa Two developed was to take pressure off the corners in
terms of coverage," says former NFL quarterback and Monday Night
Football analyst Ron Jaworski. Yet the initial disruption is vital. "Our
job is to get our hands on the receiver and knock him off his route,"
says Charles Tillman, who played on the Bears Super Bowl team in
2006. "That little bit of a bump can change the whole play." Blount
was the prototype in 1972 and, all these years later, it is hard to imag-
ine a more ideal Tampa Two corner.
5) The safeties must be smart enough to break properly on balls
in the air and physical enough to create, and survive, the violent
collisions with wide receivers that happen when the safety has run
177

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
25 yards from his deep starting position. "This defense is the rea-
son you see so many penalties on safeties," says Ham. "They're out
there to create collisions."
CARSON'S 1974 Steelers played the first true, modern Cover Two defense.
It would be known far and wide as the Steel Curtain. While the Steeler
offense during the '70s dynasty was no slouch (Bradshaw, Harris, Swann,
Stallworth, Webster), it was the defense that was the heart of a franchise
that won four Super Bowls in six years. In 1976 (a non-Super Bowl year),
the Steelers gave up 28 points over the last nine regular-season games
and pitched five shutouts.
The
front four
of Greene, White,
L.C. Greenwood and Ernie
Holmes was almost unblockable even without blitz help from line-
backers. Ham, Lambert and Russell were as good as any trio of
linebackers that has ever played together. Thomas and Blount were
perfect Cover Two corners, Wagner a cerebral yet reckless
safety.
"The amazing thing," says Woody Widenhofer, a defensive assistant
with the Steel Curtain Steelers (as was Perles),
"is that Bud had
played a lot of two-man zone, but he looked at our personnel and
just adapted everything to it."
After the 1977 season Carson left Pittsburgh to join the Los Angeles
Rams. He would work as the defensive coordinator for the Rams for four
seasons, helping get them to the '79 Super Bowl. In '89 he was finally
given his own team, the Cleveland Browns, but lasted just a season and a
half as head coach before being fired in the middle of a 3-13 year.
Yet Carson not only earned an important place in coaching history
but was also a vital link in a coaching chain. Before the 1977 season, the
Steelers had signed University of Minnesota quarterback Tony Dungy as
a free agent and then converted him first into a wide receiver and then a
safety. He played two years for the Steelers, including the season of their
'78 Super Bowl championship. He also paid close attention. Dungy would
become one of the most successful coordinators, then head coaches, in
league history. At every turn Carson was in his head. "Everything we do
now," Dungy said in the fall of 2006, with his Colts en route to winning
the Super Bowl, "you can find in my Pittsburgh Steelers playbook. I did
keep it all those years."
178

THE COVER TWO
Dungy left the Steelers after two seasons, but by 1981, at the age
of 25, he was back in Pittsburgh as an assistant coach. He was the
Steelers' coordinator from '84 through '88 and assumed the same po-
sition with the Vikings in '92, where he met up with Monte Kiffin,
then a 52-year-old Nebraska native and coaching journeyman with a
jones for defense and some of the same ideas that Dungy was carry-
ing around in his old Steelers playbook. Offenses were getting better,
faster, more sophisticated; defenses needed an answer.
Like
the
best
coaches,
Kiffin
enjoyed
finding
answers. He
was
raised on Cornhuskers
football
in
Lexington,
Neb.,
in
the
south-central part of the state between Kearney and North Platte.
He took his game to Lincoln in 1959 as a two-way tackle and re-
turned in '66 as a defensive assistant coach under Bob Devaney. The
Huskers won national championships in '70 and '71, and a tradition
of defensive excellence— starters wore black shirts in practice and
became known as the Blackshirts even before Kiffin arrived—was
established.
Kiffin worked at Nebraska for 11 years, under both Devaney and
his successor, Tom Osborne. Then he did a typical coach's tour:
six
stops in 15 years, including a 16-17 record in three years (1980-82) at
North Carolina State, his only head coaching job, before landing back
in Minnesota. Dungy's arrival led to a marriage of like minds. Together
he and Kiffin modified Carson's old system, putting Jack Del Rio in the
crucial middle linebacker spot and rolling up the corners aggressively.
The Vikings made the playoffs for three straight years and in '94 led
the NFL in total defense.
When Dungy was hired as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
in 1996, he brought Kiffin aboard to run his defense. Together they re-
fined the Cover Two into a defensive force. "Tony and I had both used
a lot of the theories that became what everybody calls Tampa Two,"
says Kiffin. "He had learned some things with the Steelers, and I had
been playing some of it when I was coaching in college. We sort of put
them together." Their defensive mission was to close the traditional
holes in the Cover Two. All defenses have holes on paper, and theirs
was no exception.
They worked primarily at two things: One was finding the perfect
179

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
personnel, like tackle Sapp and outside linebacker Derrick Brooks,
whose ability to cover flat zones and rally to ballcarriers was crucial to
the Tampa Two—and almost unmatched in the NFL during Brooks's
prime. Second was improving the Cover Two against the run on a
consistent basis.
"And that's exactly what Monte did," says former USC coach Pete
Carroll, a lifelong friend of Kiffin's. "He made
it awesome against the
run. What Monte and Tony did in Tampa was almost revolutionize de-
fense. They took a good, simple system and made it very, very precise."
For years, Cover Two was played with an "under" front four. Under
signifies a shift to the weak (non-tight end) side of the offensive for-
mation. At Tampa Bay, Kiffin completed a transition to an "over" front
alignment, meaning that the defensive front four is shifted to the strong
(tight end) side of the offensive formation. "In the over defense you play
your linebackers more off the line of scrimmage," says Kiffin. "That puts
more emphasis on your seam droppers [outside linebackers and nick-
elbacks] to get into the flat zones. We had Derrick Brooks and Ronde
Barber playing those positions."
If the Tampa Two reached
its peak with Tampa Bay's Super Bowl
victory following the 2002 season, it remained a force with the Bears'
Super Bowl appearance in '06. Predictably, receivers evolved, becoming
better skilled at beating the essential jams at the line of scrimmage; at
the same time, officials became more diligent in calling penalties on
hand-chucks at the line.
Offenses began to find new holes to exploit. "There's a sweet spot
against the Tampa Two," Jaworski said in 2006. "Eighteen or 19 yards
on the sideline. But any less than 18, 19 yards, and the receiver is
still
jammed; and any more, and the receiver is in the hospital because the
safety came over to hit him. And it takes a great throw."
Quarterbacks became more adept at making that great throw. Re-
ceivers got better at making the catch and getting to the ground before
the concussive hit was delivered. "The biggest thing," says Kiffin, "was
that it got harder to catch teams off balance with the scheme. They had
a chance to study it."
In the spring of 2009 Kiffin suddenly left the NFL to return to the
college ranks as defensive coach at Tennessee, where his son, Lane,
180

THE COVER TWO
had become head coach. A year later Lane moved on, together with
his father, to L.A. to become head coach at USC—taking the place
of Pete Carroll, who has suddenly returned to the NFL to coach the
Seahawks. In the coaching world, these were seismic changes. But
one thing remained the same: both Kiffin and Carroll would still be
coaching the Tampa Two.

THE 46 DEFENSE
Out ofdesperation over the mediocre defensivepersonnel ofthe early- 80s
Chicago Bears, Buddy Ryan concocted the 46 defense (so-named by Ryan
spontaneouslyfor strong safety Doug Plank, whosejersey number was 46)
.
It is effective largely because it "covers"head-on the three interior offensive
linemen with defenders, dramatically reducing theprotectionpackages
available to the offense because the center and both guards had to block one-
on-one and could not move or help in another manner Ryan also overloaded
one side ofthe defense close behind the line,further confusing the offense
as to which defenders might blitz. It is a high-risk defense, with as many as
eight defenders in the box andjust a single highfree safety.

HE
SCENE
was
remark-
able not just because it was
poignant but also because
it was so unusual. The 1985
Chicago Bears had just finished off a 46-10 deconstruction of the over-
matched New England Patriots to win Super Bowl XX in the Louisiana
Superdome, and the giddy celebrations had begun on the field. Chicago
coach Mike Ditka, beloved by these Bears, was lifted onto the shoulders of
some of his players—this came as no surprise. But then the strangest thing
happened: Suddenly there was Bears defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan
being hoisted by linebacker Otis Wilson and defensive end Richard Dent,
Ryan's right leg over Wilson's left shoulder pad and his left leg on Dent's
right pad, both men laughing, while the rumpled old coach, stuffed into his
Bears sweater, awkwardly tried to keep his balance. A defensive coordina-
tor getting a victory ride?
Only once in the intervening years has a Super Bowl title been as
convincingly built on defense
(in 2000, by the Baltimore Ravens).
But the '85 Bears were more than their defense. They had become a
183

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
pop cultural phenomenon, with a celebrity coach, Ditka; a celebrity
quarterback, Jim McMahon; and a celebrity nosetackle turned tail-
back, William (the Refrigerator) Perry. They had released a kitschy,
funky video— The Super Bowl Shuffle—that was recorded long before
the championship game and had become a ubiquitous hit. And, to
balance the scales of fame against the frivolous, the Bears also had
the seriously gifted Walter Payton, maybe the best running back in
the history of the game.
Still, what pulled it all together into winning football was a defense
that redefined every essential element: strategy, speed and size, along
with intimidation. The '85 Bears went 15-1 in the regular season, los-
ing only to the Miami Dolphins on the first Monday night in Decem-
ber. Eleven times in 16 regular-season games they held opponents to
10 points or less. Statistics tell only a part of the story;
these Bear de-
fenders were scary-good, putting real fright into opposing players. In
the postseason they proved even more intimidating. The Bears shut out
the New York Giants (21-0) and the Los Angeles Rams (24-0) on con-
secutive frigid, windswept weekends at Soldier Field. The Giants and
Rams combined for a total of 311 offensive yards in eight quarters, with
four turnovers to the Bears' one. It was a display of domination seldom
seen at the highest levels of any major sport, and it matched perfectly
the city of Chicago's hard-ass self-image.
Behind this success was a 51-year-old football lifer whose only break
from playing and coaching the game he learned growing up in Okla-
homa was to serve as a master sergeant in the Army during the Korean
War. James David (Buddy) Ryan had been coaching football since he
latched on at Gainesville (Texas) High in 1957, but almost three decades
later in Chicago he created the perfect amalgam of coach, system and
personnel. Ryan had been hired by Bears head coach Neil Armstrong
in 1978, and he so inspired his defensive players that when Armstrong
was fired after three seasons, they successfully petitioned owner George
Halas to keep Ryan in place.
The single most important factor in Ryan's rise in Chicago came early in
his tenure there, while he was in the throes of frustration with the way his
unit was performing. Ryan devised a defense that moved balls-out safety
Doug Plank to middle linebacker. Ryan called it the "46" because that was
184

THE RYAN FAMILY DEFENSE
Plank's jersey number, and it would challenge evolving NFL offenses like
as no defense had before.
On the night before the Super Bowl in the Bears' team hotel in New
Orleans, the defense gathered, as it would on the eve of every game, for
the ritual viewing of one reel of inspirational game film. First Ryan gave
a speech; the players were well aware of the rumors that Ryan would be
leaving the team after the game (which he did, to become head coach of
the Philadelphia Eagles). "Quivering lip, tears, pretty emotional," recalls
Gary Fencik, the team's veteran safety and defensive captain.
The reel chosen by Ryan was film of a midseason game in which
the New York Jets were trying to play the Bears' 46 defense, having
poached the basic concepts from Bears tape. The Jets version was a
poor imitation of the real thing. Bears defensive end Dan Hampton
jumped from his chair. "I'm sick of watching the fucking New York Jets
try to run our defense!" Steve McMichael, the tackle who played inside
Hampton, took up the cause by heaving a folding chair so hard that it
became impaled in the chalkboard. "Then," says Fencik, "we went next
door and ate milk and cookies."
Less than 24 hours later they crushed the Patriots. And scored the kar-
mic total of 46 points.
Shelbyville, Ky.
April 2009
IT HAS been spring for a month on the calendar, but there is winter in
the air in the horse country of central Kentucky. A dark overcast sky spits
out periodic snow flurries. The Kentucky Derby will be run in less than
two weeks, but warm sunshine, fancy hats and mint juleps seem im-
possibly distant. Late in the afternoon Buddy Ryan pulls up in a dust-
covered pickup truck alongside a horse barn where he rents stall space.
He owns 16 horses—four broodmares, four yearlings born just this spring
and eight colts. They are not the type of horses bred to win the Triple
Crown, but they keep a man busy just the same. Ryan is wearing a Jets
windbreaker (in honor of his son Rex's recent hiring as head coach—as
well as his own first job in the NFL) and shuffling with a limp because a
horse stepped on his right foot a few days earlier. As he fills plastic feed
185

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
tubs, he stops to point out a January foal he's unofficially named Jetty.
Buddy moved here with his second wife, Joanie, in 1996, after the Car-
dinals fired him from what would be his last coaching job, but retirement
hasn't been all easy. Joanie was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2001,
and two years later Buddy moved her to an assisted living facility in Lou-
isville. "She's not doing good," says Buddy on this day. "But we go to mass
every Sunday, and she seems to like that, so it's O.K." In the winter of 2005
Buddy fought off a case of encephalitis. (Rex came down to Louisville and
raised hell with the hospital staff, telling them, "This ain't Johnny Bumfuck
you're treating here.") The illness left some holes in Buddy's memory, but
not when it comes to football.
It was a long journey that had brought Ryan to that evening in New
Orleans, sitting atop his players' shoulders, the most famous defensive co-
ordinator in football, and then carried him to this barn smack in the middle
of Kentucky's horse industry. The wind blows harder as Ryan moves from
stall to stall, filling the feed tubs and making sure the horses have water,
using a black rubber hose to fill up the pails.
The horses' names tell the story of Ryan's life. One broodmare is named
Bayside Girl, for Joanie, who was born and raised in Bayside, Queens.
Another mare is Fired for Winning, which happened when Ryan was dis-
missed as coach of the Eagles following the 1990 season. One colt,
still
actively racing at the time, is named Forty-Six Blitz. That one makes Ryan
smile. Buddy always wanted to raise horses, so when his coaching career
finally ended, he brought Joanie to the green hills and bought some stock.
After the horses are fed and watered—"put up," in the parlance of the
business—Ryan drops onto a couch in a cluttered tack room just off the
shedrow. Two wary cats scurry to cuddle at his feet. "So what do you want
to know about the 46?" he asks. "There wasn't all that much to it at first."
He laughs, because of course there was a lot more by the end.
Raised in the Oklahoma panhandle town of Frederick, Ryan was a
lineman on the local high school team, but after graduation, instead of
taking his game to college, he enlisted in the National Guard. "I went
in when
I was 16," Ryan told SPORTS ILLUSTRATED in 1986. "No one
had much money back in Frederick, so a bunch of us joined the National
Guard to get that extra $40 a month. Then the sumbitches went and mo-
bilized us." At 18 he was a master sergeant, leading a platoon in Korea.
186

THE RYAN FAMILY DEFENSE
Ryan was back home before his 19th birthday, a grown man, and a
lineman at Oklahoma A&M, which would later become Oklahoma State.
"I was more mature than most of the other players," he says. "You would
expect that." There he met his future wife, Doris, the homecoming queen,
and they were married while still in college. Buddy became a coach, first
in high school and then in college, 12 years at six different addresses.
RYAN'S FIRST NFL job was with the 1968 New York Jets. Weeb Ewbank
had three assistant coaches on that team, and Ryan ran the defense
that would eventually shut down the Colts 16-7 in Super Bowl
III,
shocking the football world. "We really weren't very creative on de-
fense with that team," says Ryan. "We played a straight 4-3 and tried
to gap teams a little bit. Offset some. Get off the ball quick." This would
become a Ryan signature, using linemen who were too quick off the
ball to be easily blocked to disrupt offenses trying to control the line
of scrimmage. On that Jets team, Ryan did it with defensive end Gerry
Philbin and tackle John Elliott.
"We had a great defense on that team," says Ryan, "but the coaches
didn't
call
nothin'.
[Middle linebacker]
Larry Grantham
called
all the
defenses. But there wasn't a whole lot to
it. Like
I said, we weren't cre-
ative, but we were pretty good. Everybody found out in that Super Bowl."
Ryan stayed in New York for eight seasons before Bud Grant hired
him in 1976 to run the Minnesota Vikings' defense. The Vikings made
the Super Bowl in Ryan's first season with Grant but were beaten by
the Oakland Raiders 32-14 in a game that was never close. "We got
beat clean," says Ryan. When reminded that Hall of Fame wideout Fred
Biletnikoff had a good game against his defense, Ryan sniffs. "Shit, ev-
erybody had a good game."
Ryan spent just one more season in Minnesota before Neill Arm-
strong brought him to Chicago as defensive coordinator. "That," Ryan
says, "was the first time I was a true defensive coordinator." It was not
necessarily an enviable job. The proud Bears possessed eight NFL titles,
but none since 1963 and just one since 1946. They had gone 9-5 in the
previous year under Jack Pardee, and that had been the team's first win-
ning season in a decade. Ryan assessed his hand quickly. "When
I got
there," he says, "we didn't have many good players."
187

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
History will hold that Ryan was a genius—in that generous way the
noun is applied to coaches—both as a motivator and strategist. It will less
likely declare him a thoughtful, engaged, defensive scientist who loved
nothing more than to doodle formations on a chalkboard, an inveterate
tinkerer. But that indeed was Buddy Ryan. Some of those chalkboard
creations were modest, variants on the standard; others were outland-
ish. Many would never find their way into a game. But throughout his
career Ryan loved to play with schemes. In his early years with the
Bears, as the team struggled to build an identity with marginal players,
Buddy's blackboard got a workout. The team went 7-9 in 1978, Arm-
strong's, and Ryan's, first season, and were 4-5 through October of the
'79 season, preparing for a home game against Detroit, when Ryan drew
up the 46 during a defensive team meeting.
Doug Plank was then a fifth-year pro from Ohio State, an undersized hit
man (listed at 6 feet, 200 pounds, but smaller in reality) who, as starting
free safety, would throw his body recklessly around the field. (Plank would
later explain his style: "I had to play a certain way," he said in a 2009 in-
terview. "And once I started playing that way, I developed a reputation for
playing that way, and I had to protect that reputation." He admitted to often
experiencing foggy memory now.)
Plank sat in every one of Ryan's defensive meetings in 1978 and '79.
"In those years, and even beyond," says Plank, "Buddy was very creative.
Every week he would come up with some sort of new defense. He was al-
ways trying new things. Most of them didn't last very long. So this one day
he puts this defense up on the board where I move up from free safety to
middle linebacker, along with some other shifts and changes. We're get-
ting ready to leave the room, and one of the guys says, 'What are we going
to call this one?' Well, Buddy was always drawing up packages but never
drew them up with peoples' names or with X's and O's. He would always
just write numbers."
Ryan circled Plank's number 46 several times, over and over, and then
said, "We'll callit
c46."'
"Now, at this point," says Plank, "a marching band did not come into the
room and start playing music because of the invention of the 46 defense. At
that point none of us knew if the 46 was going to be around any longer than
some of the others, and that might be one game or one quarter or one snap.
188

THE RYAN FAMILY DEFENSE
But it turns out that the 46 worked a little better than some of the others."
Ryan says, "I was just trying to screw up teams' blocking schemes until
we got some better players. In '79, when I first started messing with the 46,
it wasn't really a scheme at all, it was just something we tried. We had to do
something. And it did mess up some of their blocking patterns. Then we got
better at it. And then we got real good at it when the players were better."
Sitting in the tack room of the horse barn in Kentucky, Ryan grabs a
writer's notebook and draws up the 46, narrating as he scribbles. Now he
writes X's and O's, not numbers—after all, he has no team, no jerseys. But
the task is so familiar that it takes just a few seconds. Like any good defen-
sive coach, the last thing he does is count the symbols, making sure there
are 11, which there are.
The 46 was a 4-3 defense, the base alignment Ryan liked best. But
it was much more than a 4-3. The 46 was the first defense in modern
football in which three interior linemen covered the center and two of-
fensive guards, forcing the offensive linemen to block one-on-one and
thus limiting their ability to move or help elsewhere. (Customarily, in a
4-3 defense, the center is uncovered and free to assist in double-team
blocks or picking up blitzers. In a 3-4 defense, the defensive ends are
usually lined up over the offensive tackles, leaving the guards uncovered.)
Those first three Bears linemen, in 1979, were Alan Page (who had spent
most of his career in Minnesota and would land in the Hall of Fame),
Jim Osborne and Dan Hampton. The fourth defensive lineman, effectively
the weakside defensive end, would line up outside the tackle assigned to
block him. Behind the front four Ryan moved two linebackers to the tight
end side and brought one safety—Plank—up as a fourth linebacker. That
was the 46. "Now they call it 'eight in the box,' " says Ryan.
The 46, even in its infancy, had two primary goals: One, stop the
run. Eight in the box (four linemen, three linebackers, one safety) will
do that. Two was to position the defense to bring more pressure on the
quarterback than the offense can block. As the scheme evolved, that
aspect would become more effective. "Eventually," says Bruce Coslet,
who coached against Ryan as defensive coordinator for Cincinnati
through the mid- and late-1980s, "the 46 became a fucking nightmare
to coach against. It was something nobody had seen and nobody knew
how to prepare for it. Buddy changed football with that defense."
189

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
On Nov. 4, 1979, the Bears beat Detroit, 35-7. They won five of the next
six games to finish the regular season with a 10-6 record; two days before
Christmas they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the play-
offs. A year later they slipped to 7-9 and in 1981 they went 6-10 after losing
10 of their first 13 games. Armstrong was finished, and the players knew it,
but the defense felt that Ryan was building something special. "We played
San Diego in 1981," says Fencik. "We had gotten off to a lousy start [the
Bears were 1-6], and they had Dan Fouts and Kellen Winslow. And we beat
them 20-17 at home, and the 46 was great that day. We had them confused,
and everything just clicked."
There was a bond forming, emotionally and schematically. "Neil Arm-
strong was a true gentleman," says Fencik. "But I really don't think he
appreciated how young we were. He had come from the Purple People
Eaters, and those guys were so mature." The Bears' defense began grow-
ing up with Ryan. In late December '81, Fencik and Page drafted a letter
to Halas, asking that Ryan be retained when Armstrong was inevitably
canned. "Alan and I wrote the letter, and to cover our asses we had the
whole defense sign it," says Fencik. "So George Halas shows up one day
while we're practicing indoors on concrete floors at the Great Lakes Na-
val Training Center because it's snowing like crazy outside. That was the
day he dismissed Neil Armstrong. He rides over to the defense in his golf
cart and points at us and says in this gruff, old voice, 'I got your letter.
Your coaches will be retained.' And that's how Mike Ditka wound up in-
heriting Buddy Ryan."
More important than Ryan's retention, even he would admit now, were
the additions made to the roster. Linebacker Otis Wilson was drafted in
1980 and middle linebacker Mike Singletary a year later. Defensive tackle
Steve McMichael was signed as a free agent before the '80 season. Pass
rush end Richard Dent would join in '83 and linebacker Wilber Marshall
in '84. Piece by piece the Bears got better. "It was a great scheme," says
Ryan. "People called me a genius back then. When you get great players,
you can be a genius."
The Bears who took the field in '85 were exquisitely suited to Ryan's
system. The inside three linemen—McMichael, Hampton and either Re-
frigerator Perry or Mike Hartenstine—had the brute strength to occupy
the inside of the offensive line and often put pressure on passers without
190

THE RYAN FAMILY DEFENSE
blitz help. Dent, an eighth-round draft pick who came into the NFL at 230
pounds, much too small for a defensive end, grew to 260 and became an
edge-rushing force. The clogged middle forced teams to try to run out-
side, where regular linebackers Marshall, Singletary and Wilson were fast
enough to pursue. Plank, who retired following the 1982 season after suf-
fering a spinal concussion, was replaced first by Todd Bell, and then by
Dave Duerson. "The whole thing started with covering the center and both
guards," says Ryan. "Nobody had really ever done it before. It was hard to
run against it. And with the guys we had in the middle, and Richard Dent, it
was hard to pass against it too. Not to sound arrogant, but for a while there
nobody really gave us any problems."
The great potential weakness of the 46 is that cornerbacks can often be
left in one-on-one coverage. Ryan's hope was always that the quarterback
wouldn't have time to exploit it. Or wouldn't be able to recognize quickly
enough how to exploit it. Despite its reputation as a scheme of relentless,
one-dimensional pressure, the 46
is, in fact, a complex combination of
fronts and blitzes. "The scheme forced people to make quick decisions,"
says Fencik. "And some teams just couldn't adjust. Buddy set up this system
within the 46 where we would audible fronts and coverage based on what
the offense showed. It required a lot of coordination. But very few offenses
were prepared to audible two times, and once we would show something
and then audible, well, it just made you very confident that you would rarely
be in a bad position." As an added benefit, the multiple fronts forced teams
to eat up practice time preparing for the Bears' 46, limiting their ability to
game-plan a diverse offense.
On a much
different
level, Ryan connected emotionally with his
players. This facet is often now muddied by episodes that would taint
Ryan's legacy later in his career. In 1989 as coach of the Eagles, Ryan
was accused by the Dallas Cowboys of putting "bounties" on kicker Luis
Zendejas and quarterback Troy Aikman, promising rewards to players
who could knock either man out of the game, charges Ryan has always
denied. Four years later, as defensive coordinator of the Houston Oilers,
he was captured on national television slugging offensive coordinator
Kevin Gilbride after criticizing Gilbride's run-and-shoot offense, which
Ryan felt left his defensive players on the field too often and too long.
But in 1985 Ryan's fire burned all to the good. He was rough on some
191

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
players. "I hated him," Singletary told The New York Times in '85. "He
was always picking on me. When I first came into camp, he referred to
me as 'the little, short, fat guy' and always 'Number 50.' He never called
me by my name." (Gary Fencik,
it seems, takes
it a
little differently:
"When
I see Buddy to this day, or call him up, he calls me '45.' And I
would be offended if he called me anything else.") But Fencik does recall
the treatment of Singletary. "The first training camp," he says, "Mike
Singletary couldn't finish the 10-minute run, and Buddy was merciless
with him for a long time after that. Buddy was a sergeant in the Korean
War. You had to earn his respect."
And most players wanted to earn that respect. "Buddy was a one-of-a-
kind individual," Fencik continues. "You did not want to fail him. There
were times when I was playing for Buddy, and out on the field if some-
thing was going wrong, all I could think was that I didn't want to disap-
point my coach or my teammates. How is this going to look when they
play the game film on Monday?
It became a very emotional situation.
Buddy created a unit mentality. We're all in this together. And this was a
very big part of the success of the Bears' defense in that era. When you
combine that with the encyclopedia of defenses that our opponents had
to prepare for, it just set us up very well."
Ryan routinely allowed his players to tweak his defensive schemes. Fen-
cik, the defensive captain, would approach Ryan on the sideline with a mes-
sage from Marshall or Dent asking for freedom to run a certain stunt. Ryan
would grumble, "Who's running this defense, anyway?" but then he would
grant permission with the caveat that if something didn't work, it would be
shelved for the rest of the day.
The Bears' defense was brilliant in 1984, leading the NFL in overall de-
fense, rushing defense and sacks. By the time '85 arrived, Chicago often had
teams beat before the first snap.
"Say a team had first-and-10," recalls Fencik. "They know they can't
run the ball, so they call a pass play and go to max protect, keeping both
backs in and helping with a tight end. But we're not blitzing at this point;
we rush four and drop seven, and they're looking at throwing into that
with two receivers. No chance. So it's second-and-10. Now it comes down
to tendencies, and maybe we blitz and get them in third-and-long, and
then all the advantage goes to Buddy.
192

THE RYAN FAMILY DEFENSE
"We had one series where we would blitz inside our own 20-yard line,"
says Fencik. "But then teams would recognize that and start calling an au-
dible if we looked like we were showing blitz, and we would back off and
double both wideouts. It was just a period in time where not only did we
have superior talent, but we had a superior system."
Ryan took the 46 to Philadelphia and went 43-38-1 in five seasons
before he was fired. He would have less success in Arizona, where he
was head coach of the Cardinals for two seasons. As with all innova-
tions, Ryan's 46 forced adaptation on the league. Passing offense grew
more sophisticated, finding ways to put more pressure on the vulner-
able cornerbacks and the single high free safety. Yet defensive coaches
continued to rely on creative pressure packages to disrupt timed pass
routes, none more than one Rex Ryan in Baltimore. "I'm not the only
one," he said in the fall of 2008. "Every time you see some team mov-
ing people around to get pressure, you should think of my father. He
influenced every one of them."

AS COACH of the New York Jets, Rex Ryan has a huge office, but he
fills it nonetheless. He fills it with a big body: tree-trunk legs stretching
massive mesh shorts and a gargantuan torso draped in a green Jets golf
shirt. But more than with his bulk, he fills the room with his personality,
a self-confidence that borders on bravado, driven by a sense of having
been denied too long. There is a good deal of Buddy in Rex, and Rex
likes to hear that. "Dad was a hell of a football coach," says Rex. "He
knew what he was doing."
Buddy was a hell of a football coach in Buffalo, traveling on a recruit-
ing trip in December of 1962 when his wife, Doris, gave birth to twin
boys back in Oklahoma. The news of their birth reached Buddy slowly.
"He found out about it the next day," says Doris. "Or maybe it was two
days." Rex and Rob the twins were named. They had an older brother,
Jim. All three were in the stadium in Miami for Super Bowl
III and
again in New Orleans for Super Bowl XX. Rex and Rob would become
coaches. (Jim is a lawyer.) The family now has a combined five Super
193

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Bowl rings: Buddy's two with the Jets and Bears, Rob's two while work-
ing as a defensive assistant under Bill Belichick with the Patriots and
Rex's with the 2000 Ravens.
Should anyone doubt the Ryan boys' bona fides as football coaches, con-
sider this: Both Rex and Rob played football as fourth-graders living in Toron-
to but were thrown off the team for hitting a player too hard. Doris marched
onto the field and said, "This is a contact sport where I come from."
Banned from football, the Ryan boys played baseball and hockey.
(Rex was an all-star goalie.) In the fall of 1977 Doris sent the boys, then
14 years old, to live with Buddy, who was beginning his second season
under Bud Grant with the Vikings. "It was time for them to be with
their father," says Doris (by then, she and Buddy were divorced). They
lived with Buddy and Joanie for a year in Minnesota and four years
in Chicago. Rex and Rob were ball boys for the Bears. Walter Payton
was their best friend. They soaked up football every day. Buddy knew
firsthand what coaching could do to a man's personal life, and as Rex
and Rob moved on through college, he tried to steer them away from it.
But they persisted, and in the spring of '87, while he was coach of the
Eagles, Buddy traveled to Oklahoma, rented a hotel conference room
and taught his sons the 46 on a paper easel with a black marker. And
they gave as good as they got. "They knew plenty," says Buddy. "So
I
told 'em to go get some jobs."
Rex went from Eastern Kentucky to New Mexico Highlands to More-
head State—"the big time," he says—before joining his dad and brother on
the staff of the Arizona Cardinals in the fall of 1994. Both were defensive
assistants. "Best ones
I had," says Buddy. "People said
it was nepotism.
Bulllllbhitr The Cardinals went 8-8 in the Ryans' first year and ranked
No. 3 in the NFL in defense but slipped to 4-12 and last in scoring defense
in '95. That got Buddy fired.
Rex didn't get a single job offer from an NFL team. So he took a
job as the defensive coordinator at the University of Cincinnati under
coach Rick Minter. I'm gonna punish people now, Ryan thought to
himself. I'm going back to the college game, and I'm gonna punish
people. Early in two-a-days
in the summer of 1996, Minter called for
a nine-on-seven inside running game drill, in which the two defensive
safeties are on the field essentially as props and not intended to tackle
194

THE RYAN FAMILY DEFENSE
or be blocked. "On the first rep Rex calls for a free safety blitz up the
A gap," says Minter. "He just stones the running back. I say, 'Rex, my
gosh, it's a nine-on-seven drill.' Rex says, 'Coach, we've got to set the
tone around here.' "
Rex coached for two years at Cincinnati, where he built a defense that
was indeed punishing. In '98 he spent a year as defensive line coach at
Oklahoma, and then, in '99, Brian Billick hired him as a defensive assistant
with the Ravens, bringing him back into the NFL. He immediately con-
nected with players. "Coaches are mostly pains in the ass," says Rob Bur-
nett, who was a nine-year veteran defensive tackle when Ryan came to the
Ravens in '99. "Rex has a humanity to him that most coaches don't have.
It's rare for guys to want to win for their coach in this league. But we would
have jumped on a grenade for that guy."
In 2002 defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis left the Ravens, and Bil-
lick promoted Mike Nolan to defensive coordinator. "I was pissed because,
basically I got fucked," says Rex. "Brian never knew me. Maybe I never fit
his image. But it was a crock of shit." (Billick's take: "When Marvin left, I
had Mike Nolan on my staff, and I felt we needed a more veteran presence.
But I knew Rex had coordinator capabilities. You don't spend five minutes
around Rex Ryan and not see his passion.")
Three more years under Nolan. Three more years waiting for a chance.
Finally, when Nolan left to become head coach of the 49ers in 2005, Ryan
was promoted to defensive coordinator. For four years he would be a key
figure in accelerating the defensive evolution in the NFL.
For starters Rex installed the Ryan family attitude, which, at its core,
meant the intimidation of opponents, achieved primarily by hitting and
hitting hard, right up to the edge of what the rules allow (and sometimes
beyond). "It starts with a common mind-set," says Plank. "And without
that mind-set, the playbook the Ryan family has used for 30 years is ir-
relevant." Then Rex went to work on his schemes.
Dick LeBeau and Dom Capers had changed the pressure paradigm
with the zone blitz (Chapter 18). Rex used many of their ideas, mixed
with two cornerstone principles. One: Stop the run. "Say what you want
about me," says Ryan, "but if I want to, I'll stop your run." Two: Knock
the quarterback on his back, for the simple reason best expressed by
Rob Ryan (who in 2009 was Eric Mangini's defensive coordinator with
195

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
the Browns). "The more you hit the quarterback," Rob says, "the better
you're going to do."
LeBeau's zone scheme
is characterized by unpredictability within a
fairly static 3-4 formation. Rex took the next step, dramatically altering
the placement of players on the field. It became common to see the Ra-
vens line up with only one player in a three-point stance and five or six
other linemen and linebackers strolling around in the tackle box, waiting
for the offense to call an audible before deciding where to attack from,
or whether to attack at
all. While his base alignment is a 3-4, Ryan's
willingness to move players around to anywhere on the field freed him to
conceive almost limitless schemes.
Jim Fassell, who has coached both with and against Ryan, says,
"Rex started doing things that nobody had ever done before. He would
start out with seven or eight guys in the box, and then walk five of
them out of the box right before the snap. He really caused a lot of
consternation to offenses."
"Rex has an immense defensive package," says former Oakland and
Tampa Bay head coach Jon Gruden. "I've seen him do almost everything
imaginable. He was one of the first guys to major in what I call 'designer
blitzes,' which are blitzes that are dialed up just for a particular game or
a particular situation."
Ryan's defenses clearly dovetailed neatly with the changing profile
of the modern athlete. No longer is a professional defense made up of
cookie-cutter positional players. Defensive ends are faster than some
running backs. Linebackers are stronger than some offensive tackles.
Safeties are capable of rushing the passer from 10 yards off the line of
scrimmage, bringing speed and power to the blitz from the deep third of
the field. "Look at the collection of athletes we had in Baltimore," says
Adalius Thomas, who played under Ryan with the Ravens. "There were
a bunch of versatile guys out there, and some of them are going to the
Hall of Fame." Since all 11 of Ryan's defenders were capable of blitzing,
he disguised his pressures by making it seem as if they might all blitz.
Thomas was among the most versatile. At
6' 2", 270 pounds, he
played every position on the defense except cornerback. There were
other transcendent athletes: safety Ed Reed, linebackers Ray Lewis and
Terrell Suggs and interior space- eaters Tony Siragusa and Haloti Ngata.

THE RYAN FAMILY DEFENSE
The 2006 Ravens led the NFL by allowing an average of just 12.1 points
per game and held Peyton Manning's Indianapolis Colts to just five field
goals in a 15-6 playoff loss.
Rex Ryan's defense has no name to put alongside his father's 46, but it
is invoked in every NFL game on every weekend. Scrambling, amorphous
defensive looks have become common. Hybrid players have become stan-
dard. The blitzing of quarterbacks has never been more at a premium. That
is the influence of Rex Ryan's unnamed defense, a link in the chain between
his father and the future.

4-3 ZONE DOG
Asfirst conceived, at least inpart, by BillArnsparger in Miami with the
early 70s Dolphins and later brought tofullforce by the Pittsburgh Steelers
defenses ofthe 90s, the zone blitz is designed to leave an offense uncertain
as to wherepressure on the quarterback might be comingfrom and to
provide disguisedzonepass coverage in those areas that would typically
be left vacant by blitzers. On thisplay,from a 4-3 set, a linebacker blitzes
from the right defensive edge. The middle linebacker also blitzes, along with
the strong safety. But the defensive enddrops back into the short curlzone,
taking away the most obvious "hot read"from the quarterback.

THE ZONE
BLITZ
In 1983 Dick LeBeau and the Cincinnati Bengals hit
on a defensive ploy that really worked. It still does
shaped linebacker intercepted a pass on the final snap of the first half and
returned it 100 yards for a touchdown. The play was a bizarre sight, as
the Steelers' James Harrison staggered the final 10 yards into the end zone
where he collapsed and lay exhausted from the effort of lugging his dense,
powerful body the entire length of the field, a body clearly not designed
for such work. But it was the beginning, not the end, of this long, operatic
play that fits more significantly into football history.
The situation: With just over two minutes remaining in the first half
of Super Bowl XLIII at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, with the
favored Steelers leading the Arizona Cardinals 10-7, Cards linebacker
Karlos Dansby intercepted a Ben Roethlisberger pass and returned it to
the Steelers' 34. In seven plays Arizona quarterback Kurt Warner moved
the Cards to a first-and-goal at the Steelers' one-yard line with 18 seconds
to play. It seemed a virtual certainty that the Cardinals would go into the
halftime dressing room with a lead.
On first down the Cardinals lined up with Pro Bowl receivers Larry
Fitzgerald and Anquan Boldin (who between them had caught passes

for 42 touchdowns over the 2007 and '08 regular seasons), both to the
left side of the formation, both split, with Boldin outside Fitzgerald. The
Steelers had six men on the line of scrimmage—four standing and only
two with a hand on the ground; but just before the snap three other
defenders moved up close, into gaps, as if preparing for an all-out blitz.
At the snap, from a stand-up right defensive end position, Harrison took
a step forward.
In fact, Harrison was baiting Warner, giving the impression that he
was blitzing, when he was actually planning to drop off into the middle of
the field in a form of zone pass defense. The tactic is called a "zone blitz,"
a catchall phrase for any defense that blitzes from one area while drop-
ping players—linemen, linebackers or defensive backs—into zone cover-
age in another area. These defenses are also called "zone dogs" (as in "red
dogs," an old school name for blitzes) or "fire zones."
Kurt Warner, of course, knew all about them, and he knew that the
Steelers and 71-year-old defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau loved them.
"Pittsburgh lives off zone dogs," Warner had said in the spring before that
season. "You see zone dogs everywhere, but Pittsburgh is so athletic and
so skilled, they've really made
it a part of their package. Against them,
you're going to see it four, six, eight times a game. Against a lot of other
teams, you might see it once."
In nearly 30 minutes of the Super Bowl the Steelers had not yet used
a zone blitz. Warner took the snap, and the Steelers brought five rush-
ers, not nine. But Warner was already convinced that he was going to
be pressured heavily—he expected Harrison to rush—and needed to
unload quickly. To Warner's
left, Fitzgerald slipped outside and set a
pick on Steelers' corner Deshea Townsend, allowing Boldin to cut in-
side, where he looked momentarily free at the goal line. "Your instinct
in those situations is to throw hot," Warner had said earlier, meaning to
throw quickly to a receiver in an area theoretically vacated by a blitzer.
Following this instinct, Warner looked for Boldin running into the area
from which Harrison had blitzed.
Except Harrison hadn't blitzed. He had turned his hips to the outside
and rotated out of the box and into the curl-slant area. "I never saw him,"
Warner would say after the game. He delivered the ball toward Boldin.
but instead it hit Harrison directly in the hands, and 15 painful seconds

THE ZONE BLITZ
later, the Steelers had a 16-7 lead and Harrison had made what LeBeau
later called "the greatest play in Super Bowl history." (The Steelers would
need another great play— a toe-tapping catch by Santonio Holmes in the
back corner of the end zone with just 35 seconds to play in the game—to
secure a 27-23 victory and their record sixth Super Bowl championship.)
LeBeau, more than anyone, could appreciate Harrison's zone dog. The
seeds of that play had been planted more than quarter-century earlier,
when LeBeau embarked on a professional odyssey that would lead to a
reinvention of defensive football.
March 2008
A PHONE rings, and the writer answers. A voice on the other end says,
"This is Coach LeBeau. You want to talk about the zone blitz?" It was hard
to tell if there was a question mark at the end of the sentence. Maybe his
words were a statement rather than a query, but the topic on the table
was, indeed, the zone blitz. A request had been made through the Steel-
ers' media-relations department. There had been e-mails and phone calls.
All declined. LeBeau didn't want to talk about himself. Finally, there had
been a letter—old school—sent to LeBeau's office. It was the letter that
prompted the phone call.
"I felt like I should get back to you," says LeBeau. "The problem is, I
want to write my own book someday, and I'm afraid
I won't have anec-
dotes left." That was amusing, and a litde poignant too. If anybody has
a football book in him, no matter how many stories he's already told, it's
Dick LeBeau.
He continued, "Plimpton took all my good anecdotes." Of course he
had. George Plimpton, the iconic journalist-author, essentially invented
the genre of participatory sports journalism with Paper Lion, published
in 1965. It was a brilliant, funny, self-deprecating account of Plimpton's
experience as a "quarterback" at the Detroit Lions' '63 training camp.
More than the personal
recollection of an erudite, Harvard-educated
writer, Paper Lion drew back the curtain on the world of the professional
football player. While far less scandalous than Jim Bouton's Ball Four, the
bawdy baseball memoir published in '70,
it was every bit as insightful.
When Plimpton arrived
at the Lions' camp in 1963, LeBeau was
201

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
already established as one of the best defensive backs in the NFL, a
6' 1", 185-pound starting right cornerback (a position he would hold
for 171 consecutive games, from '59 to '71). He was a part of a Lions
team that had gone 11-3 the previous year and finished second to Vince
Lombardi's Packers in the Western Conference of the premerger NFL.
LeBeau was also part of a truly outstanding defense that included fu-
ture Pro Football Hall of Famers Joe Schmidt at linebacker, Dick (Night
Train) Lane at cornerback and Yale Lary at safety, along with multi-
time Pro Bowlers Alex Karras and Roger Brown (tackles), Wayne Walker
(linebacker) and LeBeau himself.
LeBeau had come to Detroit from London, Ohio, by way of the Ohio
State Buckeyes, where he started on Woody Hayes's 1957 national cham-
pionship team. He was also just a little different from the average profes-
sional football player, as Plimpton observed in Paper Lion:
LeBeau was from Ohio, with a pronounced midwestern twang, nasal
and slow, which made the songs he put to his guitar quite incompre-
hensible, though fetching: gentle songs full of melancholy and pov-
erty, one supposed, and love unrequited. He himself had a lady-killer
reputation. Thin-hipped, built like a high school basketball player, his
hair worn longer than most of the others', he was called Ricky, less a
diminutive of Richard than derived from a crop of teenage movie stars
and singers of the time, all of that name, whose manner and attitude
he seemed to cultivate.
LEBEAU WAS different on the field too. He played at the opposite corner
from Lane, one of the greatest and most instinctive defensive backs in the
history of the game, whose 14 interceptions in his rookie year of 1952 as
a member of the Los Angeles Rams still stands as an NFL single-season
record (what is more remarkable is that Lane did it in 12 games). LeBeau,
meanwhile, was more of a thinker, analyzing offenses and offensive play-
ers long before he began coaching against them. Plimpton described
interviewing Lane about LeBeau's propensity for reading the strides of
long-legged receivers and quoted Lane's response: "Well, that's Dickie-
Bird for you. He's complex. He confirms and thinks on it about reading
the receivers."
202

THE ZONE BLITZ
THAT REPUTATION for cerebral play was validated in LeBeau's first year
of retirement, when Mike McCormack, head coach of the Eagles, hired
LeBeau, 36, to coach special teams. He spent three years in that role be-
fore moving to Green Bay in 1976 under Bart Starr to coach defensive
backs and then to Cincinnati under Forrest Gregg in '80 in the same ca-
pacity. The Bengals of the early '80s were a premier franchise, losing in
the Super Bowl at the end of the '81 season to the 49ers 26-21 and then
winning seven more games in the strike-abbreviated '82 season.
But LeBeau saw change coming. Here, a brief bit of history is in or-
der. Throughout most of the 20th century, pass defense was man-to-man,
with occasional double coverage. Zone defenses became prominent in the
1950s; Bill Walsh's short-passing, possession-based West Coast offense,
born in '70 and cultivated through the ensuing decade, was the first air
attack to exploit the moving voids and seams in the zone defense.
It was
also one of the
first offenses to use "hot reads,"
in which
quarterbacks—like Kurt Warner a quarter century later—were condi-
tioned to throw quickly to preassigned receivers when the defense blitzed
or to exploit man-to-man single coverage. "The one thing you knew," says
Steve Spurrier, who played quarterback in the NFL from 1967 through
'76, "was that if you saw a blitz, you were getting man-to-man defense
behind it. That didn't mean it was easy to deal with the blitz, but at least
you knew what coverage you were going to get."
By the time Walsh's 49ers beat the Bengals in that Super Bowl at the
end of the '81 season,
it was obvious to football insiders that defenses
would have to somehow adapt to match the Walsh offense—and quickly,
or the blitz would be neutered.
LeBeau believed in pressure. It was in his DNA. (One of LeBeau's good
friends, basketball coach Bob Knight, was a pal from their days at Ohio
State. They often talked about ball pressure in their respective sports.)
Says LeBeau, "When I was with the Lions, we ran an 11-up blitz, all 11
guys on the line of scrimmage. Wayne Walker was one of the best blitzers
I've ever seen." But by the time he reached Cincinnati, LeBeau could see
the new challenge. "At that point, around 1982 or '83, we were really look-
ing for a way to get to the quarterback," he recalls. "But with some of the
offenses that were being developed at that time, the quarterbacks were
getting pretty good at throwing quickly when you blitzed."
203

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
LeBeau had already begun tinkering with new ways to attack the
quarterback. He had all the support he needed from defensive coordi-
nator Hank Bullough, a 3-4 defense pioneer who had fiddled around
with elements of the zone blitz when he was with the Patriots from 1973
through '79. In '78 Bullough had used Mike Hawkins, a versatile 6' 2",
232-pound rookie linebacker, as the focal point of several zone blitz-
type schemes. He was more than happy to let LeBeau try to work up
some new schemes.
Before the 1983 season, LeBeau put in a coverage package in which
the Bengals would show blitz, encouraging the quarterback to read man-
to-man in the secondary. But instead of manning up his corners on the
outside in straight one-on-one coverage, LeBeau had 14-year veteran
corner Ken Riley "sit down" (hold his ground) and rotated a safety into
zone coverage behind him. Before long, this would become a standard
coverage, but at the time it was highly unusual. As soon as a quarterback
read blitz, his assumption would be that Riley would be backpedaling
to avoid getting beat deep, prompting the QB to throw quick and short,
into Riley's short zone.
LeBeau happily recalls that first experimental zone blitz. "So there was
this exhibition game and we just decided to try it. We ran the zone blitz and
the quarterback just threw the ball straight to Ken Riley," he says at a Steel-
ers training camp practice in the summer of 2009. "And I thought, hey, we
might have something here." He smiles broadly. "Turns out we did."
LeBeau continued to play with the scheme throughout the Bengals'
7-9 season in '83. In the off-season, Forrest Gregg left the Bengals to be-
come head coach at Green Bay and took Bullough with him. New Bengals
head coach Sam Wyche gave LeBeau his first shot as defensive coordina-
tor, and LeBeau made the zone blitz his top priority. First stop: Baton
Rouge, where longtime NFL defensive guru Bill Arnsparger, 57, had taken
the head coaching job at LSU.
LeBeau picks up the story. "I got off the airplane, drove straight over to
Bill's office, walked in and started asking questions. I knew he had done
some stuff in the past that was similar to what I thinking about."
And he was correct. Arnsparger, raised in Paris, Ky., had played his col-
lege football at Miami (Ohio), long known as a "coaching cradle" for the
many coaches who were nurtured there; he took his first job at Ohio State,
204

THE ZONE BLITZ
leaving two years before LeBeau arrived there in the fall of 1955. And
now, almost 30 years later, LeBeau had come to LSU seeking Arnspar-
ger's
advice. "I remember the day Dick visited me like it was yesterday,"
says Arnsparger. "We were two guys talking football on a beautiful day in
Baton Rouge. What could be better than that?"
Arnsparger's coaching history made him a perfect resource for LeBeau.
While working at Kentucky from 1954 through '61, one ofArnsparger's col-
leagues had been Don Shula, who would become coach of the Baltimore
Colts in '63. A year later, Shula hired Arnsparger as his defensive-line
coach, and in '70, when Shula took over the Miami Dolphins, he took
Arnsparger with him.
In '71, Arnsparger began using Dolphins linebacker Bob Matheson, a
6' 4" 238-pounder, as a defensive end who would sometimes drop off into
pass coverage. The scheme left the Dolphins in a de facto 3-4 defense and
also enabled them to zone-blitz by rushing the likes of Nick Buoniconti
and Doug Swift from one side, along with three down linemen, while
dropping Matheson into coverage.
"With Bob there, with linebacking skills," says Arnsparger, "we were
able to rush five guys and cover with six. That's what you need to run a
zone blitz. We could usually drop a linebacker into that slot zone, and
that gave people a lot of problems." Arnsparger became progressively
more creative, at times running double blitzes from the outside and
dropping tackle Manny Fernandez, a brilliant athlete, into coverage. A
year later the Dolphins went 17-0, winning the Super Bowl, and the fol-
lowing season won another.
Arnsparger wasn't finished. After spending three years as coach of the
New York Giants from 1974 to '76, he went back to Miami for another eight
years and built another solid Dolphins defense, known as the Killer B's for
employing as many as seven starters whose last name began with B. Those
Dolphins played in two more Super Bowls, though they lost both.
What had drawn LeBeau to Louisiana was the chance to tap Arnspar-
ger's thinking behind the zone blitz. Two words stayed in his head. "Bill's
catchphrase was that he wanted to get 'safe pressure,' on the quarterback,"
says LeBeau. "And that expression stuck with me because that was a very
succinct way to summarize exactly what I was looking for. Safe pressure.
I walked out the door saying those words to myself."
205

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
When he got back to Cincinnati, LeBeau made the zone blitz central
to the Bengals' defensive philosophy. But it wasn't until 1986 that it tru-
ly took off, and it happened when the Bengals drafted 6' 3", 228-pound
safety David Fulcher out of Arizona State.
"David Fulcher was a unique athlete," says LeBeau. "Very big for his
position, but also very talented. Blitzing with him was one of the ways
we expanded the possibilities of the fire zone, and it was very effective."
In a play that LeBeau called Fulcher Two Stay, he had Fulcher, at strong
safety, jump into the scrimmage box and blitz while the free safety slid
into a two deep zone with a cornerback, and at least two other lineback-
ers dropped off in coverage. In effect, Fulcher was a fifth linebacker in
the Bengals' 3-4 scheme.
In 1988, Fulcher's third season and LeBeau's fifth as coordinator, the
Bengals went back to the Super Bowl and again battled Walsh's 49ers to
the final possession before losing 20-16.
By then, in the course of eight seasons, the offense-defense paradigm
had been reversed; now it was offenses that needed to adapt, to counter the
effectiveness of LeBeau's zone. "I always felt that we contributed greatly to
the development of the run-and-shoot offense," says LeBeau. "Teams were
just looking for quicker and quicker ways to attack, to the point where it
might not even matter where the pressure was coming from. We showed
teams the holes in their protection with what we were doing."
IN THE decade following the success of that Bengals' defense, other
teams around the NFL, of course, began to install pieces of the zone
blitz, including the New Orleans Saints of the late '80s. One of the Saints'
defensive assistants in 1986 was 36-year-old Dom Capers. Like LeBeau,
Capers was an Ohioan to his marrow: born in Cambridge, Ohio, grew
up in Buffalo, Ohio, and played safety and linebacker at Mount Union
in the state. (His roommate there was Larry Kehres, who would later
become the coach at their alma mater and lead it to 10 national cham-
pionships through 2008.)
Capers had coached 12 years at seven colleges before he joined head
coach Jim Mora in 1984 as a defensive assistant with the Philadelphia
Stars (who the next season became the Baltimore Stars) of the soon-to-
be-defunct United States Football League. Mora left after two seasons and
206

THE ZONE BLITZ
in '86 took Capers with him to New Orleans. Capers had experimented
with elements of zone blitz schemes in the USFL, but in New Orleans, he
discovered, the schemes themselves were often less critical—because the
talent itself was so outstanding.
"During the time we were there," says Capers, "we had some of the
best front-seven players in the NFL. Look at our linebackers: Pat Swill-
ing and Rickey Jackson on the outside, Sam Mills and Vaughan Johnson
inside. Two of our up-front pass rushers were Frank Warren and Jumpy
Geathers. With those guys we could beat people one-on-one, and we did.
We didn't have to get real creative."
Those Saints went to the playoffs after the '87, '90 and '91 seasons and
averaged just under 10 wins a year from '86 to '91. In '92, Kansas City
Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher was brought to Pittsburgh as
head coach, and Cowher hired Capers as his defensive coordinator and
then brought in none other than Dick LeBeau to coach his secondary,
after LeBeau had been ousted in Cincinnati with head coach Wyche.
The two Buckeyes, Capers and LeBeau, put their heads and their
experience together. "Dick had done more zone blitzing than
I had,"
recalls Capers. "But I had done some too. We started talking, and it was
really pretty exciting."
Less exciting was the Steelers' personnel. Pittsburgh had gone 7-9 the
previous year. "Our pass rushers were not nearly as good as what we had
in New Orleans," says Capers. "Three quarters of the way through that
first season, we only had 19 sacks. We just weren't getting to the quarter-
back enough. It reached the point, late in that season, where Dick and I
just said to each other, 'We've got to do something X's and O's-wise be-
cause our front seven guys are just not beating people one-on-one.'
"If you looked at our secondary," Capers continues, "we had some
pretty good guys back there—Rod Woodson, Carnell Lake. So in the lat-
ter part of the season we started mixing in some zone pressures and get-
ting more pressure on the quarterback. The secondary responded well,
and the guys up front loved it because it was aggressive." The Steelers
improved so significantly down the stretch that year, en route to an 11-5
record, that they finished No. 2 in the league in scoring defense.
In the off-season Capers and LeBeau committed totally to the zone
blitz, hence giving birth to the nickname Blitz-burgh Steelers. The Steel-
207

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
ers also added outside linebacker Kevin Greene and inside linebacker
Chad Brown, upgrading their front seven.
Says Capers, "That second year we ended up doing a lot of zone pressur-
ing. We started doing things like having a lineman step forward to occupy a
blocker and then dropping back into coverage. And we found that offenses
started to play us differently. Their linemen couldn't be as aggressive be-
cause they just didn't know if our guys were coming. So much of football is
mental, and if you can make an offensive line passive, that's half the battle.
Then
if you can confuse them by dropping guys out into pass coverage
when they think they're going to pass-rush, that's another big part of it."
Those seasons in the early '90s established the Steelers' defensive rep-
utation that has lived on for nearly two decades. As a team the Steelers
ascended through the postseason, from a playoff loss in the '93 season to
a conference championship loss to the Chargers in '94 to a Super Bowl
loss to the Cowboys ending the '95 season. "We jumped off the diving
board with the zone blitz in Pittsburgh," says LeBeau. "And it turns out
we could swim pretty well."
Capers moved on in 1995 when he was named head coach of the ex-
pansion Carolina Panthers. There he built his defense around veterans
with experience in the zone blitz package. He brought in 36-year-old line-
backer Sam Mills from New Orleans and, in his second season, Kevin
Greene, then 34 years old, from Pittsburgh.
Success came quickly. The Panthers went 12-4 in '96, finishing second
in the NFL in scoring defense and reaching the NFC Championship Game,
where they ran into Brett Favre's Green Bay Packers and lost 30-13. The
zone blitz had propelled them deeper into the postseason than any previ-
ous expansion team in the league's history.
"The newness of the scheme was what really made it fun in those years,
with Pittsburgh and Carolina," says Capers. "Teams weren't ready for it.
There were very good teams that had a lot of trouble with it. Miami had
real problems, because Dan Marino had become so accustomed to mak-
ing man-to-man reads that the fire zones really seemed to confuse him."
LeBeau recalls talking to Marino after a game and asking him what reads
he was making: "He said, 'I had no idea what I was reading.' "
Capers is a coach's coach, with 15 stops in his 38-year career—so far.
His latest stop is Green Bay, where he became defensive coordinator in
208

THE ZONE BLITZ
2009. The zone blitz also rewarded LeBeau with a head coaching job,
back with the Bengals in 2000. It didn't go well. Under LeBeau, the Ben-
gals went 12-33 in three seasons. He was fired and spent a year in Buffalo
before returning to Pittsburgh in 2004 as defensive coordinator, and there
he has remained.
The Steelers have since won two Super Bowls and only once finished out
of the NFL's top five teams in total defense. Eighteen years after first arriv-
ing in Pittsburgh, LeBeau is considered something of an icon as a defensive
strategist. (He's also much loved by his players, to whom he recites The
Night Before Christmas, from memory, every year in the locker room.)
Yet he remains too humble to talk freely about himself, and is fully
humbled by success. "Everybody does it now," he says of his zone blitz.
"And really, it's a joy to see how popular it is. Anybody who was around
those teams in Cincinnati would feel the same way. And you'll never hear
me say I was the first guy to do it. All I can say is that at the time, it was
a pretty good idea."
It remains a pretty good idea, a staple of the game, undiminished by
time or opposition.

THE TCU 4-2-5
The TCUHorned Frogs, once among the nationsfootball elite in the
'30s and 40s under the reveredDutch Meyer, have returned to the
upper ranks over thepast decade largely on the strength ofcoach Gary
Pattersons 4-2-5 defense. The scheme uses the extra defensive speed
gained by replacing a linebacker with afifth back. The quintessential
fifth back is a strong safety-type who can be as effective in run support
as in pass defense, giving the defense, in effect, two strong safeties that
can attackforward or drop back, providing better andfaster overall
pursuit— critical in the modern game. At TCU, it is more than an
occasional scheme; it is run on every defensive snap.

Joe Lee Dunn uses a 3-3-5 defense, Gary Patterson uses a
4-2-5, both for the same reason: dread of the spread
toriously generous lot, these coaches, and spring is their giving season,
as they freely open their playbooks and film rooms to others who might
line up against them in future years, all in the name of collegial courtesy.
But when 44-year-old Joe Lee Dunn boarded a plane from Memphis to
Los Angeles in the spring of 1991, his motivations were entirely differ-
ent. He was scouting for the coming fall, and he was scared to death.
Dunn was beginning his third season at Memphis State under head
coach Chuck Stobart, and the upcoming season's schedule included an
opening game against Southern Cal on Labor Day afternoon in the storied
L.A. Coliseum. It would be the first—and to this day the only—meeting
between these two schools, one a foot soldier in the weekly college foot-
ball wars, the other a titan.
Any national attention was focused on the fact that Memphis State was
taking the matchup—or mis-matchup—largely for the $300,000 guarantee
that USC was paying the Tigers for making the trip. But Dunn, the defen-
sive coordinator, only wanted to know one thing: What the hell was his
undermanned defense getting into? So he visited USC's spring workouts.

to use the

to their peers. They are a no-

The team he saw on the practice field was not the USC of O.J. Simp-
son, Charles White and Marcus Allen. Nor was
it Pete Carroll's USC,
which would take off more than a decade later. Larry Smith was pre-
paring for his fifth season as coach of the Trojans. He had relieved Ted
Tollner, who won 26 games in four seasons—not good enough on the
heels of the John McKay-John Robinson dynasties that had produced
five national championships from 1962 through '78.
Smith had, so far, been better. His Trojans won 27 games in his first
three seasons and went to three consecutive Rose Bowls. In 1990 they
finished 8-4-1, including a loss to Michigan State in the John Han-
cock Bowl in the last game of the turbulent, two-year Todd Marinovich
quarterback era.
That loss, and that season, were a harbinger of struggles ahead. But
that mattered little to Dunn, who was accustomed to watching his play-
ers at Memphis State; to his eye, there was
still plenty of talent out
on that field in Los Angeles. "I was there for a few days," says Dunn,
"and I saw those USC guys walking around, up close. They were even
scarier that way than they were on film. Big, good-lookin' guys and all
that. Mighty impressive.
I went back to Memphis and told everybody,
'There's no way in the world we're going to beat those guys.' "
Dunn grew even more certain when he started game-planning for the
Trojans with his own defense at Memphis. He had been a football coach
for 21 years and had always played a five-man defensive front, usually in
a 5-3-3 alignment: five linemen, three linebackers, three defensive backs.
But Dunn looked at USC and saw too much speed to defend with five
bulky defensive linemen; he just had too many slow-footed players and
too few fast ones.
In his moment of need, he was struck by an idea. "I didn't think we
could just line up and play against USC," recalls Dunn. "But I thought
maybe we could run something that would confuse them. So here's what
we did: We backed up the two defensive ends about seven yards off the
line of scrimmage and about three yards outside the tight end, or wher-
ever the tight end would normally be. We put those guys in space. Once
I had the idea, it was a pretty easy transition to make."
In fact, it was jarring, a sea change in defensive scheming. But some
minds accept risk more readily than others. Two decades earlier Dunn
212

SPREAD STOPPERS
had coached a season of high school football in Georgia with a coach
named Bob Nellums. "He did all kinds of crazy things," says Dunn. "He'd
stand the whole defensive line up. Nobody with a hand on the ground. He
was creative and changeable. I always remembered that."
Moving the defensive ends back and outside turned Memphis State's
5-3-3 into a 3-3-5, with those defensive ends acting essentially as hy-
brid linebacker-strong safeties. In the post-Marinovich era, USC was
attempting to run some option football with quarterback Reggie Perry.
Memphis State's alignment brought defenders in closer to the edge at
the snap and filled open space on the field.
It was not an immediate
success. Before a half-full Coliseum, USC took a 10-3 halftime lead;
Trojans tailback Mazio Royster rushed for 97 yards on 20 carries in the
first 30 minutes.
But Memphis State owned the second half. USC failed to score again,
making just three first downs in the first 20 minutes as Memphis took
control. The Tigers put up 21 consecutive points to win 24-10. The upset
reverberated through the college football world. There had always been
upsets, but in the fall of 1991, college football was still a game of haves
and have-nots. The day after the defeat USC coach Smith would call the
loss "perhaps the biggest upset, disappointment and embarrassment this
university and football program has ever had."
For Dunn, it was, of course, equally shocking. "Really a remarkable vic-
tory," he says, nearly two decades later, still amazed by what took place that
afternoon in Los Angeles. But it was something more than an upset. It was
a small window into the future of the college game, where long-held prin-
ciples would give way to a new set of rules. Nevertheless, the next weekend
in Memphis, the Tigers played host to Mississippi and Memphis State went
back to Joe Lee Dunn's 5-3-3 defense. "But I didn't forget about that USC
game," says Dunn. "I put that 3-3-5 in the back of my mind."
Abilene, Texas
November 2009
MAYBE THIS
is the last stop for Joe Lee Dunn.
It
is a Wednesday in
November, and another season is coming to a close, his 39th as a football
coach. He has landed as defensive coordinator at tiny NCAA Division III
213

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
McMurry University (enrollment: 1,500) in Abilene, where Hal Mumme
is now the coach. In 2007, when Mumme, the erstwhile pioneer of the
spread passing game, was named head coach at New Mexico State he felt
himself slipping down the coaching ladder he'd once climbed. Dunn had
just been fired a year before back at Memphis after three seasons under
coach Tommy West. So Mumme, once bedeviled at Kentucky by Dunn's
varied and relentless blitzes at Mississippi State, had hired Dunn to run
the Aggies' defense.
After four years at New Mexico State, Mumme was fired, and now
had dropped another rung, to McMurry. On this day there is but a sliver
of hope for a successful end to the season: McMurry had begun the
campaign with four consecutive losses then turned it around with four
consecutive wins before falling at home to Hardin-Simmons 21-10. In
a few days the season would end 489 miles to the east in Pineville,
La., against a very good team at Louisiana College. "I think we've got a
chance to win," Dunn says, "but I'm afraid the guys are kind of deflated
after last week, losing at home to our rival and all. So I don't know ..."
It's a grueling bus ride, nearly eight hours each way, across Texas and
over the border into Louisiana. And, sure enough, McMurry gets pasted,
55-13. For much of the long, quiet ride home, Dunn will settle in and
read a book, but he takes a little time to reflect on all the years gone by. "I
started out this way," he says. "I guess maybe I'll end up this way."
He had been a high school quarterback and defensive back in the
mid-1960s at Columbus (Ga.) High, where he played under former
Auburn All-America Jim Pyburn. "You talk about mean as a snake,
that was Coach Pyburn," says Dunn. "But he was a heck of a football
coach." Dunn played in college at Chattanooga, then coached at sev-
eral high schools before starting his long college career with a nine-
year run (1971-79) back at his alma mater, Chattanooga.
Dunn coached low-down, nasty defense at every level. He pushed
bodies up to the line of scrimmage, filling the box with tacklers. He
blitzed like crazy. "But I got to be honest with you," he says. "People
didn't throw it around all that much, didn't spread out all those wide
receivers." From 1980 through '86, he coached at the University of
New Mexico, the last four seasons as head coach. Every year the Lobos
played Brigham Young. And there Dunn saw how different the game
214

SPREAD STOPPERS
could be. Brigham Young did throw it around and did spread out all
those wide receivers. And Dunn decided he would not sit back and
watch. The '80 Lobos beat BYU 25-21 and pounded Jim McMahon.
"By the end of the game," says Dunn, "Jim was throwing the ball at
his linemen's feet just to get rid of it." New Mexico lost to Brigham
Young in each of the subsequent six years, sometimes by huge margins
(66-21 in 1983), sometimes by very small margins (31-30 in '86). But
Dunn never stopped bringing the heat. "Joe Lee Dunn was a blitzing
guy," says Robbie Bosco, the Brigham Young starting quarterback dur-
ing three of those seasons, from '83 through '85. "You knew what you
were going to get, and you knew you were going to get it all day."
Dunn began to understand that creativity and speed were going to be
the new keys to defensive survival.
He was not alone in reaching this revelation. When little-known
Oklahoma State head coach Jimmy Johnson took over at the Univer-
sity of Miami in 1984 (in the season immediately after Howard Schnel-
lenberger had guided the Hurricanes to a stunning upset of Nebraska
in the '83 Orange Bowl to win the national title), he took a good look
around and promptly reached into the deep well of speed and athletic
talent in Florida's high schools. Stressing speed over size in his recruit-
ing, Johnson began changing the way positions were deployed, shrink-
ing the acreage of the field.
"We took safeties and made them linebackers; we took linebackers and
made them defensive linemen," says Butch Davis, who came to Miami
with Johnson from Oklahoma State as the 'Canes defensive-line coach.
"Jimmy wanted to make every position faster.
It was
all about speed."
It was a philosophy that helped Johnson win a national title in the 1987
season, and when it worked for Johnson at Miami, every college coach in
the country, it seemed, tried to follow suit.
Dunn, meanwhile, kept moving: Two years
at South Carolina in
1987-88 (it was there that his best friend, head coach and former New
York Giants flanker Joe Morrison, died of a heart attack; Dunn found
him on the floor of the locker room shower). He went on to Memphis
and that epic upset of USC, then to Mississippi (where the Rebels led
the nation in defense in '93), then to Arkansas for a single year, in '95.
He landed at Mississippi State in the spring of 1996 and would spend
215

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
seven years in Starkville under coach Jackie Sherrill. There Dunn finally
went fully back to the 3-3-5 for the first time since that Labor Day in L.A.
in 1991. He did
it because, like Jimmy Johnson, he wanted to put fast
people in space. But he also did it because he just couldn't find enough
big defensive linemen to play a 4-3 or a 5-3-3.
"About the time
I got to Mississippi State," says Dunn, "it started to
be where there were not a lot of schools in the country that could get big
oF defensive linemen. It's hard to find those big guys that are really good.
And if you're at Mississippi State and you do find one of them, Florida
is probably going to come in and take him away from you. Or Texas. Or
somebody like that. But if you're willing to go to a 3-3-5, look, you can
get good people on the field. When you're out recruiting, everybody's got
linebackers. Everybody's got strong safeties. Put those guys out there and
let them make plays for you."
Dunn helped turn Starkville, Miss., into every other SEC team's worst
nightmare. In 1996 the Bulldogs beat No. 8 Alabama, and a year later
they knocked off No. 11 Auburn. By '98 Mississippi State was a big dog,
advancing to the SEC title game and a loss to Tennessee in the Georgia
Dome. In 1999 Dunn's defense led the nation, giving up a paltry 222 yards
a game. All of this Dunn did with his bold 3-3-5, using five defensive
backs—two corners, two strong safeties and a free safety.
Dunn worked his scheme relentlessly. He spent one off-season learn-
ing how to pressure with a three-man front, getting schooled on slants
and stunts by Michigan head coach Gary Moeller, who had been Bo
Schembechler's defensive coordinator. He worked to recruit free safe-
ties who could tackle; in the 3-3-5, the free safety is the often the first
man to the ball.
It was serendipitous
that while Dunn was going
all-in with the
3-3-5
on his side of the ball, spread formations were proliferating
throughout college football on the offensive side. The 3-3-5,
it turns
out,
is well-suited to defending the modern spread. In the 3-3-5, the
down linemen almost always slant left or right, and behind them— of-
ten "stacked" directly behind them—the linebackers fill gaps left by the
slanting linemen. Consequently, offensive linemen are forced to push
deep downfield to block in the running game, often tipping off the di-
rection of the play with their movements in space long after the snap.
216

SPREAD STOPPERS
The two outside defensive backs act as conventional corners, but the
three other DBs can play either zone against four wideouts or straight
man-to-man against five wides. (Typically, if Dunn sees five wides, he's
blitzing six defenders against five blockers and gambling that he can get
to the quarterback before one of those five wides beats somebody.)
It would be an exaggeration to say that the 3-3-5 can shut down the
modern spread. From 1991, when Dunn first put those linemen in space,
through 2007, passing yardage increased in major college football by
more than 43 yards a game and scoring by nearly five points a game.
The 3-3-5 is a defensive answer, but not a solution. "In the last 10 or 12
years, somebody decided that fans like scoring," says Dunn. "They let
offensive players hold now. They don't let defensive backs hit receivers
after they release. I don't like all of that, but I suppose it's good for the
game. We're just doing the best we can."
And Dunn's phone never stops ringing. "You wouldn't believe how
much it rings," he says. "People calling and asking about the 3-3-5. 1 just
tell 'em what I know."
Fort Worth, Texas
November 2009
A CAR trolls the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex; TCU head coach Gary
Patterson is at the wheel. Patterson, too, is just doing the best he can,
and that's mighty good in the autumn of 2009. He is three days away
from a regular-season-ending 51-10 trouncing of New Mexico, which
will leave his Horned Frogs with a 12-0 record and their first perfect
season in 71 years. "We can play with anybody," Patterson will say after
that game. He has put TCU into the middle of the BCS discussion, and
as messy and convoluted as that discussion can be, it's important that
the boundaries of the system be tested by schools once regarded as
outsiders. Like TCU.
As Patterson guided TCU onto that hallowed ground, he was 49
years old. At the same time that Joe Lee Dunn, 14 years Patterson's
elder, was contemplating a 500-mile bus ride across Texas and Louisi-
ana and the approaching end of his career, Patterson's name was sur-
facing in connection with the soon-to-be-vacant coaching job at Notre
217

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Dame. Different men in very different stages of their careers, yet they
came from a similar place in the small world of football coaching.
In Patterson's tenure as defensive coordinator and head coach (fol-
lowing the departure of his mentor, Dennis Franchione), the Horned
Frogs have won 103 regular season games in twelve years; they won
four consecutive bowl games from 2005 through '08 and crashed the
party of college football royalty; they have won with Texas talent and
with
all the organizational efficiency and passion any rising program
must have. They have also won with the 4-2-5 defense. It is but a distant
cousin to Dunn's 3-3-5, but it was founded on similar principles.
Patterson,
like
so many of his
peers, has
risen unglamorous-
ly through the coaching ranks:
Before landing
at TCU, he made
10 stops in 16 years at the likes of Tennessee Tech and Cal Lutheran.
He even coached a few months in 1992 in the quickly defunct Pro-
fessional Spring Football League with the Oregon Lightning Bolts.
He is a small-town football junkie from Rozel, Kans. (pop. 156), di-
vorced with three sons, now remarried. He plays a mean guitar. He
also earned his football degree on a tough road, playing two years
of strong safety and linebacker in junior college and two years as a
walk-on at Kansas State in '80 and '81 on teams that won six games
in those two seasons.
Here is a good example of how coaching alliances tend to form: During
Patterson's junior year at Kansas State, Dennis Franchione was a member
of coach Jim Dickey's staff; Dick Bumpas would join the staff in '81. Both
Bumpas and Patterson would work with Franchione at Tennessee Tech
in '83 and '84. In '88 Franchione hired Patterson to coach linebackers at
Pittsburg State University. Four years later, in the fall of 1992, Patterson
landed at Utah State, along with Bumpas.
The Aggies then played in the Big West Conference with the likes of
New Mexico State and UNLV. They played Brigham Young and Utah out
of the conference. In any given season they were going to see far more
passes than runs. Like Joe Lee Dunn nearly a decade earlier, Patterson
and Bumpas had to figure out how to stop the passing game.
"We had to develop, we had to change," says Patterson. "The pass-
ing game was changing everything. When Coach Bump and
I got to
Utah State with Charlie Weatherbie, that's when we really started do-
218

SPREAD STOPPERS
ing things differently." In the 4-4-3 Patterson and Bumpas used two
cornerbacks and one deep safety. In the Big West they went more often
to what would become the 4-2-5, with
five defensive backs instead
of three. As with Dunn's defense, three were strong-safety types, two
were corners. As with Jimmy Johnson's defense, the 4-2-5 put more
speedy athletes on the field, the better to play in space and attack the
passing game.
In Patterson's second year at Utah State the Aggies rebounded from
a 1-5 start to finish 7-5. After Utah State slipped to 3-8 the following
season, Patterson followed Weatherbie to Navy for a season. Franchione
then hired Patterson at New Mexico for '96 and '97 before getting the
TCU job and handing the defense to Patterson. Three years later coach
Fran was gone, and Patterson was in charge. In 2004 he brought Dick
Bumpas back as his coordinator. The Patterson-Bumpas alliance was
rejoined, and for the greater good of the Horned Frogs.
Patterson-has run the 4-2-5 for 12 years in Forth Worth. "It fits with
five-receiver offenses," says Patterson, "because you've already got five
defensive backs in the game." But
it has endured
its growing pains.
In 2004 Patterson's fourth year as head coach, Texas Tech, with Mike
Leach's precision spread, beat the Frogs 70-35 in Lubbock. Two years
later Tech returned the game in Fort Worth, and TCU held the high-
flying Red Raiders without a touchdown in a 12-3 victory. Patterson
and Bumpas aggressively zone-blitzed Tech out of the 4-2-5 and just as
aggressively mixed coverages behind the blitzes.
"Let me put it this way," says Leach. "I wasn't real impressed with Pat-
terson's 4-2-5 when we put 70 points on 'em. But I was pretty impressed
when they held us to three points. That doesn't happen too often."
It should be noted that the TCU team that gave up 70 points was a
5-6 team; the team that gave up three points was a much more talented
11-2 team. Both played the 4-2-5, but the better team played a more
evolved version. As any coach will remind you, the quality of the athletes
deeply influences the effectiveness of the system.
"A lot of people play the 4-2-5 now," says Patterson. "But nobody
runs it like we do. Over the years we've made changes. Our answer to
any offense used to be: We'll just blitz one more [defender] than you
can block. That's not our only answer anymore. We've evolved. We
219

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
can zone-blitz you out of a two-deep shell. We can zone-blitz you out
of a three-deep shell. We'll never leave ourselves in a single high free
safety. And we will always play with great leverage and speed."
Leverage
is a vital word in the lexicon of modern defense and es-
sential to the Patterson-Bumpas philosophy. Patterson explains leverage
in simple terms: "If [a TCU defender] starts deeper than [an offensive
player], you don't ever let him get deeper than you. If you start outside
someone, you don't let him get outside you. If you start inside, you don't
let him get inside you."
When Texas Tech scored those 10 touchdowns on TCU in '04, Patter-
son says his defense was unprepared for yet another leap of offensive
evolution. "The passing game changed again," Patterson says. "They
weren't just throwing
it a lot and spreading you out, but everybody
went to a three-step passing game. Three steps, pump fake, throw." Of-
fensive plays were suddenly unfolding more quickly. Filling space was
no longer sufficient in the 4-2-5; TCU had to close down that space
quickly and make sure tackles on receivers, or the yards-after-catch
would accrue like high interest. "We had to sit down [cover tightly] on
some routes; we had to zone-blitz a little more," says Patterson. "We
went out on the road in the spring and learned from other teams, and
we added everything. You've got to do that. You've got to leave your ego
at the door. Look, all of us as defensive coaches would like to just get
in our base defense and be better than the other team's offense. But of-
fenses are just too good.
"Here's the way I figure it," says Patterson. "Let's say an offense runs
60 plays, which is about average for a game. You're gonna need a better
call than them on about 30 of those plays. That takes a lot of work, a lot of
preparation, and every offense is different. Texas Tech plays the spread;
Air Force runs the option."
There is another factor. A common axiom in recruiting (and drafting)
is that teams select the best athletes and find a way to use them. Pat-
terson dismisses that thinking. He and Bumpas have been running the
4-2-5 for nearly two decades and know what it takes to play each posi-
tion in the scheme and play them well. They look for certain key quali-
ties, including versatility. For instance,
6' 3", 257-pound All-America
defensive end Jerry Hughes, a senior in 2009, had been a high school
220

SPREAD STOPPERS
tailback, quick and agile. "You recruit to fill a certain role," says Patter-
son. "You can't just grab athletes and hope they fit."
Modern defense is a game of survival.
It is rare to win by shutting
down an opponent, inconceivable to win by shutting down a dozen. As
a defensive coach, especially when, like Patterson, you're bouncing to
a new job almost every year, you learn to understand the realities. "All
you're trying to do is get the offense back in the huddle," says Patterson.
"Not kicking off."

the DoubleA Gap blitzputs extraordinary pressure on the
offensive line andforcesprotection adjustments that limit
offensive possibilities. Two inside linebackers line up on either
side ofthe offensive center (in the A gaps'), both as ifpreparing
to blitz. Whether they actually blitz or not, the offense must
call aprotection change to block them, which can open up
other holesfor blitzersfrom other angles. In this diagram the
offensive line optsfor a "slideprotection" to its right to cover the

DOUBLE A
GAP BLITZ
All the late nights inJimJohnson's office paid off in
what may be the ultimate defensive weapon— so far
to Dallas and Green Bay, games in which their defense gave up a total of
80 points. In Week 3 they had trailed Washington 17-3 at halftime, only
to rally to a desperate 24-17 victory that, in essence, kept their season vi-
able, given that the long-term prognosis for NFL teams opening 0-3 is ex-
ceptionally poor. But it was a week later in creaky Giants Stadium that the
team's season—which would climax with an upset win over the unbeaten
New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII—truly turned.
Their opponents that Sunday night were the Philadelphia Eagles, who
had also recovered from an 0-2 start with a 56-21 destruction of the Detroit
Lions. The core of the Eagles' 2004 NFC championship team was
still in
place, Donovan McNabb
still the quarterback. The Eagles could not have
imagined that they would enter the NFL record book that evening, but when
the night was over, the Giants had tied an NFL record with 12 quarterback
sacks, including a team-record six by fifth-year defensive end Osi Umenyio-
ra. "And it wasn't just the six sacks he got," Giants linebacker Antonio Pierce
said that day. "He probably caused the other six sacks too."
In the short view, perhaps,
it was just one man's incredible perfor-

mance. But in the longer view, the last day of September 2007 was one of
those moments when football evolution, generally a gradual unfolding of
innovation and change, reaches critical mass and surges forward.
The Giants defense that took down McNabb 12 times was coached by
first-year defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, who dialed up an end-
less array of blitzes to confuse the Eagles' offensive line, including, among
the victims, substitute left tackle Winston Justice, who was playing for
the injured Tra Thomas that day. Justice, who would become a starter,
remembers the game
all too painfully. "It seemed like they came from
everywhere that day," he says. "It wasn't one guy or one blitz."
But it was one scheme that set the tone: the Double A Gap Blitz, in which
two linebackers blitz—or threaten to blitz—the quarterback from positions
on the left and right shoulders of the offensive center (the "A" gaps), trying
to get immediate pressure via the shortest route and forcing the offense into
a series of quick and potentially dangerous decisions. "We ran it a bunch of
times in that game, with Antonio Pierce and Kawika Mitchell in the A gaps,"
recalls Spagnuolo. "It presented some problems for the Eagles, obviously."
The Giants' defensive game plan had been devised just that week, but the
foundation was laid eight years earlier when Spagnuolo was hired as a de-
fensive quality control assistant—the bottom of the coaching food chain—for
the Eagles. The head coach was Andy Reid. The defensive coordinator was
57-year-old Jim Johnson.
It was Johnson who would teach Spagnuolo de-
fense, and influence the entire league in the first decade of the new century.
Columbia, Mo.
September 1959
THE DOUBLE A Gap is a product of many elements in the sport that came
before it, but it was crystallized in one man's brainstorm.
Upon his arrival at the University of Missouri in the fall of 1959, com-
ing from his home in Maywood,
111., Jim Johnson played both ways-
quarterback and safety—on a good freshman team, then joined the varsity
under coach Dan Devine for the best three-year run in school history.
The Tigers went 11-0 in I960, won the Big Eight title and beat Navy
21-14 in the Orange Bowl to finish ranked No. 5 in the nation; Johnson was
a sophomore safety and backup quarterback. A year later he started at safety
224

DOUBLE A GAP BLITZ
on a 7-2-1 team whose two losses were by a combined total of eight points; as
a senior he was the starting quarterback when Mizzou went 8-1-2 and beat
Georgia Tech in the Bluebonnet Bowl. In that senior year of '62, Johnson
played in a backfield that included future NFL personnel executive Bill Tobin
(Johnson's best friend) and future pro players Andy Russell (who would star
at linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers) and Johnny Roland (who played
eight years at running back in the NFL with the Cardinals and the Giants).
That team pounded opponents by running out of the Delaware Wing T.
"We ran the power sweep all day," says Tobin. Johnson attempted a mere
33 passes in his entire senior season, completing 12. Tobin was the Tigers'
leading receiver, with three catches. But because Johnson had been a de-
fensive player the year before, he had seen football both from the deep
secondary and from the offensive backfield, leaving him ideally qualified
to understand certain nuances of the sport. "He was always very obser-
vant," says Tobin. "He understood everything he was seeing out there."
After two years fighting unsuccessfully for a spot in the NFL, Johnson
was named the first head coach at Missouri Southern State College, build-
ing the program in 1967 and fielding its first team in '68. He subsequently
spent four years at Drake, four years at Indiana and seven at Notre Dame,
where Devine was the head coach. Johnson's first NFL job was from 1986
to '93 with the Cardinals, where his mentor was the respected but conser-
vative Fritz Shurmur. When Johnson went to the Indianapolis Colts in the
mid-'90s, his defensive philosophy took a sharp turn. Frustrated at getting
nickel-and-dimed on long drives by the evolving West Coast offense, John-
son began conceiving unorthodox blitzes.
On Nov. 16, 1997, the 0-10 Colts, struggling with injuries, knocked off the
defending Super Bowl champion Packers 41-38 at the RCA Dome in India-
napolis. Johnson blitzed all day, and his defense gave up 441 yards in offense
but also sacked Brett Favre three times, intercepted two passes and left a
lasting impression on Green Bay assistant coach Andy Reid. "We scored a lot
of points that day, but Jim destroyed our protections with his blitzes," says
Reid. "I told myself that day, If I'm ever lucky enough to get a head coaching
job in this league, that guy is going to be my defensive coordinator."
Two years later Reid was hired to coach the Eagles and made good
on his promise, hiring Johnson, then 57, as defensive coordinator. They
would work together for a decade, an eternity in the high-pressure, high-
225

turnover NFL. Johnson would die in July of 2009 of complications from
melanoma; by then he and Reid had made the playoffs seven times, and
reached the Super Bowl at the end of the 2004 season.
On a December morning in 2009, Reid sat in an office at the Eagles'
headquarters and recalled his friend and colleague. "The first time I met
Jim was in Hawaii at the Pro Bowl, and it was before that game in India-
napolis," said Reid. "We were at the pool at the hotel and our families
were there, and I just went up and introduced myself.
"Right from the beginning," says Reid, "Jim was real. From a coaching
standpoint, I didn't want to get in the way of his creativity. Jim was a brilliant
guy. And for me, as a young coach [Reid was 40 when he took the job], Jim
supported everything I was doing. It was never about offense versus defense.
It was always about us. I probably did some things that Jim was thinking,
Holy Toledo, what's this guy doing? But he never said anything like that."
Johnson installed multiple blitzes as soon as he arrived. He focused
most of his pregame preparation on an opponents' pass protections and
designing blitzes to exploit their weaknesses. "Jim wasn't worried about
what teams did in the running game or how they ran pass routes," says
Spagnuolo. "Instead, he studied protections and attacked them." Johnson's
peers chided him about his blitz-crazy schemes. They told him it was his
"retirement defense," saying that because he was getting up in age, he
didn't mind taking risks—he'd be retiring soon anyway.
He spent time talking to offensive line coaches and struck up a particu-
lar friendship with Eagles O-line coach Juan Castillo. "Jim and Juan would
get together all the time and talk about pass protections," says Reid, "and
then Jim would go back down to his office and create the blitz."
On the practice field Johnson was tough on players. He despised men-
tal errors. "My first minicamp as a rookie, I was supposed to blitz on this
particular play," says Eagles strong safety Quintin Mikell, who arrived in
Philly in 2003. "Well, I'm trying to learn the city and my teammates and
the defensive system, and I didn't blitz. I figured it would be O.K. It was
not O.K. Jim came up to me, yelling and cursing me out: 'Don't you know
what you're supposed to be doing there? You're supposed to be on a fuck-
ing blitz!' Man, he gave it to me. But I'll tell you what else: If you got beat
because the offense made a great play, he would not take you down. He
understood that sometimes the offense makes a play."
226

DOUBLE A GAP BLITZ
Says Spagnuolo, who worked under Johnson, "He was hard on players
and hard on coaches, but he had a heart bigger than you can imagine. He
was tough on everybody because he was trying to get us ready for what we
were going to face on Sunday."
The Double A Gap came in 2001. It was Johnson's ultra-aggressive ex-
tension of everything he'd been doing, first conjured when Johnson asked
himself this question: Instead of a single blitzer on the edge or a single
blitzer in the middle, why not load up the middle of the formation? The
first time Johnson called
it in a game, Eagles defensive tackle Darwin
Walker came unblocked for a sack. From 2000 to '08 the Eagles had 390
sacks, second in the NFL. In '07 Spagnuolo moved on to the Giants as de-
fensive coordinator and built on the Double A, using it as a foundation for
the pressure defense that would sack Tom Brady five times and keep him
under siege all night in the Giants' 17-14 upset win in Super Bowl XLII.
"The thing about the Double A," says Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter,
who was with the team whenJohnson installed the scheme and rejoined them
in '09 for his third tour, "is that it doesn't really have a major weakness."
JIM JOHNSON was gone before the 2009 season began, having passed away
shortly before the Eagles broke training camp in Bethlehem, Pa. But his leg-
acy was firmly established. NFL defense had become a game not of whether
to blitz, but ofwhich blitz to use. "Right now, in the NFL, it's blitzkrieg," said
Washington Redskins offensive line coach Joe Bugel, a 35-year league coach-
ing veteran, in the fall of 2009. "If you're going to have your quarterback
throw out of seven-step drop, you better have about 12 offensive linemen."
The Double A Gap Blitz is one of the most popular among many blitz
options for aggressive defenses (which now means all defenses). It usu-
ally begins with the defense in "nickel personnel," or five defensive backs.
There are also usually four down linemen and two linebackers in a 4-2-5
configuration (although it can be run from various other sets). As the of-
fense reaches the line of scrimmage, the two linebackers move menacing-
ly into the two A gaps. If the quarterback is under center, the 'backers can
probably smell his breath, and he theirs. "At that point it's mental gym-
nastics," says former Raiders and Bucs head coach Jon Gruden. "There's
no doubt there's going to be some penetration in the middle if they blitz,
and it's going to mess with your blocking schemes."
227

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
The offense has several options, none of them ideal.
• Gap (or squeeze) protection, in which both guards block down inside, put-
ting three big bodies on the two blitzing linebackers. This, however, forces
the offensive tackles to block down as well, in order to pick up the two de-
fensive tackles, and it leaves some combination of running backs and tight
ends to deal with edge-rushing defensive ends like Dwight Freeney, Jared
Allen or Elvis Dumervil. "They're trying to create a negative one-on-one
matchup with your halfback," says Broncos quarterback Kyle Orton.
• Slide protection, in which the entire offensive line slides one way, with
the center picking up one blitzer and one guard picking up the other. The
same problem results with one defensive end left rushing against a run-
ning back or, at best, a tight end or H-back.
• Straight protection, in which the center takes one blitzer, and the other
one is allowed a free release to the running back, who must make a key
block in the quarterback's lap. "This blitz has changed what you need in a
running back," says Bugel. "He's got to be able to pass-block, or you really
can't have him on the field."
Even if the back stops the blitzing linebacker, his involvement in that
block prevents him from helping out on any other pass rusher. "You like
to have your running back chip the defensive end, stick an elbow in the
guy's ribs off the edge," says Gruden. "But if the defense shows a Double
A Gap, that running back is going to be too late to chip, so you're one-on-
one with Dumervil or Freeney on the outside."
Another consideration: It's perilous to leave the quarterback under cen-
ter. "It's imperative that you get into the shotgun, to give the quarterback
some breathing room," says former Giants head coach and Ravens offen-
sive coordinator Jim Fassel. "But you really need to know what situations
you might see it in, because it's hard to check to the 'gun."
The most devilish aspect of the Double A is that the linebackers don't even
need to blitz in order to make the play effective. "And you can't be sure," says
Gruden. "Defenses aren't stupid. Those linebackers will get up there in the
A gaps, but they won't have blinking red lights on their helmets with signs say-
ing, 'I'm coming.' " Because the Double A threatens to bring pressure so close
to the quarterback and so quickly, the offense must adjust to one of the above
protections on the assumption that the A gap rushers are going to blitz.
"Once those two linebackers are down inside, [the offense has] got to
228

DOUBLE A GAP BLITZ
deal with them and tip their hand," says Mikell. "That's the whole thing
with the Double A, make them adjust and then attack." Empty backfield
sets, with five wide receivers, make it difficult to adjust, and so are clearly
impractical against teams that favor the Double A.
There are numerous other variations of this blitz. In '07, Spagnuolo
rotated defensive ends Justin Tuck and Umenyiora into the A gaps and
linebackers Pierce and Mitchell to the edge, creating an even more daunt-
ing mismatch—Tuck or Umenyiora on a running back or center—on the
inside. The Giants called that combination Bombs. Other teams have
dropped both 'backers into coverage and rushed a safety late, after the
offense has committed to countering the A gap rushers.
The best way to exploit the Double A is to effectively block it, a difficult
proposition. Or, says Gruden, "If you're using it against a CEO-type quar-
terback, like a Peyton Manning or Drew Brees, who understands how to
pick up blitzes, you can have problems because you're short of personnel
in coverage and they'll get rid of the ball quickly."
Says Trotter, "Teams run quick screens, slants, things like that, because
normal pass routes take too long and the pressure is right on the quar-
terback. Jim Johnson always told us, 'You take away great receivers by
getting in the quarterback's face.' "
THEY ECHO his messages like that in Philadelphia. Around the league
they copy his plays. Johnson would appreciate that. During game week
he could always be found in his office long after practice, working the
coordinator's customary hours, searching for seams in somebody's of-
fense. "He brought an energy and an enthusiasm to figuring things
out," says Reid. "The players couldn't wait to hear how Jim was going
gash 'em this week."

POWERRUN RIGHT (NO HUDDLE)
VS. DIME DEFENSE
The '80s Cincinnati Bengals used the no-huddle more often andmore
effectively than any team before or since. Coach Sam Wyche says he hadgreat
success by going to a quick snap on apower run immediately after converting
a third-and-long against a dime (six defensive backs) defense. Theploy here
is to quickly run two tight ends onto thefieldand remove two wide receivers
(from thepreviousplay), then line up in a two-tight endformation (though
anypower runningformation could be used) before the defense can change
personnel. The defense is stillstuck with six DBs andjust one linebacker, a
weak alignment against apower run.

SUDDEN DEATH PLAYOFF PERIOD
THIS GAME, which the Colts would win in overtime 23-17, has long been
described as the event that propelled pro football into its place as an all-
consuming entertainment industry in the 21st century. Itwas a perfect conflu-
ence of sport, drama and television, portending the formula that would make
football such ideal mass-market programming in the years that followed.
It is likely that professional football would have arrived where it lives
today regardless of what took place on that afternoon and early evening
on the hard ground of Yankee Stadium. The path might have been more
circuitous, and taken longer, but in
all certainty the NFL would have
eventually captured America and America would have eventually become
enraptured by the NFL.
Still, the process was helped significantly on that night in New York
by the remarkable performance of Baltimore quarterback John Unitas
and by his execution of the Colts' hurry-up offense—as
it was called
even back then—over Baltimore's last five plays from scrimmage in reg-
ulation time. Old-school NFL players will tell you that the two-minute
drill, in which teams attempt to move quickly down the field, running a
maximum number of plays in a minimum amount of time (often with-
out huddling), had been a part of the game long before Unitas displayed
it in the nation's living rooms.
"Bobby Layne was in the NFL when I came into the league in 1959,"
says Dick LeBeau, who played in the NFL from '59 through '72 before
becoming one of the league's most respected coaches. "He was a master
of the comeback, using the clock in the fourth quarter. Otto Graham [the
Hall of Fame QB who retired after the '55 season] was the same way; I re-
member watching him when I was in college and hearing about him from
other players in the league. Y.A. Tittle [who retired in '64 after a 17-year
career] could also take a team down the field at the end of the game."
But it was Unitas who turned the no-huddle, two-minute offense into
theater, and he did it most dramatically in the '58 championship game.
Twice during the final drive Unitas called two plays in the huddle, and
twice the Colts lined up immediately after completions and ran another
232

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
play without calling time out. It was standard procedure for any football
team trying to rally at the end of a game with little time left, but it was
Unitas's cool and precision in such a big event in such a grand venue that
thrilled the audience tuning in on TV.
Here was football played with breathtaking urgency. Baseball, the un-
disputed national pastime, couldn't be played this way: A tie game in the
ninth proceeds with essentially the same tempo as any other inning. In the
fourth-quarter hurry-up comeback, football had come upon something
fascinating—a better version of itself. Yet nearly three decades would pass
before a team and a coach would ask why that intensive pace had never
been employed over the course of an entire game.
Cincinnati, 1984
THE GAME'S spider web of innovation reaches to all corners of the coun-
try, yet it seems that a distinctly disproportionate amount of football ge-
nius has lived and worked in this Midwestern city. It was here in 1970 that
Bill Walsh invented the West Coast offense. It was here in '83 that LeBeau
first tinkered with the defensive pressure packages that would come to
be known as the zone blitz. It was here in '86 that Jim McNally (who, in
geographical fairness, borrowed from the experiments of Howard Mudd
not far away in Cleveland) became one of the first professional coaches to
fully commit to a zone blocking scheme.
And it was here, in 1984, that a quirky coach named Sam Wyche be-
came the first NFL coach—and most assuredly one of the first at any level
of the game—to transform the two-minute drill into the 60-minute drill.
Or, as Wyche puts it demurely, "We did everything on offense that we had
always done. We just gave up the privacy of the huddle and let the defense
listen in."
(A footnote: Use of the huddle dates to the earliest days of football, but
the implementation of organized, every-play huddling is widely credited
to H.W (Bill) Hargiss at Oregon State in 1918. Interestingly, in his '27
coaching manual, Pop Warner referenced not only the huddle but also the
no-huddle, writing, "If the huddle system is not used, the field general
should give his signals in such a tone of voice and in such a manner that
they will be easily heard and understood.")
233

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Wyche was raised in Atlanta, the older brother of Bubba Wyche. Bubba
was a brilliant athlete who once struck out every opposing batter in a
Little League game, won All-State honors in three high school sports and
went on to play quarterback at Tennessee. That wasn't Sam. "I was just
a guy on the club," he told SPORTS ILLUSTRATED in 1989. "A worker, a
classic overachiever." Sam never started a high school football game but
walked on at Furman and became the starting quarterback as a sopho-
more. In '68 he networked his way onto the Bengals' taxi squad and spent
seven years in the NFL with four teams, starting just nine games.
After Wyche retired as a player, the first coach to hire him as an assistant
was Walsh, in 1979 with the 49ers. (Walsh had been Wyche's quarterback
coach a decade earlier in Cincinnati.) Wyche aided in the refinement of the
West Coast offense, then in the hands of Joe Montana. Before the '84 sea-
son, he was hired to replace Forrest Gregg as the Bengals' head coach.
Wyche would spend a dozen seasons as a head coach in the NFL, eight
with the Bengals (including a Super Bowl appearance in 1988) and four
with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He would lose more games (107) than he
would win (84) and would be better known for veering from conventional
sideline behavior than for his record. Example: During a Bengals home
game near the end of the '89 season, the Cincinnati fans grew upset with
the game officials and began heaving snowballs onto the field. Wyche,
irate, found a microphone and chastised them over the public-address
system by saying, "You don't live in Cleveland; you live in Cincinnati."
Wyche was a truly different sort of coach. While so many football
coaches fit into a box—do it this way, do it that way, do it my way—Wyche
had no box. He probably wouldn't acknowledge a box's existence.
From a strategic perspective, nothing Wyche did was further from
the norm than his decision in 1984—his first as head coach—to attempt
running a no-huddle offense for an entire game. It was something that
Wyche had thought about for years. He had once discussed with it Hank
Stram, who had been the innovative coach of the Kansas City Chiefs in
the '60s and '70s. "Neither one of us could figure out why nobody had
tried
it," says Wyche. "That really motivated me to use
it someday."
Wyche had never believed in obedience to historical practices. He liked
to try different things. He had watched Walsh substitute the short passing
game for running the ball, he had watched Montana—who was of average
234

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
size and didn't have a powerful arm—control the game, and he concluded
that you could beat opponents with your mind. "You can't go into every
game saying, 'We'll just damn well outplay you,' " Wyche told SI in '89.
"You're looking for the two-percent edge, the surprise of a safety blitz, the
surprise of having fourth-and-12 on your own 25 and going for it. These
things are sound. They work."
For Wyche, the basic idea of the no-huddle, which was installed with
the help of offensive coordinator (and former teammate) Bruce Coslet,
was to turn what
is often a desperate circumstance—the two-minute
offense—into an aggressive one. "A big part of the thinking behind the
no-huddle," says Wyche, "was saying to your opponent, 'We're going to
take away your normal recovery time. By the end of the game, you're go-
ing to be too tired to compete.' Teams couldn't fully prepare to play us in a
week, because they couldn't re-create the tempo we were using."
It was, ultimately, an all-or-nothing proposition. In Wyche's mind
there would ideally be no occasional use of the huddle. Wyche and Coslet
reworked the entire playbook to be run in no-huddle fashion. But the
process of reaching that goal would take two full seasons to shake itself
out. In the first year the starting quarterback was 14-year veteran Ken
Anderson, who had taken the Bengals to the Super Bowl after the 1981
season. But in '84 the Bengals opened the season with five consecutive
losses. Wyche decided to take a shot with a rookie.
Norman Julius (Boomer) Esiason had been the first quarterback se-
lected in the 1984 NFL draft, a 6
f 4", 210-pound lefthander who had
thrown for more than 6,000 yards in three years as the starter at Mary-
land. He was taken in the second round with the 38th overall pick (in
stark contrast to the draft a year earlier when six quarterbacks were se-
lected in the first 27 picks, three ofwhom—John Elway, Jim Kelly and Dan
Marino—are now in the Hall of Fame).
But Wyche and the Bengals were thrilled to get Esiason, who was ac-
curate and cerebral. Esiason was given a start on Oct. 7, and the Bengals
finally got a win, 13-3 over the Houston Oilers. Esiason would start three
more games that season, which the Bengals finished at 8-8. He would be-
come the full-time starter early in the '85 campaign and almost immedi-
ately clicked with the no-huddle. "My rookie year, I had to figure out what
the hell I was doing as an NFL quarterback," says Esiason, "so Sam couldn't
235

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
fully commit to the no-huddle with me. In the next year, when I was the
starter, we did a lot more of it, and then in '86 we went to it from the first
day of training camp. And I'll tell you what: I loved every minute of it."
The Bengals' no-huddle was designed to do more than just take a defense
out of its rhythm. Most important, it made it very difficult for defenses to
use situational substitutions, whether simple packages like a nickel defense
or more complex arrangements. The Bengals would run players onto the
field so quickly that it was almost impossible for a defense to identify the
Bengals' personnel and counter with the appropriate bodies. Opponents
were often forced to play with whatever people they had on the field, leav-
ing linebackers to cover wideouts or safeties to play in run support.
The mid- and late-'80s Bengals were a collection of exceptionally
bright players, including Hall of Fame left tackle Anthony Munoz and
future broadcaster Cris Collinsworth. But the heaviest intellectual load,
by far, fell on Esiason. "What Sam and Bruce demanded of me was that I
know every formation and every personnel group and which plays would
work with which personnel groups and which formations. I had to be ex-
tremely well-prepared to do all of this at the line of scrimmage."
Each play was literally a fresh start, without a huddle. Esiason explains
the sequence:
As soon as the previous play ended, Sam would send the next per-
sonnel group onto the field, and then he would signal to me with one
hand to let me know what the personnel group was that was coming
into the game. Then he would signal me with one hand for the play.
Say he gives me "regular" personnel: halfback, fullback, tight
end, two wide receivers, and we're running a play called 28 Grace,
which is the halfback to the strong side. He would give me a hand
signal for the play. I would have to know which formations we could
use for that play—pro right, far double wing right, hum short, trips
right—and then I would choose the formation I wanted to run and
communicate that to everybody on the field. This would all happen
in the first five seconds after the referee spots the ball.
So then I yell, "Regular! Regular! Regular!" That's so the people
who are not in the regular personnel group know to get off the field.
Then
I would yell the formation. Next was the play. In a huddle
I
236

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
would have said, "28 Grace," but even though defensive players are
stupid, almost anybody who has ever played football knows that even
numbers mean a run to the right. So we needed code words.
Our code words for the "2" back were Raider, Oakland and Mil-
len, because Matt Millen was playing for the Raiders at the time.
Then I had to call right. Our right words were Denver, Trigger and
Orange. Our left words were Dallas, Bullet and Black. The blocking
scheme was Grace, so I could just say Grace or sometimes
I would
say Bible or Jesus.
So we're getting lined up, and
I would say, "Hum Raider Den-
ver Bible!" Then
I would throw out a dummy call, like "399 Fly,"
that meant absolutely nothing. Then the snap count, which was also
words. That was back when Bo Jackson was doing all those Nike
commercials, so our code was A (snap on one hut) Bo (snap on two)
Can (three) Do It (four). So I'm yelling, "Hum Raider Denver Bible!
399 Fly! Do It Do It Do It! Hut Hut Hut Hut!"
ESIASON NOT only had to communicate all of this, he had to do it while
reading the defense and quickly contemplating an audible. There were
shortcuts. If a running back was uncertain of the play call, Esiason could
quickly turn around and simply tell him the play, because his back was to
the defense. "The whole exercise was football at such a high intellectual
level," says Esiason. "Every week was a final exam. But the thing it did
best was create indecision in the defense. And any indecision on their side
of the ball was to our advantage."
In 1986 the Bengals went 10-6, and Esiason passed for 3,959 yards, a
team record that stood until 2006, when Carson Palmer went over 4,000.
But a year later, in the strike-interrupted '87 season, the Bengals stum-
bled backward to a 4-11 season (1-2 in replacement games), and Wyche's
no-huddle came under intense heat. Local media called him Wicky Wacky
Wyche; and worse, they called for his head.
One year later, however, everything clicked. Esiason ran the no-huddle
beautifully, and McNally's zone blocking scheme turned Ickey Woods,
James Brooks and Stanley Wilson loose in the run game. The Bengals
opened with six consecutive wins, finished 12-4 in the regular season
and went to Super Bowl XXIII in Miami, losing 20-16 to Walsh's Nin-
237

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
ers on Montana's touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left.
The season validated Wyche's madness, and it also spawned an unlike-
ly imitator in an unlikely fashion. During the 1988 season Buffalo Bills
coach Marv Levy accused the Bengals of skirting the "spirit" of the rules
of football in their use—or nonuse— of the huddle. Most specifically, Levy
pointed to the Bengals' habit of keeping 12 or 13 players on the field as Es-
iason began calling plays. The Bengals argued that there were more than
11 players on the field because they were exchanging personnel—some
leaving the field, some entering the field; and what's more, NFL rules only
prohibit more than 11 players in the huddle.
The issue came to a head on Jan. 8, 1989, when the Bengals played
the Bills in the AFC Championship Game at Riverfront Stadium in Cin-
cinnati. According to Wyche, a representative of NFL commissioner Pete
Rozelle, who would retire 11 months later, was sent to the Bengals' locker
room. Wyche picks up the story:
"The commissioner sent a league representative into my office one
hour and 55 minutes before kickoff. [Bengals assistant G.M./legal counsel]
Mike Brown was with me, and we tape-recorded the entire conversation.
The guy tells us Marv Levy is planning to have his players fake injuries
to counteract our no-huddle. The commissioner is worried that this will
make a farce of the game and maybe we shouldn't run the no-huddle of-
fense. So I told this guy, 'You go back and tell Pete Rozelle that he's tam-
pering with the competitive balance of the AFC Championship Game less
than two hours before kickoff. How are you going to explain that to all the
bookies and gamblers who bet on this game?' The guy walked out of the
room, came back in 30 seconds and said, 'You can run the no-huddle.' "
As
it turned out, the Bengals, as a matter of strategy, ran fewer no-
huddle snaps than normal but still won the game.
The bizarre conclusion to this episode unfolded a season later, when
Levy, offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda and quarterback Jim Kelly
installed their own version of the no-huddle offense with Kelly operating
from the shotgun. Appropriately, it was called the K-Gun. Marchibroda
installed the K-Gun in training camp but used
it only sparingly in the
regular season. It became the Bills' go-to offense only on Jan. 6, 1990, in
a 34-30 divisional playoff loss to the Cleveland Browns. Kelly ran almost
exclusively from the no-huddle and threw 54 passes, completing 28 for
238

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
four touchdowns. It was the birth of an offense that the Bills would ride
to four consecutive Super Bowls, from '90 through '93.
It was also a sweet match of quarterback and system. Kelly had been a
high school star in Pennsylvania and the first in what would become a line
of accomplished quarterbacks at the University of Miami in the 1980s. But
it was not until Kelly joined the renegade United States Football League
in the fall of '83 that he really matured as a quarterback. He first played
with the Houston Gamblers, whose offensive coordinator was run-and-
shoot offense impresario Mouse Davis. Davis quickened Kelly's release
and taught him how to read defenses on the fly. All of these would be vital
skills in the K-Gun.
"We were always pretty good in the no-huddle at the end of games," Kelly
recalls in the summer of 2009. "And we were pretty good going into half-
time. Ted and Marv both decided it made sense to try it for a whole game."
There was a fundamental difference between the Bengals' no-huddle
and the K-Gun: Esiason did not call plays; Kelly did (and is regarded as
the last pro quarterback to truly call all of his own plays—as opposed to
simply choosing from among a small number of plays at the line of scrim-
mage). In the K-Gun, the Bills streamlined their offense each week down
to 20 plays, and sometimes fewer than that.
"We probably had a total of 35 or 40 plays in the playbook," says Kelly.
"We would narrow that down every week. We used different formations,
but it was always three wide receivers, one tight end, one running back
[who happened to be the great Thurman Thomas].
"For me," Kelly continues, "it was all about quickness and feel. Every-
thing had to be so quick. As soon as a guy gets tackled, you're thinking
about the down and distance and field position and you've got to call that
next play. Then you call the protection. Then you look at the defense and
see if they're in man or zone." There were certain keys to simplify Kelly's
job at the line: If the defense had seven men in the box, he would give the
ball to Thomas and run it. If there were eight in the box (an extra safety
dropped down in run support), he would get man-to-man coverage and
throw it, often to Andre Reed.
Like the Bengals who preceded them in the no -huddle, the Bills had
smart players. Reed was a clever, intuitive wide receiver. Center Kent Hull
read defenses as skillfully as Kelly. "Kent did all the line calls," says Kelly.
239

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
"There were a lot of times when
I would call a running play and Kent
would just yell, 'Get out of it!' And I would get out of it."
Kelly recalls that, again like the Bengals, the Bills had code words
for plays, formations and snap counts. For instance, a snap count of
"on three" was "Louisville," because left tackle Will Wolford wore num-
ber 73 early in his career and was born and raised in Louisville, Ky.
Occasionally a player would be traded and take his knowledge of the
Bills' signals with him. Fred Smerlas played with the Bills in 1989 but
later played against them as a New England Patriot. "Freddy knew our
signals," says Kelly. "So on the sideline I told the offense, we're calling
on two, so I'm going to call 'Noah!' " (That was the Bills signal for 'on
two' because Noah had two of each kind of animal on the ark; in this
case, though,
it was a dummy call.) "I told everybody, 'Watch Freddy
jump.' Sure enough on the second hut, Freddy ran across the line and
was standing right next to Thurman."
The effect of the K-Gun on defenses was palpable. "It wore them out,"
says Kelly. "The pass rush would diminish as the game went on. And they
couldn't disguise coverages because they couldn't substitute. They had to
show what coverage they were in. Defenses hate that. I was really fortunate as
a quarterback that Marv Levy and Ted Marchibroda let me run this offense."
History records
that the
Bills
lost four consecutive Super Bowls,
the last three by a combined 65 points. But
it's unfair to dismiss the
49 regular-season victories and four AFC titles earned with the no-huddle.
"There was this feeling," says Kelly. "You just knew what plays were go-
ing to work, and you didn't have to think. It just came to me and we went
right down the field. It was a pretty special time."
IN THE summer of 2009, 64-year-old Sam Wyche is raking rocks off a prac-
tice football field in Pickens, S.C. (pop. 3,026), where he lives, coaches high
school football and contemplates changing the world. He won a seat on the
Pickens City Council with 80% of the vote, and on this day, he is considering a
run for the U.S. House of Representatives. "There are some people who want
me to do it," he says. But he's hesitant. "The people up there in Washington,"
says Wyche, "I'm not sure I'd have the patience to work in that system."
Perhaps not. Patience was clearly not a facet of his no-huddle system.
But risk most certainly was, and risk is the chief reason why no NFL teams
240

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
since Wyche's Bengals and Kelly's Bills have installed a full-on no-huddle of-
fense, and why no NFL coach is letting his quarterback call all his own plays.
Clearly the increasing complexity of the modern game makes it a huge gam-
ble to entrust an entire playbook to a quarterback at the line of scrimmage.
The closest relative of the no-huddle in use during the 2009 season
was the Peyton Manning machine in Indianapolis. But even that was not
a no-huddle in the purest sense, because it makes no attempt at increas-
ing the tempo of the game. The Colts' entire offense loiters near the line
of scrimmage while Manning receives play calls—at least three options
on every play—from offensive coordinator Tom Moore. Wyche calls this
arrangement a sugar huddle, "because it's short and sweet."
The Colts' version brings Manning nearer to Esiason than to Kelly be-
cause he is running plays relayed from the sideline (albeit to his helmet
by transmitter, not with hand signals), and although he has the option to
change a run to a pass or a pass to a run and adjust routes on the fly, he is
not actually calling the plays. Nor is he hurrying to exhaust the defense.
Those concepts are gone for now, reduced to museum pieces, awaiting
the next coach who will roll the dice and bet his livelihood that his quar-
terback can be Unitas for 60 minutes.

BASE (A) ZOOM 18 CIRCUS
Daring even by the edgy standards ofthe radicalA-n offense, the Circus
play begins with a shotgun snap to the quarterback, who rolls right
and sets up at the right hash mark. An ineligible receiver (R, a reserve
quarterback wearing a "legal
7 lineman number, like 74) runs into the
backfieldand takes a backwardpass— by the rules a lateral—from
the QB. Thefour receivers work various routes downfield, including a
"zoom motion"shallow cross by theA receiver The "new" quarterback
delivers thepass to any one ofthem depending on coverage. Iftheplay is
runproperly, the defense is likely not only to chase the rollout (the original
QB) but also to ignore the "ineligible" quarterback until its too late.

Chapter 22
A llAND
BEYOND
When two California high school coaches found a
loophole in the rule book, they may have seen the future
met at Humphries' apartment to begin planning the 2007 campaign for
Piedmont High, located in the East Bay hills outside Oakland. It would
prove to be a fateful evening.
Bryan, then 42, was starting the second year of his second tour as head
coach at his alma mater. Humphries, another Piedmont alumnus, whose
father, Michael, had been the Highlanders' freshman coach for decades,
was the director of football operations, in his third year on the staff.
Like so many high school coaches, they shared a passion for a job
they perform tirelessly over long hours and for minimal pay. Bryan had
played at Piedmont in the early '80s, was named offensive coordinator
there in 1987 at age 23 and head coach six seasons later. He does more
than coach football; he's a full-time insurance salesman and a novelist
who has written two football-themed suspense books.
Humphries's route was different—he was a receiver and safety at Pied-
mont, played rugby at Cal, then went first into baseball coaching—but it
landed him back in the game of football at Piedmont. "Sometimes," he
says, "it takes a little while to realize what you love."

the

limbo between high school
football seasons when Kurt
Bryan and Steve Humphries
243

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
That doesn't make the job easy. In 2006, Bryan's first season back
on the sideline at Piedmont, the Highlanders went 5-5. They played
conventional football, trying to win physical battles along the line of
scrimmage, establish a running game and tackle well on the other side.
But Piedmont happens to be one of the smaller schools in its confer-
ence, and that means
its players are smaller too. Most are less than
200 pounds. In the first round of the playoffs, the Highlanders played
Miramonte High, a bigger school from nearby Orinda. Piedmont played
well but lost 13-6. That's not what Bryan remembers about the game.
"It was a brutally physical game," recalls Bryan. "We actually played
pretty well, but we just didn't hold up, physically. We'd spent a lot of time
working that game out on paper. We had stuff that should have worked if
we executed. But when it came time to play the game, we just couldn't do
it. We weren't big enough or strong enough. That was very frustrating to
me, and I felt bad for our players."
His story is as old as the game itself. In the end, many football games—
especially at the high school level, where most of the football in America
is played—come down to pure physical superiority.
Take running backs, for example. Says New England Patriots coach
Bill Belichick, "At the lower levels of the game, in high school and some-
times even in college, the best running backs are just faster than every-
body else. They get to the outside, and then they outrun everybody to
the goal." But the same simple formula applies across all positions. A
faster defensive end will beat an offensive tackle to the edge. A huge of-
fensive guard will overwhelm a smaller defensive lineman. And so on.
At the core, every offensive and defensive system ever created was de-
vised for one of two reasons: To enable a physical mismatch to take place
or to avoid being on the wrong end of a physical mismatch. Put another
way: In football, if you are the windshield, you seek out the bug. If you are
the bug, you try to avoid the windshield.
Bryan
felt like the bug.
"I went to Steve's apartment one of those
nights," he says, "and we had books and tapes and whiteboards out. At
one point Steve said to me, 'I want to show you something.' He had this
Emory and Henry-type formation."
(A brief explanation: When Steve Spurrier was coaching a highly suc-
cessful Florida program in the mid- and late-'90s, he occasionally ran
244

A-ll AND BEYOND
plays from a bizarre formation with only three interior linemen and two
sets of three wideouts, not all of whom were eligible receivers. Spurrier
called the formation Emory & Henry, for a small liberal arts college in
southwestern Virginia that had used the formation when he was growing
up in Johnson City, Tenn.)
The Emory & Henry look fascinated Bryan. "A lot of teams have 'light'
formations of some sort," Bryan said. "The Emory and Henry is a light
formation with a lot of vertical passing routes. But
I was wondering if
there might be something more we could do with
it.
I scoured the rule
book for about two days nonstop." And then he found something.
"Kurt put the book in front of me and
said, 'Look at
this,' " says
Humphries. "I give him full credit. He found it."
What Bryan found inside the national high school rule book was the ex-
ception to the scrimmage kick definition, intended for punts, which stipu-
lates that if the player taking the snap from center is at least seven yards
behind the line of scrimmage (slightly farther than a conventional shotgun
snap), then the usual uniform-number rules do not apply (i.e., the rule that
at least five players must wear "lineman numbers" 50 through 79).
Thus, Bryan realized, as long as the quarterback sets up in a deep
shotgun, a team could legally break the huddle with 11 players wearing
uniform numbers which allowed them to line up as eligible receivers.
Once lined up, some players would be rendered ineligible by formation,
but until the formation was set, any offensive player on the field repre-
sented an eligible pass receiver.
While the rule was clearly written for the punting game, Bryan envi-
sioned something else altogether—a scrimmage scheme in which every
player in the huddle was an offensive threat and the entire field was in play.
The confusion it would obviously create for the defense was tantalizing.
"Pretty unique idea," says Humphries.
The two coaches decided that night to implement the offense, which
they would call the A-ll, because
"all 11" players are potentially eligible.
Its root concept was not out of line with current trends at other levels of
football—spread offenses were overtaking the college game and evolved
passing games and offense-friendly rules changes (the five-yard no-chuck
rule, among others) were altering the NFL. For Bryan and Humphries, the
operative word was space, and they were taking that concept to its extreme.
245

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
They conceived a playbook in which the base formation was Emory &
Henry—a center flanked by two "guards," a quarterback in shotgun with
a running back nearby and two "bunches" of three wide receivers on each
side of the field. All 11 of these players wore the jersey numbers of eligible
receivers, meaning, again, that when they broke the huddle any of them
could legally catch a pass.
Football rules, however, mandate that even in "scrimmage kick for-
mation," seven players must be on the line of scrimmage when the ball is
snapped, with four players in the backfield. Of the seven on the line, only
the two on the outside (the "ends") are eligible to run downfield and re-
ceive a pass, along with three of the four backs, excluding the passer.
Yet, because the A-ll breaks the huddle with 11 potential receivers
and relies on last-second shifts before revealing the final alignment of
the formation, the defense is challenged to quickly identify the eligible
receivers on any given play. The offense was instantly successful; Pied-
mont went 7-4 in 2007 and 8-3 in 2008. Defenses were predictably
befuddled, and Piedmont piled up points.
More
surprising
were
two
other
developments.
According
to
Humphries, despite their offense having the appearance of Ultimate Fris-
bee, Piedmont had a nearly 50-50 split between the run and the pass.
Much like the one-back spread offense from the 1980s, the spread A-ll
opened up massive running lanes for ballcarriers.
Secondly, says Humphries, "we had hardly any injuries." Intuitively, this
would seem to owe to a reduction of fierce interior line battles. However,
the offense also leads to more open-field tackles, and open-field tackling
produces high-speed collisions. Despite the paradox, the evidence of fewer
injuries in the A-ll made the offense worthy of consideration at a time when
football is racked by injury concerns, particularly head trauma.
Instead, the offense was nearly killed.
Indianapolis, Ind.
February 2009
PIEDMONT'S A-ll generated intense interest. The New York Times and
ESPN were among the many media outlets that seized upon its quirky
genius and made countercultural football celebrities out of Bryan and
246

A-ll AND BEYOND
Humphries. Scientific American, in a relentlessly quoted article, calculated
that the A-ll had 16,632 possible postsnap play possibilities, whereas con-
ventional formations had only 36.
On a rainy fall Saturday at the time, a Connecticut high school coach
named Deron Bayer, whose team was running the single wing, pulled a
writer aside and began sketching the A-ll. "This
is the next thing," he
said, almost conspiratorially. "We might use it next year. All our big guys
are graduating."
Hundreds of other high school coaches were thinking the same thing.
Bryan and Humphries said they had to change their cellphone numbers
because so many coaches were calling, seeking holy water for their pro-
grams. But there was another side to the story. As much cheerleading as
there was for the novel attack, there was also vehement criticism.
The college football rule offered only a more restrictive scrimmage
kick option and the NFL has no such rule. Since there was no obvious A-ll
loophole to exploit at those levels, detractors said that this renegade of-
fense had no place in the higher strata of football. The Piedmont geniuses
were accused of corrupting the spirit of the game by contorting what is
clearly designed as an old punt rule to enable more players to run down
the field in passing routes as an every-down offense.
Technically, the
critics were
right:
That's
exactly what Bryan and
Humphries were doing. But that doesn't mean it wasn't good for football
to be exposed to such radical thinking. After
all,
if Pop Warner hadn't
thought up the single wing, football might have died before 1910, the vic-
tim of too much violence.
However, the National Federation of State High School Associations,
the organization responsible for the rule book, didn't see it that way. In
February 2009, the NFHS changed the scrimmage kick formation rule,
mandating that only the center—the long snapper—could wear an eligible
jersey number (though, at the center position, he would be ineligible),
while the other four interior linemen must wear jersey numbers from 50
to 79. Word rippled through the football world: THE A-ll IS DEAD.
But not to Bryan and Humphries. "All [the Federation] did " says Bry-
an, "is make it so that you can't throw a forward pass to those guys. But
those guys can still throw a pass. They can still take a handoff. They can
receive a pass thrown backward? So for the 2009 season the two men got
247

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
even more crafty. "And the offense, if anything," says Humphries, "got
even more deadly."
So, undaunted, the two coaches created a new term: anchors. In their
new version of the A-ll, the anchors are the "linemen" assigned to wear
jersey numbers from 50 to 79. But they are not linemen in the traditional
sense. Often they are hybrid athletes capable of playing several positions.
On Sept. 8, Oakland Tribune columnist Carl Steward covered the first
Piedmont game of what was supposed to be the post-A-11 era and wrote
the following sentence with considerable wonder: "On the Highlanders'
second play of the 2009 season Friday night against Drake of San Ansel-
mo, a Piedmont player wearing No. 77, George Fullerton, took an end-
around from quarterback Cormac Craigie for a seven-yard gain, out of a
Statue of Liberty handoff."
Bryan explains: "Just think about
it. Just because a guy is wearing
number 68, doesn't mean he can't be a fast, explosive player. Think of a
4.4 [40-yard dash] guy in that anchor position, who can receive a lateral."
Under the new rules, Bryan and Humphries could no longer present to the
defense 11 potential receivers coming out of the huddle. But they would
continue to move players into positions and roles not normally associ-
ated with their jersey numbers. And they would still use myriad forma-
tions and shifts. "This year I think we had 331 different formations," says
Humphries. "Before the rule changed, we had 232. All it did was push us
to be more creative and push out even more new formations."
The offense began to seep into other levels of football. As
it turned
out, the college rule book does, in effect, allow an A-ll-type offense when
"it is obvious that a kick may be attempted." In the 2009 season Boise
State, which would finish 14-0, twice ran plays from an A-ll formation.
On an NFL Monday-night game in December '09, the Washington Red-
skins lined up with just a snapper and a nearby flanker in the middle of
the field on an apparent field goal attempt in a game against the New York
Giants. The play led only to an ugly interception, but A-ll devotees across
the country jumped from their seats.
Traditionalists laughed, of course. Football is forever in a state of dy-
namic tension, staunchly resisting change while desperately demanding
it. Every innovation in the history of the game carried risk, challenged
norms and put the creators' jobs at stake. Darrell Royal and Emory Bel-
248

A-ll AND BEYOND
lard would have been laughed out ofAustin if their funky wishbone hadn't
worked. But it did. Bill Walsh would never have become the revered coach
of the champion 49ers if that weird offense of his hadn't panned out in
Cincinnati. But it did.
As you read these words, some sleep-deprived coach in some window-
less room is doodling on a whiteboard or pushing his computer mouse,
trying to come up with something that's never been tried. Some coach is
on the verge of losing his job, desperate enough to try something crazy.
Some coach has just looked at his roster and realized he can't win in the
ordinary way with what he's got. One of these coaches will conjure a vi-
sion and take the leap. And the game of football will change again.

of
2006
Mark
Mravic, the senior editor who
handles the NFL for SPORTS
ILLUSTRATED,
suggested we
write a piece on the ubiquitous Cover Two (or Tampa Two) defense.
I got
the assignment. The story appeared in the Nov. 27, 2006, issue of SI, under
Mravic's headline, Two Tough. It was a good story. People seemed to like hav-
ing America's most popular game explained to them in terms they could un-
derstand. Besides looking at the mechanics of the Cover Two, I had also tried
to explore its lineage: Who started it? Who popularized it? Why did they do
it? What were the stories behind those coaches? People liked that, too.
Not long after the story appeared, I received an e-mail from Jud Laghi,
a literary agent in New York. Jud thought maybe the story could be the
foundation for a book. The idea was instantly appealing to me, and we went
from there. Mravic to Laghi to Layden. That's the creative chain.
The process took more than two years from
first phone call to last
keystroke. I interviewed 145 people, but that number does not tell all, be-
cause in a very real sense the book was informed by every coach or player
I've come across since I first picked up a football in upstate New York.
Dozens of people helped in the completion of this book, including many
at SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, where I've worked for the last 16 years. That list
starts with Terry McDonell, Editor of the Sports Illustrated Group, who
supported the project and gave me the time I needed to finish
it. Execu-
tive editor Mike Bevans has been a friend and confidant since he helped
hire me at Newsday 22 years ago; he offered comforting advice when I was
ready to panic. David Bauer was the book's editor, and there is nobody bet-
ter. He was ably assisted at all times by Stefanie Kaufman, who kept the
project on the rails and tolerated my long silent periods. Kelvin Bias and
Elizabeth McGarr doggedly fact-checked the manuscript, saving me from
251

myself. Jill Jaroff and Kevin Kerr painstakingly copyedited every sentence.
Designer Stephen Skalocky turned my crude X and
drawings into chalk-
board illustrations and Chris Hercik created the cover. Others just listened
to my nonsense and sometimes gave it back, most notably Mark Bechtel,
Steve Cannella and Mark Beech, but also others to whom
I apologize in
advance for absentmindedly leaving out.
SI librarians Joy Birdsong and Natasha Simon helped with research
early in the project, when there was no light, only a tunnel. Peter King,
truly the king of all modern-day NFL writers, a media machine if ever
there was one, was always ready with a phone number or an e-mail when
I needed it, which was often. He is the man.
Over the course of the last 56 years SI has done towering work on the
sport of football, often revealing teams, coaches or players to the public for
the first time. Many of the stories are quoted here, and many others were
read and cataloged. The work of Paul (Dr. Z) Zimmerman is particularly
noteworthy. In the last decade Z has become known for his hard-core foot-
ball analysis and pithy SI.com columns. But for nearly two decades Zimmer-
man turned out a stream of long, thoughtful pieces on some of the central
figures in the game. I read most of them when I was younger and reread
many of them in the last two years.
My good friend Kenny Moore, known to so many as the best chronicler
of track and field and distance running the sport has ever known, wrote
terrific SI pieces on the great Bill Walsh, and on Mouse Davis and Sam
Wyche, as well. I borrowed from all three stories and am thrilled to credit
Kenny accordingly. Rick Telander's 1982 SI story on single wing coach
Keith Piper at Denison University was also very helpful.
The conceit of this book is that across the history of football, certain
men were moved by some flicker of inspiration to change the game. But
some of them lived at the vortex of multiple changes. Hence,
I leaned
heavily on my interviews with the remarkable Don Coryell; with Anthony
Munoz, who was arguably the best offensive lineman in history, but also
a central part of three different revolutionary offensive systems; and Bill
Yeoman, the legendary University of Houston coach.
Just as important to me were several books. Glenn Scobey (Pop) Warner's
Footballfor Coaches & Players, written in 1927, provides eloquent evidence
of Warner's genius in turning the game away from the mass-momentum

scrum of the late 19th century.
It's not an easy read, but any football fan
should make the effort.
Former TCU coach L.R. (Dutch) Meyer's Spread Formation Football,
written in 1952, clearly influenced the generation of coaches that followed
by teaching them to use the entire breadth of the field. Glenn (Tiger) Elli-
son's Run and Shoot Football: Offense of the Future, published in 1965,
reveals the primal roots of the modern wide-open passing game. Ellison
is without question one of the great minds in the history of the game but
is little known and underappreciated. (A valuable aid to my work was a
deeply personal biography of Tiger Ellison written in 2007 by his old-
est daughter, Carolyn J. Ellison, revealing not just a remarkable football
coach, but an educator of extraordinary principle and reach.)
Building a Champion, written by Bill Walsh with Glenn Dickey in 1990,
is an engaging story of the West Coast offense and the 49ers dynasty. It
was an indispensable road map through interviews with several coaches
who learned under Walsh. And I was honored to borrow from the incom-
parable George Plimpton's Paper Lion.
On a fall day in 2008 I returned to my alma mater, Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., where retired football coach Dick Farley, an old and
good friend, sat me down in his office and taught me some football. He
drew formations, filled, then erased, then filled again a whiteboard, and at
the end of our session showed me how he used to jam Lance Alworth at
the line of scrimmage when Dick played for the San Diego Chargers in the
mid-1960s. As a coach, Dick went 114-19-3 (.849) in 17 years at Williams
before retiring in 2003, and many, many players will never forget him. It's
easy to understand why.
In the same fall Dennis Daly gave me a similar tutorial at Westminster
School in Connecticut, and it was so helpful that I'll forgive him for hav-
ing graduated from Amherst.
It would have been impossible to reach many of the primary sources
interviewed for this work if not for the assistance of numerous college
sports information directors and NFL team media-relations officials.

NFL help was provided by Jack Brennan (Bengals), Zack Bolno (Red-

Gleason (Ravens), Bruce Speight (Jets) and Dave Pearson (Seahawks).
Early on, Greg Cosell of NFL Films sat down and took me through
film of the Cover Two. Bill Hofheimer of ESPN helped get me together
with Jon Gruden, who can also sling some serious football knowledge in
a short time and leave any civilian struggling to keep up.
The list of players and coaches interviewed is a long one, and I found
that almost all of them embraced the opportunity to talk about what they
actually do for a living. I called on the following, some for lengthy inter-
views, some for quick thoughts along the way and still others long before
the book began but whose insight was included in some way:

Three of the men who are vital to this book have passed away. I inter-
viewed Jack Neumeier in 1997 about his revolutionary one-back spread
offense (designed for John Elway in high school); he died in 2004. 1 met
Max McGee in 2002 while writing about Paul Hornung; Max died five
years later. Doug Scovil died in 1989, but his ideas still influence offensive
passing systems; his name came up in dozens of my interviews.
My brother, Joe, friend and writer, was just always there.
Most of all, my wife, Janet, tolerated my immersion in this project with
uncommon patience, whether by biting her tongue when I shuffled back
up the stairs to my office after having already spent the entire day there or
by driving on the New York State Thruway to a college cross-country meet
while I transcribed notes in the backseat. Our children, Kristen (the other
Eph in the family) and Kevin (a Rochester Yellowjacket) kept wondering
when the book would be done. Well, it's done now.
