BYUAIRRAID
the arrival in Lubbock of head coach and passing game provocateur Mike
Leach in 2000, the Red Raiders of Texas Tech had used a four-wide shotgun
attack to not only reconfigure the country's offensive statistics but also chal-
lenge longtime bullies Oklahoma and Texas for supremacy in the Big 12.
Behind quarterback Graham Harrell and wideout Michael Crabtree,
Texas Tech won its first 10 games of the '08 season, including an epic
39-33 upset of Texas on the first Saturday night in November. That was
the night football nation first truly understood the miracle that Leach had
wrought in the plains of West Texas. Three weeks later the Raiders' na-
tional title hopes were snatched away by a very good Oklahoma team, but
a statement had already been made. In the land where the wishbone was
invented, where smashmouth football had long been worshipped on Sat-
urday afternoons, a freewheeling, pass-crazy, scoreboard-popping offense
had garnered not only success but also respect.
Texas Tech's invention was really a reinvention. Thirty-two years ear-
lier, and 900 miles from Lubbock, the Cougars of Brigham Young had
begun turning the passing game into an art form, forever altering the
college game. Among the many young coaches watching was Mike Leach.
Brigham Young hired LaVell Edwards as coach in 1972, and before long
he had assembled a staff in Provo perfectly suited to the needs of a pass-

first offense. Norm Chow (who would later tutor Heisman Trophy winners
Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart at USC, as well as Philip Rivers at North
Carolina State) handled receivers and called plays beginning in '82. Roger
French created clever blocking schemes. And Doug Scovil coached quarter-
backs and oversaw the offensive operation from '76 until '80, when the Cou-
gars' quarterbacks were Marc Wilson, Gifford Nielsen and Jim McMahon.
"Doug Scovil put it all together," says Robbie Bosco, who was BYU's
starting quarterback in 1984 and '85 and coached under Edwards for
14 years after finishing his eligibility. "When
I was being recruited [in
'81], Doug had just gotten the head coaching job at San Diego State, so he
was leaving BYU. I went there to visit, and he put his arm around me and
he made it clear to me that it was his offense, and Coach Edwards never
disputed that. Coach Scovil said to me,
cIf you want to be like all those
quarterbacks at BYU, you need to come here.' "
Among other coaches who passed through Provo were Brian Billick,
Mike Holmgren and Andy Reid, all ofwhom would later excel as offensive
coordinators and head coaches in the NFL. And all of them would run
some form of the West Coast offense, making clear that permutations of
the West Coast system were influenced by the Provo think tank. However,
the wide-open spread passing game that Texas Tech had unleashed in
Lubbock was a direct descendant of the offense born in Utah, and it had
come to Mike Leach by way of a coach named Hal Mumme.
In the spring of 1986 Mumme became head coach at Copperas Cove
High in Texas, 70 miles northwest of Austin, in the midst of some of the
best high school football in the country. Mumme was 34 years old and at
last he had his chance to be a head coach. So he would do it his way. "Back
in 1982, when I was the offensive coordinator at UTEP," says Mumme,
"we played BYU, and
I just had tremendous admiration for everything
they did on offense. I decided that if I ever got to be a head coach, I was
going to do what they were doing up there. Some people, when they get
to be a head coach, pick a little from this team and a little from that team.
Not me. I was going to run BYU's stuff."
Mumme put himself on a shuttle between central Texas and north-
ern Utah. "Hal was here

the intricacies of the Cougars' offense. And
it was a thing of beauty.
Consider two of the basic plays:
Scat route In BYU parlance any form of this play was called "scat ball." It
could be run from various formations but always keyed on releasing sev-
eral receivers and a running back and then sending a flanker directly over
the spot from which the ball had been snapped. "That way, says Bosco,
"the quarterback would know exactly where the receiver was going to
be. The short, quick pattern was dubbed a "scat" route. "When we were
playing our best," Bosco says, "we completed that ball probably 90 or 95
percent of the time. And I'm talking over an extended number of years."
Bosco would also see the play on Sundays. "The 49ers," he says, "ran that
play thousands of times." The 49ers called it Flanker Drive, but the execu-
tion was very familiar.
Draw trap An enduring image of the BYU offense is of a steady succession
of passes, followed by a draw play straight up the middle for huge yardage.
"Our best running play, bar none," says Bosco. "Teams would come and
watch us practice the draw trap, but that was our puppy. There were days
when we would rep that play for 20 minutes straight. I'd get tired just from
handing the ball off. But in games, if teams were blitzing us, sometimes I'd
hand the ball off and look back, and I'd think, Man, that's a big hole."
Everything in the offense was run from a spread formation, with wide
line splits. And Hal Mumme loved everything he saw. He took it back to
Copperas Cove, installed it immediately and made a struggling program
much better. "One day," Mumme recalls, "I was sitting in Norm Chow's
office, and he says to me, 'Now, Coach, how do you run four verticals? I
said,
cWe don't run four verticals.' Chow says, 'Coach, if you're not going
to run four verticals, you might as well not use the offense.' So we started
running four verticals. Only we just called it '6.' Because what are you try-
ing to do? You're trying to go get six points."
Mumme created a frenetic practice drill called Routes on Air, in which
five quarterbacks were all throwing passes to five lines of wideouts (instead
of the customary one quarterback throwing to one receiver, with all the oth-
ers standing around waiting their turn). As an added twist, something he
picked up from watching a 49ers practice on a visit west, Mumme would
have every receiver run all the way to the end zone after catching the ball.
He moved up quickly, from Copperas Cove to Iowa Wesleyan to Val-
159

dosta State to Kentucky, where Mumme's system—by then called the Air
Raid—got national exposure. The Wildcats won only 10 Southeastern Con-
ference games in Mumme's four years there but beat LSU twice, scared
everybody else and led the conference in passing for four consecutive
seasons. Florida's Steve Spurrier had shaken the SEC to its conservative
roots in 1990 when he brought his Fun 'n' Gun offense to Gainesville, but
Mumme had taken it a step further with far less talent at his disposal.
At every stop where Mumme coached, one of his top assistants was
Mike Leach, who had been a rugby player at BYU in the early '80s and had
watched the same offense that Mumme so admired; but this was long before
they met. Leach took a circuitous route to Mumme's side, a bizarre trail even
by coaching standards: from BYU to law school at Pepperdine to the U.S.
Sports Academy in Alabama to the College of the Desert in Palm Desert,
Calif., to the European Football League in Finland. But as soon as he got a
taste of the Air Raid offense, he became Mumme's enabler. "He was the guy
who would walk up and down the sideline getting in my ear," says Mumme.
"He was always saying, 'Keep attacking, keep attacking. Stay aggressive.'
When Bob Stoops was hired as Oklahoma's head coach in 1999, he
brought in Leach to run his offense, the first coach to bring the wide-open
offensive philosophy to the Big 12. "Kentucky was hard to play against
when I was at Florida," says Stoops. "I wanted to do that to other people."
Under Leach, Oklahoma averaged nearly 37 points a game in '99, 20 more
than in the previous season. When the Sooners won the national title a
year later, Leach had already left for Texas Tech, where he put together
everything that had been handed down to him—from Dutch Meyer to Ti-
ger Ellison to Mouse Davis to Doug Scovil to Hal Mumme—and turned it
into one of the most eccentric offenses the game has ever seen.
"Frankly," said Mumme in the fall of 2008 as Texas Tech rolled to its
10-0 start, "Mike is doing a better job with this than I ever did."
Leach's career has been fueled by a relentless curiosity, and he's always
let his oddball instincts thrive. One example among many: On a summer
evening in 1989 he was sitting in his apartment in Mount Pleasant, Iowa,
watching NFL videotapes with other Iowa Wesleyan assistant coaches.
Leach became obsessed with the 49ers' "smash" route, a high-low hori-
zontal pass pattern in which two receivers essentially try to confuse a
cornerback, and the quarterback reacts to the confusion.

Leach wanted to know what the indicators are for reading the play,
so he jumped in his car and drove six hours to a Packers minicamp in
Green Bay where he knew the offensive staff were keen to those routes. "I
remember it really well because Tony Mandarich was there," says Leach.
"Anyway, we wound up talking to Lindy Infante about the smash route,
and he said he thought they picked it up from the 49ers, but wasn't sure.
But he explained it, and we put it in at Iowa Wesleyan.
"And here's the thing," says Leach. "We would do the same thing if we
saw a high school team with a good play. We'd go talk to them about it. I
was a young coach, and I was excited about this stuff. Eighty-nine, that
was the summer of love for the spread offense."
The Leach system makes no pretense of conventional balance. His Red
Raiders passed the ball almost twice as often as they ran it. "To me," says
Leach, "balance is making sure all your skill players touch the ball."
Texas Tech's Air Raid (a name co-opted from Mumme with sheer af-
fection) was run out of a one-back set with five receivers.
It advanced
the Mouse and Mumme systems in its complete commitment to the for-
ward pass, with routes based not on timing but rather on a simultaneous
quarterback-receiver read. "Some teams like to go three-step drop and get
rid of it," says Leach. "Our way is to have the receiver find a hole, and we'd
tell him, 'We'll find you in that hole.' "
From Leach's arrival in 2000 through the '08 season (his tenure in
Lubbock would end in discord at the end of the '09 season), Texas Tech
won at least eight games a year with five quarterbacks and averaged more
than 530 yards of offense a game. Perhaps the most telling measure of the
Air Raid's efficiency is that none of those Red Raiders quarterbacks have
been successful in the NFL. They were, in fact, made by the offense.

THE ZONE READ
The blending ofthe modern spreadrunninggame with the venerable read
option is built on this core idea. Theprinciple is the same as that ofthe late- 60s
wishbone: Its easier to reada defenderandrun awayfrom him than it is to
block him. In the spread, though, that read is done behindzone blocking In the
zone readoption, the quarterback lines up in the shotgun with one back next
to him. Upon taking the snap, the QBputs the ball in the belly ofthe running
back and then reads the backside defensive end. IftheDEpinches down and
