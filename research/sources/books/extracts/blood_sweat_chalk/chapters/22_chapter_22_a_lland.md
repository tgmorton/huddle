Chapter 22
A llAND
BEYOND
When two California high school coaches found a
loophole in the rule book, they may have seen the future
met at Humphries' apartment to begin planning the 2007 campaign for
Piedmont High, located in the East Bay hills outside Oakland. It would
prove to be a fateful evening.
Bryan, then 42, was starting the second year of his second tour as head
coach at his alma mater. Humphries, another Piedmont alumnus, whose
father, Michael, had been the Highlanders' freshman coach for decades,
was the director of football operations, in his third year on the staff.
Like so many high school coaches, they shared a passion for a job
they perform tirelessly over long hours and for minimal pay. Bryan had
played at Piedmont in the early '80s, was named offensive coordinator
there in 1987 at age 23 and head coach six seasons later. He does more
than coach football; he's a full-time insurance salesman and a novelist
who has written two football-themed suspense books.
Humphries's route was different—he was a receiver and safety at Pied-
mont, played rugby at Cal, then went first into baseball coaching—but it
landed him back in the game of football at Piedmont. "Sometimes," he
says, "it takes a little while to realize what you love."

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
That doesn't make the job easy. In 2006, Bryan's first season back
on the sideline at Piedmont, the Highlanders went 5-5. They played
conventional football, trying to win physical battles along the line of
scrimmage, establish a running game and tackle well on the other side.
But Piedmont happens to be one of the smaller schools in its confer-
ence, and that means
its players are smaller too. Most are less than
200 pounds. In the first round of the playoffs, the Highlanders played
Miramonte High, a bigger school from nearby Orinda. Piedmont played
well but lost 13-6. That's not what Bryan remembers about the game.
"It was a brutally physical game," recalls Bryan. "We actually played
pretty well, but we just didn't hold up, physically. We'd spent a lot of time
working that game out on paper. We had stuff that should have worked if
we executed. But when it came time to play the game, we just couldn't do
it. We weren't big enough or strong enough. That was very frustrating to
me, and I felt bad for our players."
His story is as old as the game itself. In the end, many football games—
especially at the high school level, where most of the football in America
is played—come down to pure physical superiority.
Take running backs, for example. Says New England Patriots coach
Bill Belichick, "At the lower levels of the game, in high school and some-
times even in college, the best running backs are just faster than every-
body else. They get to the outside, and then they outrun everybody to
the goal." But the same simple formula applies across all positions. A
faster defensive end will beat an offensive tackle to the edge. A huge of-
fensive guard will overwhelm a smaller defensive lineman. And so on.
At the core, every offensive and defensive system ever created was de-
vised for one of two reasons: To enable a physical mismatch to take place
or to avoid being on the wrong end of a physical mismatch. Put another
way: In football, if you are the windshield, you seek out the bug. If you are
the bug, you try to avoid the windshield.
Bryan
felt like the bug.
"I went to Steve's apartment one of those
nights," he says, "and we had books and tapes and whiteboards out. At
one point Steve said to me, 'I want to show you something.' He had this
Emory and Henry-type formation."
(A brief explanation: When Steve Spurrier was coaching a highly suc-
cessful Florida program in the mid- and late-'90s, he occasionally ran
244

A-ll AND BEYOND
plays from a bizarre formation with only three interior linemen and two
sets of three wideouts, not all of whom were eligible receivers. Spurrier
called the formation Emory & Henry, for a small liberal arts college in
southwestern Virginia that had used the formation when he was growing
up in Johnson City, Tenn.)
The Emory & Henry look fascinated Bryan. "A lot of teams have 'light'
formations of some sort," Bryan said. "The Emory and Henry is a light
formation with a lot of vertical passing routes. But
I was wondering if
there might be something more we could do with
it.
I scoured the rule
book for about two days nonstop." And then he found something.
"Kurt put the book in front of me and
said, 'Look at
this,' " says
Humphries. "I give him full credit. He found it."
What Bryan found inside the national high school rule book was the ex-
ception to the scrimmage kick definition, intended for punts, which stipu-
lates that if the player taking the snap from center is at least seven yards
behind the line of scrimmage (slightly farther than a conventional shotgun
snap), then the usual uniform-number rules do not apply (i.e., the rule that
at least five players must wear "lineman numbers" 50 through 79).
Thus, Bryan realized, as long as the quarterback sets up in a deep
shotgun, a team could legally break the huddle with 11 players wearing
uniform numbers which allowed them to line up as eligible receivers.
Once lined up, some players would be rendered ineligible by formation,
but until the formation was set, any offensive player on the field repre-
sented an eligible pass receiver.
While the rule was clearly written for the punting game, Bryan envi-
sioned something else altogether—a scrimmage scheme in which every
player in the huddle was an offensive threat and the entire field was in play.
The confusion it would obviously create for the defense was tantalizing.
"Pretty unique idea," says Humphries.
The two coaches decided that night to implement the offense, which
they would call the A-ll, because
"all 11" players are potentially eligible.
Its root concept was not out of line with current trends at other levels of
football—spread offenses were overtaking the college game and evolved
passing games and offense-friendly rules changes (the five-yard no-chuck
rule, among others) were altering the NFL. For Bryan and Humphries, the
operative word was space, and they were taking that concept to its extreme.
245

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
They conceived a playbook in which the base formation was Emory &
Henry—a center flanked by two "guards," a quarterback in shotgun with
a running back nearby and two "bunches" of three wide receivers on each
side of the field. All 11 of these players wore the jersey numbers of eligible
receivers, meaning, again, that when they broke the huddle any of them
could legally catch a pass.
Football rules, however, mandate that even in "scrimmage kick for-
mation," seven players must be on the line of scrimmage when the ball is
snapped, with four players in the backfield. Of the seven on the line, only
the two on the outside (the "ends") are eligible to run downfield and re-
ceive a pass, along with three of the four backs, excluding the passer.
Yet, because the A-ll breaks the huddle with 11 potential receivers
and relies on last-second shifts before revealing the final alignment of
the formation, the defense is challenged to quickly identify the eligible
receivers on any given play. The offense was instantly successful; Pied-
mont went 7-4 in 2007 and 8-3 in 2008. Defenses were predictably
befuddled, and Piedmont piled up points.
More
surprising
were
two
other
developments.
According
to
Humphries, despite their offense having the appearance of Ultimate Fris-
bee, Piedmont had a nearly 50-50 split between the run and the pass.
Much like the one-back spread offense from the 1980s, the spread A-ll
opened up massive running lanes for ballcarriers.
Secondly, says Humphries, "we had hardly any injuries." Intuitively, this
would seem to owe to a reduction of fierce interior line battles. However,
the offense also leads to more open-field tackles, and open-field tackling
produces high-speed collisions. Despite the paradox, the evidence of fewer
injuries in the A-ll made the offense worthy of consideration at a time when
football is racked by injury concerns, particularly head trauma.
Instead, the offense was nearly killed.
Indianapolis, Ind.
February 2009
PIEDMONT'S A-ll generated intense interest. The New York Times and
ESPN were among the many media outlets that seized upon its quirky
genius and made countercultural football celebrities out of Bryan and
246

A-ll AND BEYOND
Humphries. Scientific American, in a relentlessly quoted article, calculated
that the A-ll had 16,632 possible postsnap play possibilities, whereas con-
ventional formations had only 36.
On a rainy fall Saturday at the time, a Connecticut high school coach
named Deron Bayer, whose team was running the single wing, pulled a
writer aside and began sketching the A-ll. "This
is the next thing," he
said, almost conspiratorially. "We might use it next year. All our big guys
are graduating."
Hundreds of other high school coaches were thinking the same thing.
Bryan and Humphries said they had to change their cellphone numbers
because so many coaches were calling, seeking holy water for their pro-
grams. But there was another side to the story. As much cheerleading as
there was for the novel attack, there was also vehement criticism.
The college football rule offered only a more restrictive scrimmage
kick option and the NFL has no such rule. Since there was no obvious A-ll
loophole to exploit at those levels, detractors said that this renegade of-
fense had no place in the higher strata of football. The Piedmont geniuses
were accused of corrupting the spirit of the game by contorting what is
clearly designed as an old punt rule to enable more players to run down
the field in passing routes as an every-down offense.
Technically, the
critics were
right:
That's
exactly what Bryan and
Humphries were doing. But that doesn't mean it wasn't good for football
to be exposed to such radical thinking. After
all,
if Pop Warner hadn't
thought up the single wing, football might have died before 1910, the vic-
tim of too much violence.
However, the National Federation of State High School Associations,
the organization responsible for the rule book, didn't see it that way. In
February 2009, the NFHS changed the scrimmage kick formation rule,
mandating that only the center—the long snapper—could wear an eligible
jersey number (though, at the center position, he would be ineligible),
while the other four interior linemen must wear jersey numbers from 50
to 79. Word rippled through the football world: THE A-ll IS DEAD.
But not to Bryan and Humphries. "All [the Federation] did " says Bry-
an, "is make it so that you can't throw a forward pass to those guys. But
those guys can still throw a pass. They can still take a handoff. They can
receive a pass thrown backward? So for the 2009 season the two men got
247

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
even more crafty. "And the offense, if anything," says Humphries, "got
even more deadly."
So, undaunted, the two coaches created a new term: anchors. In their
new version of the A-ll, the anchors are the "linemen" assigned to wear
jersey numbers from 50 to 79. But they are not linemen in the traditional
sense. Often they are hybrid athletes capable of playing several positions.
On Sept. 8, Oakland Tribune columnist Carl Steward covered the first
Piedmont game of what was supposed to be the post-A-11 era and wrote
the following sentence with considerable wonder: "On the Highlanders'
second play of the 2009 season Friday night against Drake of San Ansel-
mo, a Piedmont player wearing No. 77, George Fullerton, took an end-
around from quarterback Cormac Craigie for a seven-yard gain, out of a
Statue of Liberty handoff."
Bryan explains: "Just think about
it. Just because a guy is wearing
number 68, doesn't mean he can't be a fast, explosive player. Think of a
4.4 [40-yard dash] guy in that anchor position, who can receive a lateral."
Under the new rules, Bryan and Humphries could no longer present to the
defense 11 potential receivers coming out of the huddle. But they would
continue to move players into positions and roles not normally associ-
ated with their jersey numbers. And they would still use myriad forma-
tions and shifts. "This year I think we had 331 different formations," says
Humphries. "Before the rule changed, we had 232. All it did was push us
to be more creative and push out even more new formations."
The offense began to seep into other levels of football. As
it turned
out, the college rule book does, in effect, allow an A-ll-type offense when
"it is obvious that a kick may be attempted." In the 2009 season Boise
State, which would finish 14-0, twice ran plays from an A-ll formation.
On an NFL Monday-night game in December '09, the Washington Red-
skins lined up with just a snapper and a nearby flanker in the middle of
the field on an apparent field goal attempt in a game against the New York
Giants. The play led only to an ugly interception, but A-ll devotees across
the country jumped from their seats.
Traditionalists laughed, of course. Football is forever in a state of dy-
namic tension, staunchly resisting change while desperately demanding
it. Every innovation in the history of the game carried risk, challenged
norms and put the creators' jobs at stake. Darrell Royal and Emory Bel-
248

A-ll AND BEYOND
lard would have been laughed out ofAustin if their funky wishbone hadn't
worked. But it did. Bill Walsh would never have become the revered coach
of the champion 49ers if that weird offense of his hadn't panned out in
Cincinnati. But it did.
As you read these words, some sleep-deprived coach in some window-
less room is doodling on a whiteboard or pushing his computer mouse,
trying to come up with something that's never been tried. Some coach is
on the verge of losing his job, desperate enough to try something crazy.
Some coach has just looked at his roster and realized he can't win in the
ordinary way with what he's got. One of these coaches will conjure a vi-
sion and take the leap. And the game of football will change again.

N THE
fall
of
2006
Mark
Mravic, the senior editor who
handles the NFL for SPORTS
ILLUSTRATED,
suggested we
write a piece on the ubiquitous Cover Two (or Tampa Two) defense.
I got
the assignment. The story appeared in the Nov. 27, 2006, issue of SI, under
Mravic's headline, Two Tough. It was a good story. People seemed to like hav-
ing America's most popular game explained to them in terms they could un-
derstand. Besides looking at the mechanics of the Cover Two, I had also tried
to explore its lineage: Who started it? Who popularized it? Why did they do
it? What were the stories behind those coaches? People liked that, too.
Not long after the story appeared, I received an e-mail from Jud Laghi,
a literary agent in New York. Jud thought maybe the story could be the
foundation for a book. The idea was instantly appealing to me, and we went
from there. Mravic to Laghi to Layden. That's the creative chain.
The process took more than two years from
first phone call to last
keystroke. I interviewed 145 people, but that number does not tell all, be-
cause in a very real sense the book was informed by every coach or player
I've come across since I first picked up a football in upstate New York.
Dozens of people helped in the completion of this book, including many
at SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, where I've worked for the last 16 years. That list
starts with Terry McDonell, Editor of the Sports Illustrated Group, who
supported the project and gave me the time I needed to finish
it. Execu-
tive editor Mike Bevans has been a friend and confidant since he helped
hire me at Newsday 22 years ago; he offered comforting advice when I was
ready to panic. David Bauer was the book's editor, and there is nobody bet-
ter. He was ably assisted at all times by Stefanie Kaufman, who kept the
project on the rails and tolerated my long silent periods. Kelvin Bias and
Elizabeth McGarr doggedly fact-checked the manuscript, saving me from
251

myself. Jill Jaroff and Kevin Kerr painstakingly copyedited every sentence.
Designer Stephen Skalocky turned my crude X and
drawings into chalk-
board illustrations and Chris Hercik created the cover. Others just listened
to my nonsense and sometimes gave it back, most notably Mark Bechtel,
Steve Cannella and Mark Beech, but also others to whom
I apologize in
advance for absentmindedly leaving out.
SI librarians Joy Birdsong and Natasha Simon helped with research
early in the project, when there was no light, only a tunnel. Peter King,
truly the king of all modern-day NFL writers, a media machine if ever
there was one, was always ready with a phone number or an e-mail when
I needed it, which was often. He is the man.
Over the course of the last 56 years SI has done towering work on the
sport of football, often revealing teams, coaches or players to the public for
the first time. Many of the stories are quoted here, and many others were
read and cataloged. The work of Paul (Dr. Z) Zimmerman is particularly
noteworthy. In the last decade Z has become known for his hard-core foot-
ball analysis and pithy SI.com columns. But for nearly two decades Zimmer-
man turned out a stream of long, thoughtful pieces on some of the central
figures in the game. I read most of them when I was younger and reread
many of them in the last two years.
My good friend Kenny Moore, known to so many as the best chronicler
of track and field and distance running the sport has ever known, wrote
terrific SI pieces on the great Bill Walsh, and on Mouse Davis and Sam
Wyche, as well. I borrowed from all three stories and am thrilled to credit
Kenny accordingly. Rick Telander's 1982 SI story on single wing coach
Keith Piper at Denison University was also very helpful.
The conceit of this book is that across the history of football, certain
men were moved by some flicker of inspiration to change the game. But
some of them lived at the vortex of multiple changes. Hence,
I leaned
heavily on my interviews with the remarkable Don Coryell; with Anthony
Munoz, who was arguably the best offensive lineman in history, but also
a central part of three different revolutionary offensive systems; and Bill
Yeoman, the legendary University of Houston coach.
Just as important to me were several books. Glenn Scobey (Pop) Warner's
Footballfor Coaches & Players, written in 1927, provides eloquent evidence
of Warner's genius in turning the game away from the mass-momentum

scrum of the late 19th century.
It's not an easy read, but any football fan
should make the effort.
Former TCU coach L.R. (Dutch) Meyer's Spread Formation Football,
written in 1952, clearly influenced the generation of coaches that followed
by teaching them to use the entire breadth of the field. Glenn (Tiger) Elli-
son's Run and Shoot Football: Offense of the Future, published in 1965,
reveals the primal roots of the modern wide-open passing game. Ellison
is without question one of the great minds in the history of the game but
is little known and underappreciated. (A valuable aid to my work was a
deeply personal biography of Tiger Ellison written in 2007 by his old-
est daughter, Carolyn J. Ellison, revealing not just a remarkable football
coach, but an educator of extraordinary principle and reach.)
Building a Champion, written by Bill Walsh with Glenn Dickey in 1990,
is an engaging story of the West Coast offense and the 49ers dynasty. It
was an indispensable road map through interviews with several coaches
who learned under Walsh. And I was honored to borrow from the incom-
parable George Plimpton's Paper Lion.
On a fall day in 2008 I returned to my alma mater, Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., where retired football coach Dick Farley, an old and
good friend, sat me down in his office and taught me some football. He
drew formations, filled, then erased, then filled again a whiteboard, and at
the end of our session showed me how he used to jam Lance Alworth at
the line of scrimmage when Dick played for the San Diego Chargers in the
mid-1960s. As a coach, Dick went 114-19-3 (.849) in 17 years at Williams
before retiring in 2003, and many, many players will never forget him. It's
easy to understand why.
In the same fall Dennis Daly gave me a similar tutorial at Westminster
School in Connecticut, and it was so helpful that I'll forgive him for hav-
ing graduated from Amherst.
It would have been impossible to reach many of the primary sources
interviewed for this work if not for the assistance of numerous college
sports information directors and NFL team media-relations officials.
College contacts included: John Bianco and Bill Little (Texas), Wade
Branner (Virginia Military Institute), Dean Buchan (Georgia Tech), Mark
Brand (Arizona
State), Art Chase (Duke), Mark Cohen (TCU), Chris
Cook (Texas Tech), Tina Dechausay (Florida State), Steve Fink (South

sity), Craig Sachson (Princeton), Scott Selheimer (Delaware), Tim Tes-
salone (USC), Don Tomkalski (Tulsa), Tom Schott (Purdue) and Shelley
Poe (at Ohio State).
NFL help was provided by Jack Brennan (Bengals), Zack Bolno (Red-
skins), Derek Boyko (Eagles), Jim Christman (Bears), Rich Dalrymple
(Cowboys), Mark Dalton (Cardinals), Harvey Greene (Dolphins), Stacey
James and Berj Najarian (Patriots), Bill Johnston (Chargers), Jeff Kamis
(Buccaneers), Craig Kelley (Colts), Burt Lauten and Dave Lockett (Steel-
ers), Pete Moris (Chiefs), Rick Smith (Rams), Chad Steele and Patrick
Gleason (Ravens), Bruce Speight (Jets) and Dave Pearson (Seahawks).
Early on, Greg Cosell of NFL Films sat down and took me through
film of the Cover Two. Bill Hofheimer of ESPN helped get me together
with Jon Gruden, who can also sling some serious football knowledge in
a short time and leave any civilian struggling to keep up.
The list of players and coaches interviewed is a long one, and I found
that almost all of them embraced the opportunity to talk about what they
actually do for a living. I called on the following, some for lengthy inter-
views, some for quick thoughts along the way and still others long before
the book began but whose insight was included in some way:

Three of the men who are vital to this book have passed away. I inter-
viewed Jack Neumeier in 1997 about his revolutionary one-back spread
offense (designed for John Elway in high school); he died in 2004. 1 met
Max McGee in 2002 while writing about Paul Hornung; Max died five
years later. Doug Scovil died in 1989, but his ideas still influence offensive
passing systems; his name came up in dozens of my interviews.
My brother, Joe, friend and writer, was just always there.
Most of all, my wife, Janet, tolerated my immersion in this project with
uncommon patience, whether by biting her tongue when I shuffled back
up the stairs to my office after having already spent the entire day there or
by driving on the New York State Thruway to a college cross-country meet
while I transcribed notes in the backseat. Our children, Kristen (the other
Eph in the family) and Kevin (a Rochester Yellowjacket) kept wondering
when the book would be done. Well, it's done now.
