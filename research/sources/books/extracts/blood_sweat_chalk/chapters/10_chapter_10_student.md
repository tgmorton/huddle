have come a long way.
Once upon a time they
were gyms with
offices
tucked into dark corners, or field houses with offices stuck somewhere
behind the bleachers, and you had to work hard just to find the coach.
Gradually they have become, of course, something much more, giant pal-
aces erected in homage to the money of some alumnus. They have elabo-
rate workout rooms and shiny office suites overlooking the field.
USC's Heritage Hall is something altogether different. It is not a pal-
ace, because it is not new or vast or opulent. But it is a shrine, and that
is apparent from the seven Heisman Trophies on display, under glass, in
the first-floor lobby. In Heritage Hall—even the name is instructive—it
is impossible to forget who has trod the floor beneath your feet.
On this day, USC coach John Robinson, who will turn 60 at the end of
the following month, is sitting in a meeting room on the second floor of
the building. Robinson is beginning the third year of his second tour as
coach of the Trojans. (The first was from 1976 through '82; this second
run would last from '93 through '97.) He is sitting in darkness, his profile
illuminated by an overhead projector that spins out past Trojan glory,
much of it orchestrated by Robinson.

The viewing isn't Robinson's idea. "I don't spend a lot of time remi-
niscing," he says. But once the show begins, he assumes a coach's pose:
loafers on the table, remote control resting in the palm of his right hand
with his thumb at the ready.
On the screen there is an image of the late Ricky Bell, who played for
USC from 1973 through '76 and was the starting tailback on Robinson's
first team as head coach. The narrator on the film intones, "One of the
highlights ofRobinson'sfirstyear in '76 was the play ofsenior tailback Ricky
Belir He gained 1,433 yards that year and scored 14 touchdowns as the
Trojans went 11-1.
"Great player, collision runner like Earl Campbell," says Robinson. His
voice cracks slightly. Bell died of sudden heart failure in 1984; he was
only 29 years old. "This guy was a great kid," says Robinson. "A big-time
human being."
Now the screen is lit with action of the 1980 Rose Bowl, in which No. 3
USC beat No. 1 Ohio State 17-16. Narrator: "USC trailed undefeated Ohio
State in thefinal minutes and then began one of the most devastating victory
drives in the history of the Rose Bowl

"I told Paul Hackett, our offensive coordinator, 'Give the ball to Charlie
White and run behind Anthony Munoz,' " says Robinson. "Munoz was a
senior, played the first three plays of the first game of the season and got
hurt. He came to me in December and said, 'Should I play in the Rose
Bowl or redshirt?' I told him he really should play, and if he plays well,
he'll get drafted anyway. Hell, he was the third guy picked in the whole
draft. Charlie White broke his nose in that game, blood all over his face.
Toughest player I've ever been around. His fullback was Marcus Allen.
One hundred eighty-five pounds."
The show goes on for nearly an hour. Highlight films like this have a
way of making the ordinary seem extraordinary. But the USC production
that Robinson is watching is a true cavalcade of greatness. Sam Cunning-
ham, Charlie Young, Lynn Swann, Anthony Davis, Pat Haden, Bell, Mar-
vin Powell, Clay Matthews, Paul McDonald, Munoz, White, Allen, Ronnie
Lott, Dennis Smith—it's like a football fantasy camp. Robinson coached
all of them, either as an assistant (1972-74) or head coach, before moving
to the NFL for nine years as coach of the Rams.
The flow of talent running through USC during the Robinson years
118

STUDENT BODY RIGHT
was unprecedented in the college game. "Big man on big man" is what
renowned former USC assistant Marv Goux would call the Trojans' prac-
tices. "We has so much talent and we played so hard during the week,"
recalls former tight end Charlie Young, "our practices were harder than
the games." Through all those years there was a relentless, punishing of-
fensive system built on foundation plays that became known throughout
the college game as student body right and student body left. They were
power sweeps run with mammoth linemen leading fast, tough tailbacks
out of the
I formation; they were descendants of the Green Bay pow-
er sweep but operated by a generation of better athletes, most of whom
would also wind up in the NFL.
The modern running game began with Lombardi, who was the first to
take the ancient principles of the single wing and modernize them. But
coach after coach after coach will tell you that the next link in the chain
of innovation was the USC power game, which would later become the
Los Angeles Rams' power game. And it started well before John Robinson
got to Southern California.

Summer 1956
BOBBY BOWDEN was 26 years old when he signed on as coach of football,
basketball and baseball at South Georgia College. Hedging against the
possibility that he might not be busy enough, Bowden was also the athlet-
ic director. But his future lay in football, and he knew it. And he also knew
he needed an offense. The closest major university was 126 miles south-
west in Tallahassee, where Tom Nugent was about to begin his fourth
year as coach at Florida State. Bowden and his assistant coach, Vince
Gibson (who would later be the head coach at Kansas State, Louisville
and Tulane), piled into a car and went to see Nugent—because Nugent, a
known football innovator, had something they wanted to see.
When Nugent had taken over as coach at Virginia Military Institute in
1949, the predominant offensive attack in college football (and, indeed,
in professional football as well) was the T formation. Nugent was looking
for something different to run. He designed a formation in which all three
backs lined up directly behind the quarterback, in a single line, perpen-
119

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
dicular to the line of scrimmage. Just as the T formation was named for
its appearance, so was this: the I.
Nugent did not run the
I in his inaugural season; that would begin
in 1950. In his history of VMI
athletics, The Corps Roots the Loudest,
Thomas W. Davis writes:
Nugent's second season was one of the most unusual in VMFs gridiron
history. It started with a high note of success, a 25-19 night game win
over William and Mary in Roanoke, the first loss by [William and Mary]
to a Virginia team in 10 years; a contributing factor was Nugent's unveil-
ing of the I formation, its first use in college football.
Later, Davis writes, "Tom Nugent's third season resulted in a 7-3
record and a Southern Conference championship that VMI shared that
year with the University of Maryland. Using their coach's
I formation
with great success, VMI's offense averaged 28 points in each of the sev-
en wins." Nugent stayed one more season before taking his offense to
Florida State.
BOWDEN, BEFORE his arrival at South Georgia, had been an assistant at
Howard College (now Samford) in Birmingham, his hometown. "We ran
the dead, straight T formation at Howard," says Bowden. "We didn't split
anybody out. But I wanted to see what Tom Nugent was running at Florida
State. Well, he was running the pure I formation, with all four backs, in-
cluding the quarterback, in a straight line. Tom gave us the playbook. I still
remember it today. The off-tackle play was called the Blast. The outside play
was called the Roll. And they had a play action pass off both of them."
The I formation was a power offense with slightly more deception than
the T. With the I, offenses could run a power play off tackle by sending the
lead back one way for a fake and still have a back as lead blocker at the
point of attack. "Back in those days," says Bowden in his familiar drawl,
"there wasn't a whole lot of imagination."
Bowden ran the I formation for three years at South Georgia, and when
he went back to Howard/Samford as the head coach in 1959, he switched
to the wing T. But by the time he landed in West Virginia in '66, he was
running a pro-set I formation, with two backs behind the quarterback. It
would remain the foundation of the Bowden offense for more than three
120

STUDENT BODY RIGHT
decades and was called the multiple I. And to this day Bowden says, "You
never can tell who invented anything, but it wouldn't surprise me if Tom
Nugent invented that thing."
AT THE same time Bowden was visiting Nugent, a continent away Don
Coryell, athletic director and football coach at Fort Ord, a U.S. Army base
near the Monterey Peninsula, was tweaking the two-man I formation for
the 1956 season that he had used with success at Wenatchee Valley Col-
lege the year before.
After his one season at Fort Ord, Coryell ran the I formation for three
years at Whittier College, then went to USC as an assistant coach under
John McKay in I960. USC history generally credits McKay with installing
the power offense that would eventually become student body right, and
clearly he deserves much of the credit. Says Robinson, "There's no doubt
McKay was the guy who developed the USC offense in that era. But he
talked to a lot of people about it. I always heard there was a high school
coach somewhere in L.A. who was running the I formation offense. And
Don Coryell was somebody that McKay talked to a lot."
Once committed, McKay went all in on the power I. Willie Brown be-
came the first in a long line of brilliant, durable USC tailbacks. In McKay's
third year Brown rushed for 574 yards on just 88 carries, and USC went
10-0 in the regular season, beat Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl and won its
first national championship since 1939. The Trojans would win four more
in the next 16 years.
Robinson explains the USC power philosophy in all its breathtaking
simplicity. "Number 1," he says, "you were going to have a tailback that
you really featured. McKay wanted to develop one player who really dom-
inated the scene. You were going to give him the ball 30 times a game.
Hell, I gave it to Ricky 53 times in one game. People wanted to kill me."
(Actually Bell carried only 51 times, for 347 yards in a 23-14 win over
Washington State in 1976.)
"Then," Robinson continues, "McKay worked really hard on getting
the best offensive linemen, and really physical offensive linemen. The
goal was to physically dominate the defense, control the line of scrim-
mage and feature the tailback. Beyond that, we wanted a smart quar-
terback who could manage the game and throw individual routes when
121

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
defenses singled the wide receivers. That was Pat Haden, Paul McDonald."
The USC power offense was clearly informed by Lombardi's power
sweep. The Trojan and Packer offenses were similar in that both aspired to
get two solid blocks (in most cases the tight end and play-side tackle) on the
front side of an outside play and attack the edge of the defense. But McKay
and USC refined the play in two important ways. First, where Lombardi's
sweep began with a handoff from the quarterback to a halfback running
across the back of the formation from behind the backside guard-tackle
gap, student body right began with a quick toss from the quarterback to the
tailback, who lined up directly behind the quarterback.
"It hit faster than the Green Bay sweep," says Robinson. "By the quar-
terback flipping the ball to the tailback, who was already running to the
outside, we got the tailback outside much faster than Lombardi did. But it
was similar to the Green Bay sweep in concept, in that it broke sideways,
turned upfield and tried to ram the ball down your throat."
Second, while the USC sweep, like the Green Bay sweep, pulled both
guards (and sometimes the backside tackle), the blocking scheme was al-
tered. Says Robinson, "The backside pullers didn't attempt to get in front
of the tailback. Only the onside guard got in front." In truth, the USC
sweep was too fast-hitting for both guards to get out ahead of the tailback.
The backside guard instead picked off backside chasers.
And while the toss sweep was to become the most famous of USC's
power running plays, it was but one of four base calls. The others were
isolation (or, in coachspeak, iso\ power strong and power weak. On the
isolation call, the tailback ran straight over the middle of the offensive
line, with a double-team block on the nose and the fullback leading. Pow-
er strong was an off-tackle play to the tight end side, and power weak
had a fullback leading the play away from the tight end side. "It was an
offense that you could draw up real simply," says Munoz. "But it required
real tough, effective man-to-man blocking by the tackle and the tight end
on the play side."
In 1965 Mike Garrett won the Heisman Trophy running behind sopho-
more offensive tackle Ron Yary, who two years later would win the Out-
land Trophy and eventually become an All-Pro with the Vikings. Five
years later, in '70, McKay took the Trojans to Alabama to play Bear Bry-
ant's Crimson Tide at Legion Field in Alabama. Rare is the game that be-
122

STUDENT BODY RIGHT
comes an implement of social change, but not long after USC sophomore
Sam Cunningham trampled Alabama for 135 yards, Bryant began to plead
with his university to integrate the program.
Eight years later, under Robinson, the Trojans went to Birmingham
again, this time with an offensive line that included Munoz and Keith Van
Home as the tackles, Brad Budde at one of the guard positions and Hoby
Brenner at tight end. Charles White was the tailback, and blocking for
him was an undersized freshman stud, who Robinson just had to get on
the field somewhere—Marcus Allen. It was one of the most talent-stuffed
college football teams in the game's long history. The Trojans beat the
Tide 24-14, and nothing better illustrated USC's power game than Van
Home's dominance of Alabama defensive tackle Marty Lyons. "All we
heard all week was what a tough matchup it was going to be for Keith
against Marty Lyons," says Munoz. "Well,
I can say to this day is that
Keith did an outstanding job."
Robinson left USC after the 1982 season to take over the Rams. "We
brought a lot of the same stuff to the Rams that we had been running
at USC," he says. As at USC, Robinson developed offensive linemen and
a featured tailback, in this case a 6' 3", 220-pound blend of speed and
power named Eric Dickerson, who entered the NFL the same year Robin-
son did and rushed for nearly 7,000 yards in his first four seasons. He ran
behind the likes of right tackle Jackie Slater, who would land in the Hall
of Fame, and six-time Pro Bowl center Doug Smith, who made the L.A.
power series hum. But by the end of the '80s, the Rams were learning a
different system altogether. It was called zone blocking.

OUTSIDE ZONE RIGHT
In zone blockingschemes, offensive linemen attempt to use the speedandpursuit
ofthe defense against itselfEach offensive lineman, insteadoffiringforward
andblocking the defender directly infront ofhim, slides in one direction,
together with the others— "like on a railroad track,"asAnthony Munoz
describes it. In an outside zone scheme, as the defenders chase theplay, the
offensive linemen use thatmomentum to carry themfarther outside, spreading
them, which opens running lanes. The quarterback takes the snap andruns
wide to make a direct handoffto the tailback. Once the TB receives the ball, he
reads thegaps in the defense and cuts upfieldwhen he sees an opening.
