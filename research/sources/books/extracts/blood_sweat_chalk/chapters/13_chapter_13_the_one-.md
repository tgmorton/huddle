THE ONE-
BACK SPREAD
An L.A. high school coach took a chance and launched
an offense— andJohn Elway and Drew Brees with it
and they speak a language that nobody else really understands.
It
is
their way of finding normalcy. But it's also a way of staying in the endless
loop of innovation. Friends do not hide discoveries from each other.
In the spring of 1979 Joe Tiller and Jack Elway met up at a bar not
far from the campus of San Jose State University, where Elway, then
47 years old, had recently been named football coach. Though 11 years
apart in age, the two had become tight while working together in the
early '70s on coach Jim Sweeney's staff at Washington State; Elway
had gone on to a stop at Cal State-Northridge, Tiller took on a three-
year stint as an defensive line coach for the Calgary Stampeders of
the Canadian Football League and now was Calgary's assistant gen-
eral manager. He was scouting college players in California, and that
meant his trip to San Jose was a business expense, no small matter in
those days.
"First thing I do is go watch Jack's team practice," recalls Tiller (who
retired following the 2008 season after 12 seasons as a head coach at
Purdue). "And he's got guys spread all over the place on offense. Now,

when Jack and I had coached together at Washington State, we were
a splitback veer team, triple option football, like a lot of teams were
playing then. All of a sudden Jack is doing this one-back offense with
people spread out all across the field.
"So after practice Jack and I went out for a couple of pops for me-
dicinal purposes," Tiller says. "Someplace near the campus. Naturally,
we're talking about football because that's what football coaches do.
And
I always thought Jack had a great football mind, so I'm curious
about what I saw his team doing in practice when I'd been there. I say
'Jack, I'm really intrigued by what you're doing here. Where did you
learn this stuff?'
Elway had to be thinking that was a pretty funny question. The
answer was something that Tiller couldn't have expected. "This is the
stuff that John ran in high school," Elway told his friend. "I talked with
John's coach a couple of years ago, and I decided this stuff might work
at the college level. So I put it in."
Their conversation echoed one that Elway had had two years earlier
when he'd gotten a phone call from Mike Price, who had also worked
with Elway at Washington State and was still an assistant there. Price
asked Elway what he was running. "Never mind what I'm doing," El-
way said. "You should see the stuff my son is running. They're killing
people, just killing 'em. I'm putting this stuff in next year."
John Elway, future Super Bowl winner and Hall of Fame quarter-
back with the Denver Broncos, was running a spread-out, pass-happy
offense at Granada Hills High in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley. His coach
was Jack Neumeier.
Neumeier was from the same generation as Tiger Ellison, a tough,
old school football man. "Jack was a three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust
guy," says Darryl Stroh, who was introduced to the coaching business
by Neumeier in I960, his first year at Granada Hills. "He was tough on
kids. He believed in being tough on kids."
Stroh recalls a practice in which two Granada Hills players started
fighting each other while still clad in full equipment. Neumeier whis-
tled the scrap to a halt and then ordered the team to stand in a circle
while the two combatants stripped off their helmets and pads before
continuing with the fight. "Once kids realized they were going to have
150

THE ONE-BACK SPREAD
to settle their fights without pads and helmets," says Stroh, "we had a
lot fewer fights."
Neumeier's strategic turning point came in 1969, when Granada
Hills lost two close, low-scoring games in the regular season and failed
to make the Los Angeles city playoffs. Granada Hills had a terrific de-
fense and a steady offense, but that wasn't enough. Failure tore at
Neumeier. "Jack was about ready to hang himself after that year, he
was so distraught," says Stroh.
There would be a radical change. In the summer before the 1970
season Neumeier called a meeting with his returning starting quarter-
back, Dana Potter. "He told me he'd read a book by some high school
coach in Ohio," says Potter. (That book was almost certainly Tiger El-
lison's handbook on the run-and-shoot.)
"He said we were going to throw 35 passes a game. I had a hard time
imagining that happening because at that time nobody was throw-
ing the ball in Southern California. But sure enough, when the season
started, we were throwing it like crazy. We were starting games in the
two-minute drill. After a while we didn't even bother to look at film of
the other team's defense."
Granada Hills won the city title with the wide-open spread game in
1970, and six years later John Elway arrived as a tall, skinny running
back and switched positions. He would one day tell The Denver Post,
"[Neumeier] was the guy who made me fall in love with football at the
quarterback position."
Where Neumeier had once stressed physical dominance, he now
became a tireless student of the passing game. In a 1990 interview
with the Los Angeles Times, Neumeier explained his system: "Basical-
ly, my offense spreads the defense across the field," he said. "A lot of
teams will spread the defense the depth of the field, like the Raiders
for instance, but my idea is to spread them from sideline to sideline so
you never get two defensive backs to cover one receiver. And when you
catch the defense in a one-on-one, the receiver would go to an open
spot and should get there before the defender because he knows where
he's going."
Neumeier taught the system not only to John Elway but to Elway's
father and to a coach named Dennis Erickson. During his time at
151

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Granada Hills, Neumeier lived with his family in a house overlooking
the San Fernando Valley. "So many times I would go up there to visit
him," says Potter. "And he would be just sitting in the den, in the dark.
His wife would let me in the house, and I'd walk into the den, and Jack
would flip on the light and say,
C
I was just thinking about something
with the offense.'
Neumeier was gravely ill with cancer when he attended John Elway's
Hall of Fame induction on Aug. 8, 2004. "Jack was on his last legs, but
on that trip he just came to life talking about football and memories,"
says Stroh. Less than a month later, on Sept. 1, 2004, Neumeier died at
the age of 85. His football legacy would outlive him by decades.
The meeting at the bar between Tiller and Elway happened almost
20 years after Tiger Ellison had begun spreading the field in southwest
Ohio but not long after Mouse Davis had installed the run-and-shoot
at Portland State. The offenses were not identical: Neumeier's package
often used a tight end, Davis's did not. But their systems unquestion-
ably shared central themes influential to this day: Spread out the de-
fense. Get favorable matchups in coverage. Create running lanes. Get
the chalk last.
In five years at San Jose State, Jack Elway went 35-20-1, including
three wins over nearby rival Stanford. But it was one of his assistants,
Erickson, who would take Neumeier's offense nationwide. Erickson
had been a feisty three-year starter at quarterback at Montana State
(under the same Jim Sweeney, who would later mentor Elway, Price
and Tiller
at Washington
State). Erickson joined Elway's San Jose
State staff in 1979; a decade later he had won the first of two national
championships at Miami.
On his way to Miami, Erickson took his offense—which came to
be known as the "one-back spread" to Idaho and then to Wyoming.
"There was a time when everybody was running the 'bone, and so
people in Wyoming were happy with
it," says Joe Tiller, who came
to Laramie to work as an assistant in '87. "But Dennis came in and
threw the ball all over the place, and people loved it." Erickson left for
Washington State after just one season, but his offense he had brought
stayed in place; when Tiller became head coach at Wyoming in '91, he
did nothing to change it.

THE ONE-BACK SPREAD
"I had no choice; they loved what Dennis had done," Tiller says.
"People have asked me for years how I learned this offense. I tell them,
'Dennis left his playbook at Wyoming.' And that's absolutely the truth."
At Washington State, Erickson turned the Cougars around from 3-7-1
in 1987 to 9-3 in '88 and their first bowl bid in 56 years. In one game
Erickson took the Cougars to Ann Arbor to play Michigan and trailed
only 13-10 at the half before running out of gas and losing, 44-18. But
Washington State happened to throw for 334 yards and completed 61%
of its passes against the staid Wolverines. "I can't believe what you did
with that gimmick offense," Michigan coach Bo Schembechler com-
mented to Erickson after the game, a backhanded compliment if there
ever was one.
Erickson remembers these years as a kind of free pass into the end
zone for Neumeier's offense. "It was new, and nobody really knew how
to cover you, so nobody did," says Erickson. "We'd motion a guy out
of the backfield, and nobody would cover him, so we'd just throw him
the ball, and he'd go 70 yards for a touchdown." His teams exploited
matchups as few had done previously in college football. A college
linebacker in the '80s couldn't cover a slot receiver or a running back
in motion, and defenses weren't accustomed to trying.
Still, Erickson, like Mouse Davis, had to
fight for respect. Says
Tiller, "When he was at Idaho, people would say, 'That's just Divi-
sion I-AA.' Then he goes to Wyoming and well, 'That's just the wacky
WAC Then, 'Washington State is the Pac-10; they all throw it around
out there.' I don't think the offense really had much credibility nation-
ally until Dennis got to Miami. And then, wow."
The Hurricanes won national titles in Erickson's
first season in
Miami, 1989, again in '91, then lost the national title game in '92.
Gino Torretta won the '92 Heisman Trophy operating the one-back.
Not only did the Hurricanes throw, but they also ran. The one-back
forced defenses into such wide formations that massive holes opened
in the middle of the field. Coaching staffs from far and wide descend-
ed on the fields in Coral Gables to watch and learn. "One year we
must have had 20 staffs on campus at the same time," says Erickson.
"We shared everything."
Other Elway disciples, meanwhile, went forth with their own ver-
153

sions. Mike Price, in 1997, took quarterback Ryan Leaf and Washing-
ton State to the Rose Bowl. The statuesque Leaf (long since better
known for dueling Tony Mandarich as the biggest NFL Draft bust in
modern history) operated the spread one-back from a shotgun with
no tight ends. Price recruited athletes for the team from all over the
Los Angeles basin. He turned them into wideouts and then tested de-
fenses with deeper throws than any coach had previously tried with
this offense. Said Price, "I don't see anybody out X-ing and O-ing us.
We might miss blocks, drop balls. But if the offense is run right,
it
can't be stopped."
Tiller had his chance in that same year, when Purdue hired him to
bring the spread passing game to the Big Ten. It was an unqualified
success. Nine times in 12 seasons the Boilermakers won at least seven
games, and with future NFL star Drew Brees running the attack, they
went to the Rose Bowl after the 2000 season.
In 1997 Tiller and his quarterbacks coach, Greg Olson, enhanced
the Neumeier offense by adding what came to be known as the "bub-
ble" screen. To run the bubble, there are three wide receivers flanked
to one side; the two outside receivers run inside patterns, essentially
either walling off their defenders or running them deep. The inside
receiver slips back into the backfield to receive a short forward pass
and take the ball upfield. Says Tiller, "It's not too complicated. The re-
ceiver kind a makes a little forward movement and then loops around
backward, kind of like in the shape of a bubble. So we called
it a
bubble screen."
Defenses were ill-prepared against the bubble. Linebackers accus-
tomed to stopping the ground game or blitzing would invariably over-
run it; defensive backs were suckered away from the play by the deep
receivers. The bubble screen would become one of the most popular
and enduring innovations in the game.
Purdue's bubble made
its debut on the second weekend of the
Tiller era, which had begun with a loss at Toledo. Playing at home
against Notre Dame and protecting a narrow lead in the fourth quar-
ter, Purdue faced third-and-one near midfield. "Notre Dame is used
to seeing Mike Alstott [the bruising Boilermakers fullback] bang
over the A gap," says Tiller. "Instead of that, we decide to throw the
154

bubble screen and Vinny Sutherland goes for about 30 yards. The
stadium just erupted."
Purdue's win that day over the Fighting Irish helped shove the Big
Ten into the modern era of wide-open football. Watching that game
from the sideline was a Purdue freshman named Drew Brees would
become the starting quarterback for the Boilermakers the following
year. And there in West Lafayette, Ind. ? more than three decades after
being designed by a desperate high school coach a half a continent
away, the offense found its perfect triggerman.

Spread offense aficionados HalMumme andMike Leach made this a
standardplay, their variation on the "four verticals" espoused by Norm
Chow atBTUin the mid- 80s. The quarterback sets up in the shotgun with
four wideouts, two on each side, and one running back, in strictlyfor blitz
pickup. At the snap, allfour receivers work straight up thefield, reading
defenders. As the receivers are moving the quarterback, on a three-step drop,
is quickly reading theplay either left to right (1 to 4) or right to left (4 to 1).
Ifeither ofthe safeties sits down on a route, the ballgoes deep up the seam.
Ifeither ofthe cornerbacksplays soft, the ball immediately goes short. The
plays effectiveness is basedon thepressure continuallyput on the defensive
backs to make decisions, with the quarterback then exploiting those decisions.
