THEWEST
COAST
OFFENSE
It really should be named the Cincinnati Offense,
but make no mistake: This is the Bill Walsh's baby
Wishbone), how they work (the Zone Blitz) or where they come from (the
Green Bay Sweep). Then there is the West Coast Offense, one of the iconic
technical names in modern football, a name that can be heard endlessly
on college and professional telecasts every weekend in the
fall, a term
that lands in the average fan's comfort zone like a tall, cold beer. Yet it fits
none of the customary naming profiles:
It describes neither the look of
the offense nor its function. And while the name appears to derive from
its place of origin, even that is off by more than 2,000 miles. The name is
a mistake that took on a life of its own.
Here is how
it happened: The Cowboys were in the middle of their
minidynasty of the early and mid-'90s, a run that included three Super
Bowl
titles in four years, when SPORTS iLLUSTRATED's veteran NFL
writer Paul Zimmerman—the esteemed Dr. Z—visited the Cowboys' head-
quarters in Irving, Texas. The Cowboys' offense was a sweet balance of

run (Emmitt Smith and fullback Daryl Johnston) and pass (Troy Aikman
to Michael Irvin and Jay Novacek, among others); Zimmerman, always
fascinated by the technical underpinnings of successful teams, wondered
what it was like behind the curtain.
Bernie Kosar, the gangly savant who had led the University of Miami
to an unexpected national championship in 1983 and had started nearly
100 games at quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, was now in Dallas as
Aikman's backup. Zimmerman sought out Kosar to learn about the offense.
Fifteen years later, at a pre-Super Bowl dinner in a steak house in Scotts-
dale, Ariz., two days before the Giants upset the Patriots, Zimmerman told
the tale of what happened. It is a tasty slice of anecdotal football history: "I
went to Kosar because I knew he would be able to explain to me what the of-
fense was. He said, 'It's the West Coast offense. Norv Turner, Ernie Zampese,
Don Coryell, Sid Gillman.' Bernie was right, and he knew his history."
Kosar was indeed correct. The offense he was describing—Air Coryell—
was begun by Coryell at San Diego State and likely influenced by Gill-
man's San Diego Chargers teams of the 1960s. Coryell tutored Zampese,
who tutored Turner, who ran the offense with the Cowboys. This attack is
most accurately called the Coryell offense. Here again, Dr. Z's telling:
"I quoted Bernie talking about the West Coast offense, and
it got
picked up by somebody out West," he said. "I think it was a wire reporter.
But that guy mistakenly attached the term "West Coast offense" to Bill
Walsh's teams in San Francisco in the 1980s with Joe Montana. And the
name stuck. It was wrong, but it stuck."
In the often murky history of football strategy, where one man's innova-
tion spills into the next, there is no evidence that anyone but Kosar and
Zimmerman coined the name "West Coast offense," as applied in Dallas.
Its application to the '80s 49ers dynasty was inaccurate, except in the very
loose sense that both Coryell and Walsh—like almost every modern coach-
were influenced by Gillman. Coryell's and Walsh's systems were different,
their terminology was different and their basic philosophy was different.
The fact that both flourished on the West Coast, Coryell's in San Diego and
Walsh's in San Francisco, only compounded the confusion.
What came to be known everywhere as the West Coast offense—for clar-
ity's sake here, let's call it the Walsh offense—was the first passing strategy
in football to effectively attack the field from sideline to sideline rather than
92

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
from the line of scrimmage forward. The Coryell offense (the original West
Coast offense) was a downfield attack. The Walsh offense used running
backs as receivers in more extensive ways than any attack before
it and,
perhaps most significant, validated the short pass as an effective offensive
weapon when most previous systems had lived and died by the long ball.
The irony
is that Bernie Kosar and Paul Zimmerman accidentally
named the West Coast offense 23 years after Bill Walsh invented it—but
Walsh did not invent it in San Francisco or even in California or anywhere
on the West Coast at all. The West Coast offense, as it's now known to all,
was born in Cincinnati.
Cincinnati, Ohio
July 1970
THE CINCINNATI Bengals began play in the summer of 1968, an expan-
sion team whose principal owner, general manager and inaugural head
coach was the esteemed Paul Brown, who as coach of the Cleveland
Browns had won four championships in the Ail-American Football Con-
ference and three more in the NFL from '46 through '55. The Bengals won
two of their first three games in that inaugural season but finished with
a 3-11 record in the brutally competitive, premerger Western Division of
the American Football League. In the spring of '69 they used the fifth pick
of the draft to select 6' 4", 220-pound quarterback Greg Cook from the
University of Cincinnati.
Cook was a sensational athletic specimen. "Greg Cook could have been
the greatest quarterback in the history of the NFL," says Sam Wyche, who
in 1969 would back up the rookie and went on to coach in the NFL for
18 years. "You could see
it from the first day of training camp. He had
everything— size, speed, rifle arm, accuracy. He had the head to run a
system and he had the physical talent to improvise if it was necessary. He
was an incredible player."
The job of schooling Cook fell to 38-year-old offensive assistant coach
Bill Walsh, who had come to Cincinnati with Brown after a year as an as-
sistant with the Oakland Raiders. Walsh had coached nine years before
arriving in the NFL, one as a graduate student at San Jose State, two as the
head coach at Washington Union High in Fremont, Calif., and three each as
93

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
an assistant at California and Stanford. Upon joining the Raiders, Walsh's
football apprenticeship accelerated. He was put in charge of running backs
and from that perspective learned the system of head coach Al Davis, who
was just one of many who had been influenced by Sid Gillman.
Davis will be remembered as a big-play, throw-the-bomb offensive
coach, but in Building a Champion, a book Walsh wrote with Glenn Dick-
ey in 1990, Walsh gives Davis credit for much more creativity than simply
playing for the deep ball. "The pass offense [in Oakland] included an
almost unlimited variety of pass patterns as well as a system of calling
them, and utilized the backs and tight ends much more extensively than
other offenses
To develop an understanding of it took time, but once
learned, it was invaluable."
Paul Brown, meanwhile, was arguably the most innovative thinker in
the game's history. He is recognized as the first coach to use game film
as a teaching tool, and he refined classroom-style preparation into the
team-meeting model still used today. So early in his career Walsh was ex-
posed to a rich confluence of football thinkers. He came to Cincinnati as
the quarterbacks and receivers coach, ready to run an offense of his own.
And Brown gave him the latitude to tinker. And in their second season
together, 1969, he was given an athlete who could do it all.
As Walsh writes in his book:
[Greg Cook] was the finest natural talent of any quarterback I have
seen. He was a brilliant athlete—big, active, with a quick arm and
great delivery—and he had the spontaneity of Joe Montana
Those
who saw Cook would have to say that physically he was the best ever
to step on the field. He wasn't just a big Adonis who could throw the
ball 100 yards. This was a quick, graceful athlete with a lightning-fast
delivery and great instincts.
COOK BECAME the Bengals' starter as a rookie, and even though the team's
final record that year was just 4-9-1, there was a promise of much greater
success ahead. The Bengals started the '69 season with three straight wins,
including a 24-19 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, who would go
on to win the Super Bowl that year. In that game Cook was thrown to the
artificial turf in Riverfront Stadium on a blitz by Chiefs All-Pro linebacker
94

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
Bobby Bell. Cook would miss parts of four games, but the full ramifica-
tions of his injury wouldn't be known until the off-season.
Cook finished the year with an NFL-rookie-record 9.41 yards per at-
tempt and with an average of 17.5 yards per completion, a mark that has
been bettered just once in the four decades since. But he was also never
the same after Bell's hit, on a rollout that Walsh would later blame him-
self for calling. He played through the season with what was diagnosed
afterward as a torn rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder, an injury that
was regularly repaired in later years but which, in 1969, essentially ended
Cook's career. By the training camp of '70 Walsh found himself with an
offensive system designed for Greg Cook, but without Cook to run it.
Instead, the Bengals were looking for a quarterback. They had Wyche,
a two-year backup who had thrown just 89 passes and would ultimately
spend most of his career as a journeyman. They had Dave Lewis, a rookie
punter who had played quarterback in college. Brown and Walsh wanted
other options, so in the middle of training camp they acquired Virgil Carter
from the Buffalo Bills. Carter had previously spent three years in the NFL,
all with the Chicago Bears. He had started five games in 1968 (winning
four) but in '69 was benched in favor of Bobby Douglass, a rugged, 6
f 4",
225-pound quarterback who was primarily a runner. "When I was traded
to the Bengals," says Carter, "I didn't even know how to spell Cincinnati or
where it was. I had to look on a map to tell my family where I was going."
Carter could not have been more different from Greg Cook. He was
listed at 6' 1", 192 pounds but probably was at least an inch shorter than
that. "Virgil couldn't throw the ball 20 yards," says Bruce Coslet, a future
NFL head coach who was a second-year tight end on that Bengals team.
Yet Carter did have skills. In 1965 and '66, Carter had been the first in
what would be a long line of effective passers at Brigham Young. As a se-
nior he passed for 2,182 yards, an unspectacular total now but among the
nation's leaders then. All of those BYU yards, however, were accumulated
in a belly-series rollout passing game with pass-run options on the corner.
No drop-back passes, few multiple-receiver patterns.
"Greg Cook was a guy who could throw the ball down the field," says
Carter. "When it turned out that he wasn't coming back as quickly as they
had hoped, they were looking for somebody to
fill the void until he did
eventually come back. I did not have a strong arm, but I was mobile. And
95

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
I had always been able to make decisions on the run as a play developed."
The combination of a healthy Virgil Carter and an injured and uncer-
tain Greg Cook presented Walsh and Brown with a dilemma. Walsh's so-
lution was to design an offense for Carter. It is the attack that, many years
later, would be labeled the West Coast offense.
"I'm not sure what they had for Greg Cook," says Carter. "As things
moved along through training camp and into that [1970] season, Bill
Walsh started putting in more things that played to my strengths-
designed scrambles, designed waggles, quick out cuts, reading defense
as you dropped back. There was very little of the seven-step drop, pat the
ball and then fire it downfield."
Walsh would write:
Virgil was a nifty athlete, but he was not considered to have a strong
arm. We had to devise a system to
fit his abilities. The timing of our
passing game now became very important. Virgil would take three steps,
throw, five steps, throw—short, quick throws within 10 yards of the line
of scrimmage
Or we would have him sprint out, to take advantage of
his mobility, and again throw the ball short.
THE EMERGENCY system was wildly successful. The third-year Bengals,
after a 1-6 start, won their last seven games to finish at 8-6 and qualify
for the playoffs. (They were beaten by the Baltimore Colts 17-0 on the
day after Christmas; the Colts would go on to win the Super Bowl.) Carter
finished a respectable 14th in the NFL in passing, seventh in the AFC.
As Walsh wrote:
With Carter at quarterback, we won our division with a 'nickel-and-dime'
offense. It was very effective because we controlled the ball
Our spe-
cific objective was to make 25 first downs a game and control the ball with
short passing and selective running
Other people in the NFL couldn't
believe Virgil could be that effective and that we could win that way.
The offense, created out of desperation, fed perfectly into Walsh's strengths
as a cerebral football coach. "Bill's thinking was completely different from
the usual football mind-set of smash, crush, destroy," says Mike Holmgren,
96

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
who in 1986 would join Walsh in San Francisco and later take the West
Coast offense to success, and Super Bowls, in Green Bay and Seattle. "It
was a chess game. And that really was the fun part of coaching. With Bill,
it was always, 'Let's figure out how we can beat this.' "
From a technical standpoint the creation of the West Coast offense
was a watershed moment in the history of the forward pass, and one that
would influence offensive systems four decades later. "Look at the NFL
right now," said Holmgren in the late summer of 2009. "It's almost easier
to count the teams that are not using some form of this system. If a team
doesn't have a shutdown defense, like Pittsburgh or Baltimore, and if a
team isn't committed to running the football, like Miami or, again, Pitts-
burgh, they're probably using some form of this passing game. Because
there's no other way to win."
From the beginning Walsh's offense was different, in several specific ways.
1) It was the first pass offense in which timing was the critical element.
While Coryell's offense at San Diego State at the same time also relied on
precise quarterback-receiver timing, Walsh's scheme put more emphasis
on shorter, more horizontal routes. Receivers in the Walsh offense were
expected to arrive at specific locations across the field in precise segments
of time, syncing up perfectly with the quarterback's drop-back, set and
delivery. In previous offenses a receiver tended to run a pattern down the
field and the quarterback would observe him and throw if the receiver
broke open—and sometimes even if he didn't. In 1969 NFL quarterbacks
completed 52.6% of their passes; in 2008 that figure was 61.0%, a game-
altering leap in efficiency. Before Walsh, the forward pass came with sig-
nificant risk; since Walsh, it has been a much more reliable chain-moving
tool. Says Wyche, "The timing and coordination of routes had to be per-
fect, and that was very different from anything I had learned previously.
The theory of every play was a designed coordination between the quar-
terback and the receivers."
2) Walsh's passing system was the first that relied on a sequence of
potential receivers, giving the quarterback a
first, second, third and
fourth option, which he would tick off one by one on his drop -back.
"It was a progression passing game," says Coslet. "If the first guy was
open, you'd throw it to him. If the second guy was open, you'd throw
it to him. If the third guy was open, you'd throw it to him. And if they
97

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
were all covered, you always had the back coming out of the backfield.
One-two -three dump."
3) It was the first offensive system to assign and incorporate what came to
be commonly known as "hot" receivers. Walsh called them "blitz" receiv-
ers. In his book Walsh wrote, "We were always looking for ways to beat
the blitz
[Opponents] assumed that when facing a total blitz, teams
would naturally keep both backs in to protect the passer." Instead, Walsh's
teams would routinely send a running back into the void vacated by a
blitzing linebacker.
4) It was the first pass offense to conceive the attack horizontally rather
than just vertically. The difference is more subtle than the language may
imply. Certainly offenses had historically included pass routes in which
receivers ran across the field, and of course Walsh's offense included pat-
terns in which receivers ran straight down the field. But Walsh's offense
used countless routes in which receivers—sometimes multiple receivers-
would run all the way across a formation, virtually sideline to sideline,
forcing a defense to stretch itself across the field until openings inevita-
bly developed. "Bill always talked not only about vertical stretch but also
about horizontal stretch," says Holmgren. "The horizontal stretch exposed
where the voids were in the defense."
5) Walsh's offense turned conventional thinking about sustaining a drive
on its head. "At that point in time, the league was knee deep in power
running and taking long shots down the field," says former Ravens coach
Brian Billick, who briefly worked as a p.r. man with Walsh's 49ers and
later used the offense in both Minnesota and Baltimore. "Bill really intro-
duced the concept of using high-efficiency intermediate passing routes as
basically an extended running game."
Walsh wrote, "Many coaches didn't understand that style of 5-to-6-yard
completions
It was very effective because we controlled the ball."
The Walsh offense was a technical marvel, to be sure. But as time passed,
it was not only the schematic qualities of the West Coast offense that
emerged but also the very coaching style that Walsh would carry forward
through the years of the 49ers' dynasty. The enduring success of the West
Coast offense has much to do with the way Walsh taught it in the classroom
and on the field, with every aspect preached and drilled in minute detail.
"Bill really believed in the value of running after the catch, and I think
98

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
he was one of the first coaches to stress that," says Wyche. "Even back in
Cincinnati he would always preach to receivers, 'Your first move has to be
toward the goal line. Never mind trying to make that first guy miss. Screw
that. Get two yards upfield. Then try to make somebody miss.' In order to
make this happen, he was obsessive about where the ball was completed.
He always wanted passes completed above the waist so the receiver didn't
have to go to the ground."
Says Coslet, "If the ball wasn't thrown 1/2 feet in front of the receiver,
Bill would go ballistic. He was a real stickler for accuracy. And he nev-
er wanted his quarterback in the shotgun, because that meant looking
down to catch the snap, and then he wouldn't be looking at the defense
and his receivers."
In Walsh's world there was no room for good plays with sloppy execu-
tion. "I remember vividly one practice in San Francisco," says Holmgren.
"Joe [Montana] threw a ball that Jerry [Rice] had to reach back for. Just
slightly. But Jerry was so great, he just reached back, caught the ball and
turned upfield. I said something like, 'Nice job.' Well, out of the distance I
hear this voice. Miiiiiiiike. Bill would drag it out in this whiny tone. Don't
you want that ball thrown six inches in front of the numbers? And that's
the way Bill would do it, too. He would yell at the coach, and the players
would subtly get the idea and work harder so their position coach didn't
get yelled at by Bill. It was a very interesting philosophy."
In Walsh's eight years in Cincinnati, his offense flourished. In the third
round of the 1971 draft the Bengals selected Ken Anderson out of tiny Au-
gustana College in western Illinois. Anderson sat one year behind Virgil
Carter but quickly developed into an even better pilot for the Walsh offense.
He was decisive, efficient and reliable, if unspectacular. ("Anderson has re-
ceived the kind of acclaim usually reserved for a shoe salesman," wrote SI in
1975.) He also had a stronger arm than Carter and was just as accurate.
The Bengals became playoff contenders. In 1975 they went 11-3 but
lost to Oakland 31-28 in the first round of the playoffs. It would be Walsh's
last season in Cincinnati; he left embittered when Paul Brown, upon his
retirement, named Bill Johnson his successor instead of Walsh. Walsh
was gone, on to a one-year stop in San Diego and two years at Stanford.
In '79 he was hired as coach of the 49ers, where he orchestrated a near-
perfect union of players and system.
99

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
In his first draft with San Francisco in '79, Walsh selected Notre Dame
quarterback Joe Montana in the third round, famously low for a player
who would become what many feel is the best ever to play the position in
the NFL. "Physically, he was not off the charts," says Holmgren. "He had
a good arm but not a rocket arm. He was thin with skinny legs, and while
he moved pretty well, he wasn't fast. But he was so accurate. He was like a
ballerina back there, and he was always in such perfect rhythm with Bill's
style of offense."
In that same
'79
draft Walsh found Dwight
Clark, a
slow,
6' 4",
212-pound receiver from Clemson, in the 10th round. He too was a per-
fect fit for the Walsh system, a diligent route-runner with good hands who
could find horizontal holes in a defense, turn upfield and gain positive
yardage, again and again. "Dwight Clark couldn't run," says Coslet, "but
he was a great receiver."
Clark also possessed a quality that Walsh craved in his wideouts:
toughness. "Bill wanted his receivers to turn upfield and make yards, of-
ten in the middle of the field," says Billick. "They were going to get hit. Bill
wanted big guys who could take a physical pounding."
The system got better as the players got better, and there would be
more. The 49ers drafted running back Roger Craig out of Nebraska in
the second round of the 1983 draft, and Craig became the model for a
West Coast offense flare-route receiver. He would catch 566 passes in his
career, including 92 in '85. "Roger Craig was a guy who could stay on the
field," says Wyche. "Other teams in a passing down, they would have to
bring in another wide receiver. Roger Craig was already as good at catch-
ing the ball as most wide receivers." Adds Holmgren, "You always have to
adapt the system to your personnel. When I was at Seattle, we had Shaun
Alexander, and he was a great running back. But he was an average re-
ceiver and a horrible blocker. So in certain situations we had to get him
off the field. Bill could just leave Roger Craig on the field."
In 1985 came Jerry Rice from Mississippi Valley State. "He broke the
mold," says Holmgren. "A big guy [6' 2", 200] who could run and who
was tough." John Taylor, a poor man's Jerry Rice, was drafted a year later.
It was the ideal collection of players to run Walsh's system, no accident,
Walsh knew exactly what he needed.
Signature plays developed. Whereas the Coryell passing game featured
100

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
plays described principally by numbers, plays in the Walsh offense were
named with words. Example: What was termed 585 H Angle in the Cor-
yell scheme was 22 Texas in the Walsh scheme. The play any football fan
has seen most in four decades of the Walsh offense is X Shallow Cross. In
its most basic form, from a set with a tight end and two wide receivers,
the tight end runs a 10-yard cross, stretching the linebackers horizontally,
while the "X" receiver runs across the formation from the opposite side,
capitalizing on the chaos created by the tight end. The X either finds a
hole in the defense and sits down for the ball or continues across. Dwight
Clark ran
it. John Taylor ran
it. Larry Fitzgerald runs
it for the Arizona
Cardinals now. Rarely is an NFL game played—or a college game for that
matter—without somebody running X Shallow Cross.
The West Coast offense began spreading when Wyche took
it with
him to Cincinnati—back to its place of origin—as head coach in 1984 and
eventually molded pieces of the system into a no huddle offense that he
took to the Super Bowl in the '88 season. Walsh left the 49ers after beat-
ing Wyche's Bengals in that game, Super Bowl XXIII, and was replaced by
assistant George Seifert. The 49ers repeated as world champions in '89;
Holmgren stayed for two more seasons, leaving to become head coach
of the Green Bay Packers. His replacement as offensive coordinator in
San Francisco was 39-year-old Mike Shanahan, a driven football thinker
who had endured two tumultuous seasons ('88-89) as head coach of the
LA. Raiders and in '90 and '91 had been quarterbacks coach under Dan
Reeves with the Denver Broncos, tutoring John Elway.
In San Francisco, Shanahan was taking on a veteran team, where his
offensive chops would be challenged every day. And he knew it. "I was
walking onto a team that had Joe Montana, Steve Young, Jerry Rice," says
Shanahan. "You walk into that situation, you better know more about the
offense than they do. And they knew a lot."
Here
is where
Bill Walsh's brilliance visited
itself upon Shanahan.
Throughout
his
tenure
at San
Francisco, Walsh had videotaped
all
meetings—whether with the full team and coaching staff or simply with
the offense or just the quarterbacks. "Bill had a library of every meeting,"
says Shanahan. "I watched every one of those tapes.
I was watching a
coach who had won three Super Bowls in nine years, and I was watching
every meeting he conducted. It was exciting for me. It's like I was there."
101

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
After helping the 49ers win Super Bowl XXIX in 1995, Shanahan be-
came head coach of the Broncos, where he installed huge chunks of the
Walsh offense for Elway and added new wrinkles to fit Elway's consider-
able talents. "There were no seven-step drops in the West Coast system,
but John had a very strong arm and wanted some seven-step drops, so we
put them in," says Shanahan. "John was great out of the shotgun, so we
put the shotgun in."
An equally significant germination was taking place in Green Bay, where
Holmgren had taken over the Packers; shortly after his hiring, the club
traded for an unknown second-year quarterback name Brett Favre. Favre
had a powerful arm that would become mythic. "I go from the ballerina
[Montana] to this wild stallion," says Holmgren. "It was like Bill going from
Greg Cook to Virgil Carter in Cincinnati, except in the other direction."
Holmgren stayed true to basics of Walsh's offense but opened up the
formation. Where Walsh usually had two wide receivers, Holmgren be-
gan using three. His coaching staff included Jon Gruden, who would
become a head coach in 1998 at age 34, and Andy Reid, who would take
over the Eagles a year later at age 40. Both took the Walsh offense with
them and added their own touches—Gruden using many more sets and
men in motion, Reid adding a zone-blocked power running game. Both
went to Super Bowls.
As Walsh acolytes permeated the league and more teams incorporated
the controlled, short passing game, defenses predictably sought answers.
The best response came in the form of the Cover Two descendant built by
Monte Kiffin and Tony Dungy with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the '90s
and called Tampa Two (Chapter 16). The central philosophy of the Tampa
Two was to allow the short passing gains but tackle well, forcing teams to
sustain long, slow scoring drives.
"In this offense," says Holmgren, "huge chunks of yardage will happen.
But more often you were scoring on an eight- or 10-play scoring drive.
Carving up the defense a few yards at a time. The times when we really
struggled were against the teams that played that Cover Two scheme re-
ally well. They would get in that two-deep look, tackle well and really
make you earn the yards, make you execute all the way up the field.
"And all of us calling the plays would eventually get impatient," says
Holmgren. "You're making first downs and moving up the field, but it's
102

THE WEST COAST OFFENSE
like watching paint dry. You get emotional and you think, 'Enough of this
b.s. Let's try something down the field. And, of course, that's playing right
into the defense's hands."
ON JAN. 10, 1982, Virgil Carter watched on television as the San Fran-
cisco 49ers played the Dallas Cowboys for the NFC championship and
a place in Super Bowl XVT. Carter, 36 years old and five seasons out of
football, had secured his place as the first quarterback ever to play in the
West Coast offense, although that distinction would seldom be recognized
outside the game's inner circles. However, on this late evening he would
understand better than most as he watched one of the most memorable
plays in the history of the NFL.
The play was called Brown Left Slot—Sprint Right Option. It is known
now to all good football fans as simply The Catch, Montana's six-yard,
game-winning completion to Clark in the end zone with 51 seconds to
play. The play lives eternally, run again and again by way of NFL Films:
There is Montana rolling right, drifting and drifting farther until he is
nearly at the sideline, twice cocking his arm and resetting before throw-
ing high and deep to the back of the end zone. Clark has run a cross to
the inside and adjusts to Montana's roll and jumps high to catch the ball
behind Dallas cornerback Everson Walls.
Montana's first read was slot receiver Freddie Solomon, who was cov-
ered. He threw instead to the back line as he floated dangerously close to
the sideline, and it is still on occasion speculated that he was throwing the
ball away and got lucky when Clark leaped to the rescue.
Virgil Carter knew better. "That first year in Cincinnati, 1970, Bill Walsh
put in a play called Scramble Right," says Carter. "We would work on it in
practice every day. I would move right, and the outside guy would clear,
just like Freddie Solomon did, and the deep receiver would run across the
back of the pattern, just like Dwight Clark did. By '82, they might not have
been calling it Scramble Right anymore, but Joe Montana knew that Clark
was back there. I knew it, too, as soon as he threw the ball."
