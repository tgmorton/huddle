And,

it
wasn't
long before they began plucking off Coryell's assistants—obviously in
hopes of replicating this new thing. First to leave for a top job in the NFL
was Gibbs, hired to coach the Redskins in 1981. He installed the Cor-
yell offense, then sought to take away any semblance of predictability by
adding dozens of new formations and shifts from which to run the same
plays; he also built in a power running game centered on counter plays.
Gibbs's Redskins lost their first five games in 1981 but won the Super
Bowl in '82, lost it in '83 and won twice more, in '87 and '91, a dynasty
by any measure.
"No matter what you have in football," says Gibbs, "you need some-
thing you can do really well, and run it over and over again. We had the
counter game." For much of the '80s, the Redskins operated the counter
like a fine piece of machinery, using the inside zone counter and the
outside zone counter, and then developing a third counter play which
entered the language of football, fittingly enough, as the Counter Trey.
Basically, it worked like this: The strong side of the offensive line deliv-
ered gap blocks while backside guard Russ Grimm would pull and trap
85

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
the first defender outside the tight end; at the same time backside tackle
Joe Jacoby would pull and lead first through the hole between the strong
side guard and tackle, barreling upfield, 305 pounds in full, lumbering
flight, leading John Riggins or George Rogers or Earnest Byner for big
chunks of yardage.
The Counter Trey, among the most dominant single plays in the game's
history, sprung from an unlikely source. "The whole counter started, to
tell you the truth, when we saw some film on Nebraska in the early '80s,"
says Gibbs. "Tom Osborne was doing some really innovative things with
his line up front, and we were watching it and thought, God, that's good
stuff. So we stole it. We had no pride whatsoever, and really, nobody does
in this game. We all steal things." (Told, years later, that Joe Gibbs had
mimicked his blocking schemes, the forever taciturn Osborne said, "Well,
I know Joe. I talked to him. But I never knew that. I'll be darned.")
Behind the Counter Trey Gibbs kept throwing Coryell's pass routes,
adding the "bunching" of three wide receivers on one side of the for-
mation. "We kept the numbering system, the pass tree, everything," says
Gibbs. "The main thing we did that was different was that we ran the
hang out of the ball to get [the defense] close to the line of scrimmage,
and then we majored in the deep ball." Gibbs is as appreciative of Cory-
ell's influence as anyone: "Mr. Cooke [longtime Redskins owner Jack Kent
Cooke] once said, 'There are no geniuses in football.' But in a lot ofways—
the terminology, the numbering of plays, the way you read routes and his
passing tree, Don really was a genius."
While the Redskins were dominating the NFC East with their version
of Air Coryell, the Rams were using their own version a continent away.
With Zampese assisting head coach John Robinson, they melded the Cor-
yell passing game with the USC-based running game (Chapter 10) that
Robinson had learned from John McKay and used at Tailback U. With
quarterback Jim Everett and lethal F Post runner Henry Ellard leading
the way, the '89 Rams came up one win short of the Super Bowl.
They also launched another coach to prominence. After the 1990 sea-
son, Norv Turner, who had assisted Zampese with the Rams' offense,
was contacted by Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson. In two years since
taking over America's Team, Johnson had improved from 1-15 to 7-9
but wanted more from his offense. He interviewed Turner and offered
86

AIR HEIRS
him the job as offensive coordinator—with the condition that Turner
bring the Coryell scheme with him. It is hard to imagine a coach being
more ready: Turner had been steeped in this offense.
In Dallas, Turner found an ideal set of players for the system. The
third-year starting quarterback, Troy Aikman, who had thrown 36 in-
terceptions and endured 58 sacks in two seasons, was a Coryell quar-
terback waiting to happen. "The entire passing game is predicated on
having a quarterback who will turn the ball loose," says Turner. "Get
on his fifth step, or his seventh step, and when that back foot hits the
ground, the ball is out. And he has to have great anticipation, because
you're throwing into holes. So in Dallas we inherit a guy, Troy, who is as
good as anyone who has played in the system because he's such a good
athlete. He would separate from the center quicker than anyone I've
ever been around and still get set and get the ball out of his hand and
make the throws. People teaching the offense in this league still show
the first touchdown pass in our first Super Bowl [1992 season], when
Troy throws the slant to Michael Irvin and the ball goes inches— I mean
inches—above the linebacker's fingertips. That's a throw that Troy was
willing to make, and you have to be willing to make it."
If the F Post defined the early years of the Coryell offense,
it was a
route called the Bang 8 that defined these Cowboys (the Bang 8 so named
because it was a Coryell "8" route thrown very quickly—bang—and later
generically called the "skinny post" throughout football because it was a
post pattern but not run as deeply as a traditional post, thus run at a more
severe—skinny—angle). Jay Novacek, to be sure, ran the F Post brilliantly
from the flanked tight end position, but
it was Aikman and Irvin who
turned the skinny post into an almost undefendable weapon.
One player who watched the Aikman-Irvin show with interest was
Trent Green, a quarterback with the Redskins at the time. From the Skins'
sideline he watched Aikman and Irvin complete the Bang 8 with such
proficiency that his frustration turned to admiration. "The Bang 8
is a
five-step drop," he explains, "where you let the ball go based on the lever-
age of the corner. That dictates the angle of the route by the receiver and
also whether the safety is in the middle of the field or in roll coverage
[helping the corner]. Just to watch Troy and Michael run that play, you
could tell that they had repped it so many times that they could almost
87

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
make it a blind throw and complete it. From a Redskins standpoint, it was
tough to watch because we couldn't stop it. But as a quarterback, with an
appreciation of the offense, it was almost fun." Or, as Jason Garrett, Aik-
man's backup who saw the play countless times, puts it: "896 F Flat Bang
8 on the outside—if they don't roll the coverage over there, the ball is half-
way there before the receiver turns his head. And tell me that's not your
image of the Cowboys from that era: Michael Irvin catching a Bang 8."
By the time the Cowboys dynasty had captured its third Super Bowl,
concluding the 1995 season, defensive coaches were working feverishly to
counter this offensive surge, primarily with the invention of the zone blitz
in Cincinnati by defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, who then popular-
ized
it in Pittsburgh with Dom Capers (Chapter 18). In St. Louis, Mike
Martz was committed to staying a step ahead of the defensive wizards.
"With all the zone blitzes, what happened with offenses was they wanted
to know where every defender was coming from," says Martz. "So offenses
got real conservative again. Keeping another receiver in to block, that sort
of thing. We decided to do just the opposite, and that was all about the
Coryell system. We spread 'em out and said, 'Good luck finding the guy
we're throwing it to.' We took the F Post and ran it with five different po-
sitions from every formation in the playbook. We ran it with Az Hakim,
with Isaac Bruce—and Marshall Faulk was an unbelievable post runner.
At one point I counted 137 different ways we could run the F Post."
Operating Martz's system was none other than Green, now a Ram.
Green completed 28 of 32 passes in three exhibition starts, but his fun
didn't last—he went down with torn ligaments in his left knee in the
third preseason game. The offense was handed over to an unknown
quarterback named Kurt Warner, a 28 -year-old undrafted free agent,
veteran of NFL Europe, Arena Football and, at one point, a grocery store
where he stocked shelves. The system didn't miss a beat; the Rams went
13-3 and won the Super Bowl. Warner threw 41 touchdown passes, and
a legend was born.
"I loved the system from Day One," says Warner. "I loved everything
that it was about. I loved that it was deep first, then checkdowns. The de-
sign of the offense was to continually put pressure on the back end of the
defense. It was all about getting chunks of yardage.
"The F Post was
still a big part of the offense," Warner continues.

"The Bang 8 got to be a little tougher because in '99 and after that, cov-
erages were starting to change. Instead of getting single high safeties,
you would get a lot more four across, which made it harder to throw that
skinny post. So we made a living off what we call a Big 4, a deep in pat-
tern. Our inside guy would push hard on the safety and force him deep,
and then we would throw inside with the Big 4, like 18 or 20 yards deep,
and that's where my accuracy was really good, and I could separate my-
self from other quarterbacks."
IT IS October 2007, and Jason Garrett sits behind his desk in an office
on the first floor of the Dallas Cowboys' sprawling suburban complex of
Valley Ranch. The surface of the desk is half covered with play diagrams,
and a whiteboard on the wall is peppered with game planning, like some
sort of arcane graffiti. Asked to describe his offensive foundation, Garrett
leans back and says, "It's what you would have to call the Coryell offense."
More than 40 years have passed since Don Coryell grew tired of losing
two games a year at San Diego State, but the offense he founded has en-
dured like little else in football.
Garrett came to the Cowboys from Miami before the '07 season and
immediately began teaching Tony Romo in the same way that Zampese
and Turner taught Aikman. "Romo was pretty good from the start," says
Garrett. "But we absolutely had to coach him to get away from the center.
And we've had to coach receivers to get off the ball. Like Ernie always said:
'Speed, speed, speed.' None of that changes." There is still a 525 F Post in
the Cowboys playbook. An Ernie route.
Half a continent away and five months later Coryell sat at that kitchen
table in fading light after several hours spent piecing together memories,
conjuring up ghosts from decades earlier. The coaches that Coryell so
profoundly influenced are astounded that he has not been enshrined in
the Pro Football Hall of Fame. "It's mind-boggling," says Martz. "I can't
think of a coach who has had a bigger impact on what is done out there
on the field than Don Coryell."

FLANKER DRIVE
What became the iconicplay ofthe '80s was vintage Bill Walsh It was built
for his 4<)ers, and the goal was simple: Put the hall into the hands ofwide
receiverJerry Rice in open space with Rice atfullspeed. The split end on the
left runs his cornerback offtheplay, and the slot receiver (FIJfrom the left
side comes across theformation andcommands deep attention to the right.
The tight end runs a deep cross, occupying the safety in the middle. Rice (80)
runs three steps upfield, then "drives"across thefieldatfullspeed; he is too
fastfor the linebackers to track him. QuarterbackJoe Montana (16), after
afive-step drop, hits him, with an emphasis on leading him with the ball to
allow Rice to continue running all-out. Theplays design callsfor Rice, as
soon as he makes the catch, to turn upfield for additionalyardage.
