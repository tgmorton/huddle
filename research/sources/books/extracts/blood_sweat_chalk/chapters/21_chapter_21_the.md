SUDDEN DEATH PLAYOFF PERIOD
THIS GAME, which the Colts would win in overtime 23-17, has long been
described as the event that propelled pro football into its place as an all-
consuming entertainment industry in the 21st century. Itwas a perfect conflu-
ence of sport, drama and television, portending the formula that would make
football such ideal mass-market programming in the years that followed.
It is likely that professional football would have arrived where it lives
today regardless of what took place on that afternoon and early evening
on the hard ground of Yankee Stadium. The path might have been more
circuitous, and taken longer, but in
all certainty the NFL would have
eventually captured America and America would have eventually become
enraptured by the NFL.
Still, the process was helped significantly on that night in New York
by the remarkable performance of Baltimore quarterback John Unitas
and by his execution of the Colts' hurry-up offense—as
it was called
even back then—over Baltimore's last five plays from scrimmage in reg-
ulation time. Old-school NFL players will tell you that the two-minute
drill, in which teams attempt to move quickly down the field, running a
maximum number of plays in a minimum amount of time (often with-
out huddling), had been a part of the game long before Unitas displayed
it in the nation's living rooms.
"Bobby Layne was in the NFL when I came into the league in 1959,"
says Dick LeBeau, who played in the NFL from '59 through '72 before
becoming one of the league's most respected coaches. "He was a master
of the comeback, using the clock in the fourth quarter. Otto Graham [the
Hall of Fame QB who retired after the '55 season] was the same way; I re-
member watching him when I was in college and hearing about him from
other players in the league. Y.A. Tittle [who retired in '64 after a 17-year
career] could also take a team down the field at the end of the game."
But it was Unitas who turned the no-huddle, two-minute offense into
theater, and he did it most dramatically in the '58 championship game.
Twice during the final drive Unitas called two plays in the huddle, and
twice the Colts lined up immediately after completions and ran another
232

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
play without calling time out. It was standard procedure for any football
team trying to rally at the end of a game with little time left, but it was
Unitas's cool and precision in such a big event in such a grand venue that
thrilled the audience tuning in on TV.
Here was football played with breathtaking urgency. Baseball, the un-
disputed national pastime, couldn't be played this way: A tie game in the
ninth proceeds with essentially the same tempo as any other inning. In the
fourth-quarter hurry-up comeback, football had come upon something
fascinating—a better version of itself. Yet nearly three decades would pass
before a team and a coach would ask why that intensive pace had never
been employed over the course of an entire game.
Cincinnati, 1984
THE GAME'S spider web of innovation reaches to all corners of the coun-
try, yet it seems that a distinctly disproportionate amount of football ge-
nius has lived and worked in this Midwestern city. It was here in 1970 that
Bill Walsh invented the West Coast offense. It was here in '83 that LeBeau
first tinkered with the defensive pressure packages that would come to
be known as the zone blitz. It was here in '86 that Jim McNally (who, in
geographical fairness, borrowed from the experiments of Howard Mudd
not far away in Cleveland) became one of the first professional coaches to
fully commit to a zone blocking scheme.
And it was here, in 1984, that a quirky coach named Sam Wyche be-
came the first NFL coach—and most assuredly one of the first at any level
of the game—to transform the two-minute drill into the 60-minute drill.
Or, as Wyche puts it demurely, "We did everything on offense that we had
always done. We just gave up the privacy of the huddle and let the defense
listen in."
(A footnote: Use of the huddle dates to the earliest days of football, but
the implementation of organized, every-play huddling is widely credited
to H.W (Bill) Hargiss at Oregon State in 1918. Interestingly, in his '27
coaching manual, Pop Warner referenced not only the huddle but also the
no-huddle, writing, "If the huddle system is not used, the field general
should give his signals in such a tone of voice and in such a manner that
they will be easily heard and understood.")
233

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Wyche was raised in Atlanta, the older brother of Bubba Wyche. Bubba
was a brilliant athlete who once struck out every opposing batter in a
Little League game, won All-State honors in three high school sports and
went on to play quarterback at Tennessee. That wasn't Sam. "I was just
a guy on the club," he told SPORTS ILLUSTRATED in 1989. "A worker, a
classic overachiever." Sam never started a high school football game but
walked on at Furman and became the starting quarterback as a sopho-
more. In '68 he networked his way onto the Bengals' taxi squad and spent
seven years in the NFL with four teams, starting just nine games.
After Wyche retired as a player, the first coach to hire him as an assistant
was Walsh, in 1979 with the 49ers. (Walsh had been Wyche's quarterback
coach a decade earlier in Cincinnati.) Wyche aided in the refinement of the
West Coast offense, then in the hands of Joe Montana. Before the '84 sea-
son, he was hired to replace Forrest Gregg as the Bengals' head coach.
Wyche would spend a dozen seasons as a head coach in the NFL, eight
with the Bengals (including a Super Bowl appearance in 1988) and four
with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He would lose more games (107) than he
would win (84) and would be better known for veering from conventional
sideline behavior than for his record. Example: During a Bengals home
game near the end of the '89 season, the Cincinnati fans grew upset with
the game officials and began heaving snowballs onto the field. Wyche,
irate, found a microphone and chastised them over the public-address
system by saying, "You don't live in Cleveland; you live in Cincinnati."
Wyche was a truly different sort of coach. While so many football
coaches fit into a box—do it this way, do it that way, do it my way—Wyche
had no box. He probably wouldn't acknowledge a box's existence.
From a strategic perspective, nothing Wyche did was further from
the norm than his decision in 1984—his first as head coach—to attempt
running a no-huddle offense for an entire game. It was something that
Wyche had thought about for years. He had once discussed with it Hank
Stram, who had been the innovative coach of the Kansas City Chiefs in
the '60s and '70s. "Neither one of us could figure out why nobody had
tried
it," says Wyche. "That really motivated me to use
it someday."
Wyche had never believed in obedience to historical practices. He liked
to try different things. He had watched Walsh substitute the short passing
game for running the ball, he had watched Montana—who was of average
234

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
size and didn't have a powerful arm—control the game, and he concluded
that you could beat opponents with your mind. "You can't go into every
game saying, 'We'll just damn well outplay you,' " Wyche told SI in '89.
"You're looking for the two-percent edge, the surprise of a safety blitz, the
surprise of having fourth-and-12 on your own 25 and going for it. These
things are sound. They work."
For Wyche, the basic idea of the no-huddle, which was installed with
the help of offensive coordinator (and former teammate) Bruce Coslet,
was to turn what
is often a desperate circumstance—the two-minute
offense—into an aggressive one. "A big part of the thinking behind the
no-huddle," says Wyche, "was saying to your opponent, 'We're going to
take away your normal recovery time. By the end of the game, you're go-
ing to be too tired to compete.' Teams couldn't fully prepare to play us in a
week, because they couldn't re-create the tempo we were using."
It was, ultimately, an all-or-nothing proposition. In Wyche's mind
there would ideally be no occasional use of the huddle. Wyche and Coslet
reworked the entire playbook to be run in no-huddle fashion. But the
process of reaching that goal would take two full seasons to shake itself
out. In the first year the starting quarterback was 14-year veteran Ken
Anderson, who had taken the Bengals to the Super Bowl after the 1981
season. But in '84 the Bengals opened the season with five consecutive
losses. Wyche decided to take a shot with a rookie.
Norman Julius (Boomer) Esiason had been the first quarterback se-
lected in the 1984 NFL draft, a 6
f 4", 210-pound lefthander who had
thrown for more than 6,000 yards in three years as the starter at Mary-
land. He was taken in the second round with the 38th overall pick (in
stark contrast to the draft a year earlier when six quarterbacks were se-
lected in the first 27 picks, three ofwhom—John Elway, Jim Kelly and Dan
Marino—are now in the Hall of Fame).
But Wyche and the Bengals were thrilled to get Esiason, who was ac-
curate and cerebral. Esiason was given a start on Oct. 7, and the Bengals
finally got a win, 13-3 over the Houston Oilers. Esiason would start three
more games that season, which the Bengals finished at 8-8. He would be-
come the full-time starter early in the '85 campaign and almost immedi-
ately clicked with the no-huddle. "My rookie year, I had to figure out what
the hell I was doing as an NFL quarterback," says Esiason, "so Sam couldn't
235

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
fully commit to the no-huddle with me. In the next year, when I was the
starter, we did a lot more of it, and then in '86 we went to it from the first
day of training camp. And I'll tell you what: I loved every minute of it."
The Bengals' no-huddle was designed to do more than just take a defense
out of its rhythm. Most important, it made it very difficult for defenses to
use situational substitutions, whether simple packages like a nickel defense
or more complex arrangements. The Bengals would run players onto the
field so quickly that it was almost impossible for a defense to identify the
Bengals' personnel and counter with the appropriate bodies. Opponents
were often forced to play with whatever people they had on the field, leav-
ing linebackers to cover wideouts or safeties to play in run support.
The mid- and late-'80s Bengals were a collection of exceptionally
bright players, including Hall of Fame left tackle Anthony Munoz and
future broadcaster Cris Collinsworth. But the heaviest intellectual load,
by far, fell on Esiason. "What Sam and Bruce demanded of me was that I
know every formation and every personnel group and which plays would
work with which personnel groups and which formations. I had to be ex-
tremely well-prepared to do all of this at the line of scrimmage."
Each play was literally a fresh start, without a huddle. Esiason explains
the sequence:
As soon as the previous play ended, Sam would send the next per-
sonnel group onto the field, and then he would signal to me with one
hand to let me know what the personnel group was that was coming
into the game. Then he would signal me with one hand for the play.
Say he gives me "regular" personnel: halfback, fullback, tight
end, two wide receivers, and we're running a play called 28 Grace,
which is the halfback to the strong side. He would give me a hand
signal for the play. I would have to know which formations we could
use for that play—pro right, far double wing right, hum short, trips
right—and then I would choose the formation I wanted to run and
communicate that to everybody on the field. This would all happen
in the first five seconds after the referee spots the ball.
So then I yell, "Regular! Regular! Regular!" That's so the people
who are not in the regular personnel group know to get off the field.
Then
I would yell the formation. Next was the play. In a huddle
I
236

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
would have said, "28 Grace," but even though defensive players are
stupid, almost anybody who has ever played football knows that even
numbers mean a run to the right. So we needed code words.
Our code words for the "2" back were Raider, Oakland and Mil-
len, because Matt Millen was playing for the Raiders at the time.
Then I had to call right. Our right words were Denver, Trigger and
Orange. Our left words were Dallas, Bullet and Black. The blocking
scheme was Grace, so I could just say Grace or sometimes
I would
say Bible or Jesus.
So we're getting lined up, and
I would say, "Hum Raider Den-
ver Bible!" Then
I would throw out a dummy call, like "399 Fly,"
that meant absolutely nothing. Then the snap count, which was also
words. That was back when Bo Jackson was doing all those Nike
commercials, so our code was A (snap on one hut) Bo (snap on two)
Can (three) Do It (four). So I'm yelling, "Hum Raider Denver Bible!
399 Fly! Do It Do It Do It! Hut Hut Hut Hut!"
ESIASON NOT only had to communicate all of this, he had to do it while
reading the defense and quickly contemplating an audible. There were
shortcuts. If a running back was uncertain of the play call, Esiason could
quickly turn around and simply tell him the play, because his back was to
the defense. "The whole exercise was football at such a high intellectual
level," says Esiason. "Every week was a final exam. But the thing it did
best was create indecision in the defense. And any indecision on their side
of the ball was to our advantage."
In 1986 the Bengals went 10-6, and Esiason passed for 3,959 yards, a
team record that stood until 2006, when Carson Palmer went over 4,000.
But a year later, in the strike-interrupted '87 season, the Bengals stum-
bled backward to a 4-11 season (1-2 in replacement games), and Wyche's
no-huddle came under intense heat. Local media called him Wicky Wacky
Wyche; and worse, they called for his head.
One year later, however, everything clicked. Esiason ran the no-huddle
beautifully, and McNally's zone blocking scheme turned Ickey Woods,
James Brooks and Stanley Wilson loose in the run game. The Bengals
opened with six consecutive wins, finished 12-4 in the regular season
and went to Super Bowl XXIII in Miami, losing 20-16 to Walsh's Nin-
237

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
ers on Montana's touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left.
The season validated Wyche's madness, and it also spawned an unlike-
ly imitator in an unlikely fashion. During the 1988 season Buffalo Bills
coach Marv Levy accused the Bengals of skirting the "spirit" of the rules
of football in their use—or nonuse— of the huddle. Most specifically, Levy
pointed to the Bengals' habit of keeping 12 or 13 players on the field as Es-
iason began calling plays. The Bengals argued that there were more than
11 players on the field because they were exchanging personnel—some
leaving the field, some entering the field; and what's more, NFL rules only
prohibit more than 11 players in the huddle.
The issue came to a head on Jan. 8, 1989, when the Bengals played
the Bills in the AFC Championship Game at Riverfront Stadium in Cin-
cinnati. According to Wyche, a representative of NFL commissioner Pete
Rozelle, who would retire 11 months later, was sent to the Bengals' locker
room. Wyche picks up the story:
"The commissioner sent a league representative into my office one
hour and 55 minutes before kickoff. [Bengals assistant G.M./legal counsel]
Mike Brown was with me, and we tape-recorded the entire conversation.
The guy tells us Marv Levy is planning to have his players fake injuries
to counteract our no-huddle. The commissioner is worried that this will
make a farce of the game and maybe we shouldn't run the no-huddle of-
fense. So I told this guy, 'You go back and tell Pete Rozelle that he's tam-
pering with the competitive balance of the AFC Championship Game less
than two hours before kickoff. How are you going to explain that to all the
bookies and gamblers who bet on this game?' The guy walked out of the
room, came back in 30 seconds and said, 'You can run the no-huddle.' "
As
it turned out, the Bengals, as a matter of strategy, ran fewer no-
huddle snaps than normal but still won the game.
The bizarre conclusion to this episode unfolded a season later, when
Levy, offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda and quarterback Jim Kelly
installed their own version of the no-huddle offense with Kelly operating
from the shotgun. Appropriately, it was called the K-Gun. Marchibroda
installed the K-Gun in training camp but used
it only sparingly in the
regular season. It became the Bills' go-to offense only on Jan. 6, 1990, in
a 34-30 divisional playoff loss to the Cleveland Browns. Kelly ran almost
exclusively from the no-huddle and threw 54 passes, completing 28 for
238

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
four touchdowns. It was the birth of an offense that the Bills would ride
to four consecutive Super Bowls, from '90 through '93.
It was also a sweet match of quarterback and system. Kelly had been a
high school star in Pennsylvania and the first in what would become a line
of accomplished quarterbacks at the University of Miami in the 1980s. But
it was not until Kelly joined the renegade United States Football League
in the fall of '83 that he really matured as a quarterback. He first played
with the Houston Gamblers, whose offensive coordinator was run-and-
shoot offense impresario Mouse Davis. Davis quickened Kelly's release
and taught him how to read defenses on the fly. All of these would be vital
skills in the K-Gun.
"We were always pretty good in the no-huddle at the end of games," Kelly
recalls in the summer of 2009. "And we were pretty good going into half-
time. Ted and Marv both decided it made sense to try it for a whole game."
There was a fundamental difference between the Bengals' no-huddle
and the K-Gun: Esiason did not call plays; Kelly did (and is regarded as
the last pro quarterback to truly call all of his own plays—as opposed to
simply choosing from among a small number of plays at the line of scrim-
mage). In the K-Gun, the Bills streamlined their offense each week down
to 20 plays, and sometimes fewer than that.
"We probably had a total of 35 or 40 plays in the playbook," says Kelly.
"We would narrow that down every week. We used different formations,
but it was always three wide receivers, one tight end, one running back
[who happened to be the great Thurman Thomas].
"For me," Kelly continues, "it was all about quickness and feel. Every-
thing had to be so quick. As soon as a guy gets tackled, you're thinking
about the down and distance and field position and you've got to call that
next play. Then you call the protection. Then you look at the defense and
see if they're in man or zone." There were certain keys to simplify Kelly's
job at the line: If the defense had seven men in the box, he would give the
ball to Thomas and run it. If there were eight in the box (an extra safety
dropped down in run support), he would get man-to-man coverage and
throw it, often to Andre Reed.
Like the Bengals who preceded them in the no -huddle, the Bills had
smart players. Reed was a clever, intuitive wide receiver. Center Kent Hull
read defenses as skillfully as Kelly. "Kent did all the line calls," says Kelly.
239

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
"There were a lot of times when
I would call a running play and Kent
would just yell, 'Get out of it!' And I would get out of it."
Kelly recalls that, again like the Bengals, the Bills had code words
for plays, formations and snap counts. For instance, a snap count of
"on three" was "Louisville," because left tackle Will Wolford wore num-
ber 73 early in his career and was born and raised in Louisville, Ky.
Occasionally a player would be traded and take his knowledge of the
Bills' signals with him. Fred Smerlas played with the Bills in 1989 but
later played against them as a New England Patriot. "Freddy knew our
signals," says Kelly. "So on the sideline I told the offense, we're calling
on two, so I'm going to call 'Noah!' " (That was the Bills signal for 'on
two' because Noah had two of each kind of animal on the ark; in this
case, though,
it was a dummy call.) "I told everybody, 'Watch Freddy
jump.' Sure enough on the second hut, Freddy ran across the line and
was standing right next to Thurman."
The effect of the K-Gun on defenses was palpable. "It wore them out,"
says Kelly. "The pass rush would diminish as the game went on. And they
couldn't disguise coverages because they couldn't substitute. They had to
show what coverage they were in. Defenses hate that. I was really fortunate as
a quarterback that Marv Levy and Ted Marchibroda let me run this offense."
History records
that the
Bills
lost four consecutive Super Bowls,
the last three by a combined 65 points. But
it's unfair to dismiss the
49 regular-season victories and four AFC titles earned with the no-huddle.
"There was this feeling," says Kelly. "You just knew what plays were go-
ing to work, and you didn't have to think. It just came to me and we went
right down the field. It was a pretty special time."
IN THE summer of 2009, 64-year-old Sam Wyche is raking rocks off a prac-
tice football field in Pickens, S.C. (pop. 3,026), where he lives, coaches high
school football and contemplates changing the world. He won a seat on the
Pickens City Council with 80% of the vote, and on this day, he is considering a
run for the U.S. House of Representatives. "There are some people who want
me to do it," he says. But he's hesitant. "The people up there in Washington,"
says Wyche, "I'm not sure I'd have the patience to work in that system."
Perhaps not. Patience was clearly not a facet of his no-huddle system.
But risk most certainly was, and risk is the chief reason why no NFL teams
240

THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE
since Wyche's Bengals and Kelly's Bills have installed a full-on no-huddle of-
fense, and why no NFL coach is letting his quarterback call all his own plays.
Clearly the increasing complexity of the modern game makes it a huge gam-
ble to entrust an entire playbook to a quarterback at the line of scrimmage.
The closest relative of the no-huddle in use during the 2009 season
was the Peyton Manning machine in Indianapolis. But even that was not
a no-huddle in the purest sense, because it makes no attempt at increas-
ing the tempo of the game. The Colts' entire offense loiters near the line
of scrimmage while Manning receives play calls—at least three options
on every play—from offensive coordinator Tom Moore. Wyche calls this
arrangement a sugar huddle, "because it's short and sweet."
The Colts' version brings Manning nearer to Esiason than to Kelly be-
cause he is running plays relayed from the sideline (albeit to his helmet
by transmitter, not with hand signals), and although he has the option to
change a run to a pass or a pass to a run and adjust routes on the fly, he is
not actually calling the plays. Nor is he hurrying to exhaust the defense.
Those concepts are gone for now, reduced to museum pieces, awaiting
the next coach who will roll the dice and bet his livelihood that his quar-
terback can be Unitas for 60 minutes.

BASE (A) ZOOM 18 CIRCUS
Daring even by the edgy standards ofthe radicalA-n offense, the Circus
play begins with a shotgun snap to the quarterback, who rolls right
and sets up at the right hash mark. An ineligible receiver (R, a reserve
quarterback wearing a "legal
7 lineman number, like 74) runs into the
backfieldand takes a backwardpass— by the rules a lateral—from
the QB. Thefour receivers work various routes downfield, including a
"zoom motion"shallow cross by theA receiver The "new" quarterback
delivers thepass to any one ofthem depending on coverage. Iftheplay is
runproperly, the defense is likely not only to chase the rollout (the original
QB) but also to ignore the "ineligible" quarterback until its too late.
