Chapter 12
THE SPREAD
OFFENSE
How Mouse met Tiger, horrified the football establishment
phones on the table—one for close friends only and the other for lesser
acquaintances. This was early in the summer of 2005, and Vince Young
was poised somewhere between urban legend and mythic hero. Five
months earlier he had led the University of Texas to a Rose Bowl victory
over Michigan, setting the stage for a run at the national championship
in the fall of '05.
Young represented vastly different things to different constituencies.
To die-hard fans of the Longhorns, he was a savior, a modern-day James
Street, a quarterback who would return the Horns to their rightful place
at the top of the college football world. To inner-city football players, he
was the image of survival, an athlete who refused to be dragged into any
of the many evils infecting his Houston neighborhood—and who also re-
fused to be moved from quarterback to any other position on the field.
To pure football fans, he was the next link in the evolutionary chain of
offensive innovation.
Young watched himself on a video screen in the basement of the
Texas football facility. Outside the room the hallways were lined with
and—40 years later— made Vince Young famous

plaques celebrating Texas's proud football history; at the far end of the
building was a sprawling weight-training center, where players came
and went seemingly all day long. Up on the screen came images from a
Texas victory over Kansas the previous fall, Texas trailing 23-20 with
just more than a minute to play and facing fourth-and-18 on its own
45-yard line. From out of the shotgun Young ran right to the corner of
the formation, darted farther outside and made a lone defender miss
a tackle before running out-of-bounds with a 22-yard gain that would
lead to a game-winning touchdown pass five plays later. "Me and one
guy trying to make the tackle," Young says. "I like that matchup. I just
gave him a little two-step."
Another game, this one on a home Saturday night against Oklahoma
State. The Longhorns had fallen behind 35-7, embarrassing themselves
in front of a well-oiled home crowd. Young brought them all the way back
to a 56-35 win and stamped the victory with a slaloming 42-yard touch-
down run with 6:57 to play. Again from the shotgun, Young slid the ball
briefly into the belly of the lone running back, Cedric Benson, then pulled
it out and ran to the outside. "The outside guy takes me, I give it to Ced,"
says Young, explaining the mechanics of the play. "If he slants real hard
to get after Ced, then I keep it and go to the corner. He slanted real hard."
It is a sequence that would become endemic to Saturdays in the fall (and
even some Sundays).
The video session lasts for more than an hour as Young takes a
visitor through the high points of his redshirt sophomore season.
It
all has the feel of something different from ordinary football, as if the
University of Texas and Young had discovered a new way to play an old
game: A shotgun snap, a quarterback running wild or throwing from
elongated formations.
It was the result of a process long under way when Texas signed
Young out of Houston's Madison High in February 2002. What would
come to be known as the "spread offense" had percolated in various
forms at various locations for more than half a century before Vince
Young turned
it into a highlight film at Texas. Dutch Meyer coached
at TCU from 1934 through '52, and among his quarterbacks were the
legendary Sammy Baugh ('34-36) and Heisman Trophy winner Davey
O'Brien ('37-38).
136

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
Meyer embraced the idea of using the full breadth of the football
field in ways that now seem obvious but were radical notions at the
time that he began with them. In his landmark manual Spread For-
mation Football, published just after his final season at TCU in 1952,
Meyer wrote:
We found that by moving out both ends and two or three backs,
it
became imperative for the defense to scatter too. As a result the entire
defensive line was spaced so much wider that natural holes were cre-
ated and much of the power blocking necessary on closer formations
was no longer needed.
Regarding
the
passing
game
from
spread
formations,
Meyer
concluded,
".
.
.
it can be quickly seen that potential receivers, placed
out from the main body of the formation and away from a congested
defense, can move rapidly into the opponent's secondary and will have
much freedom of movement as they deploy into set patterns."
MEYER'S WRITING, in
its
simplicity, neatly described the essence of
spread football: Make the defense cover the entire field.
Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
is a football junkie who
found his comfort zone. In 37 years of coaching at two high schools
and six colleges, Davis has never worked on the defensive side of the
field. In his world defenders are one-dimensional cutouts that have
only fronts, but no backs. They are just letters squeaked onto a white-
board with a Sharpie. "I was a high school and college quarterback,"
Davis says. "I've always been fascinated by offense and the ways you
can find to move the football." For the majority of his career, what that
involved was the forward pass.
He coached Gary Kubiak at Texas A&M and they remained close
as Kubiak climbed the college and NFL coaching ladder. Under head
coach Mack Brown at Texas, he helped make dangerous passers of Ma-
jor Applewhite and Chris Simms. But in the early years of the new cen-
tury Davis saw change unfolding. He saw Rich Rodriguez employing
a wide spread offense as offensive coordinator at Tulane and Clemson
and then as head coach at West Virginia. He saw Urban Meyer take
Utah into the BCS with a combination run-pass game. And in 2002
137

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
he signed Vince Young, a 6' 5", 195-pound quarterback with a gift for
open-field running.
"His mother said to me, 'You're not going to have my son just drop-
ping back and passing the ball, are you?' " says Davis. "I said, 'No ma'am,
we're not just going to do that.'
On Jan. 4, 2006, Young led Texas to a 41-38 victory over USC in
the Bowl Championship Series national
title game. He passed for
267 yards, ran for 200 more and, with 19 seconds to play, bolted
nine yards for the winning touchdown, denying the Trojans a third
consecutive national crown. Young was dazzling, and he looked like
something new, a startling change in the game. Yet it was a change
imagined long before that night in Pasadena. Vince Young was simply
the perfect result.
Portland, Ore.
Autumn 2008
SUMMER IS gone early in the Pacific Northwest; a cold wind ripples
across the urban campus of Portland State University, tucked into the
southwest corner of the city. The Vikings play football games here in
a minor league baseball stadium but practice on a field hidden among
academic buildings and dormitories at the center of the campus, in-
visible from a block away. On a September morning the team shuffles
off the field at 9:15 a.m. after an early-Thursday practice; last to leave
the field are coach Jerry Glanville and his offensive coordinator, Darrel
(Mouse) Davis.
Wrapped in a black windbreaker, Davis throws his arm around a
visitor. "You want to get some breakfast?" he asks him. This is what
Mouse does after nearly every single morning practice: He walks off
the Portland State campus, then two blocks to the corner of 6th and
College and through the doors of the Cheerful Tortoise, a musty, dark-
wood saloon that serves a rib-sticking breakfast. Mouse takes a seat
near the front of the room, orders two basted eggs, hash browns and,
after much more consideration than one might expect from a man who
calls football plays every 40 seconds under duress, chooses sourdough
toast over wheat.
138

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
At the age of 76 Davis revels in the sudden and vast popularity of
all spread offenses because three decades ago, when he was rolling up
ungodly numbers with quarterbacks like June Jones and Neil Lomax at
Portland State, he was accused of crimes against football by the keepers
of a staid game.
"At my age," he says, hoisting a fork and stabbing at the eggs on his
plate, "it's nice to know that I'm not a complete fucking idiot after all."
Mouse—and it's best to dispense with "Darrel" right here and now
because nobody calls him that—is also an honorable man. For decades
journalists and coaches alike have attempted to credit him with the
creation of the run-and-shoot offense. (Sometimes this was a compli-
ment, but often it was not.) Just as quickly as the title was bestowed,
Mouse would make a correction. And he does it again now. "This stuff,"
he says, "it all started with Tiger Ellison." And the story of how Mouse
Davis came to find Tiger Ellison is a classic case of football socialism:
Everything belongs to everyone, especially the diagrams on a board or
the plays on a film.
Mouse was one of five siblings who grew up together in the town
of Independence, Ore. They all had nicknames: Birdie, Blackie, Tean-
cie, Tickie and Mouse. (In 1979, SPORTS iLLUSTRATED's Kenny Moore
wrote that "Their mother's call to dinner sounded like an appeal for an
exterminator.") Mouse was the youngest, and he earned his nickname
by failing to grow. He was 5' 6" and 135 pounds as a high school senior,
too small to play quarterback. But he did. Certainly he was too small to
play quarterback in college, but he did that too (at what is now Western
Oregon University). He became a coach immediately upon graduation
in 1955, and by '62 he was the head coach at Milwaukie High in the
suburbs south of Portland.
Mouse ran a basic
I formation, with a tight end, slotback and wide
receiver, and he was forever trying to use players like himself, of which
there was no shortage. "Little pissants," he says. "At Milwaukie in 1962 I
had a lot of good players, but they weren't big, physical players. That's the
case at a lot of high schools. More of your good athletes are little pissants.
Good athletes, but small.
"As a coach, everything you do comes from some previous experience,"
Davis continues. "At different parts of my playing career
I had been a
139

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
quarterback and a receiver. And I was a little pissant. So my attitude was,
you take the little guys and put them out in space and they're pretty good.
You put 'em in a slug-it-out kind of game, they're pretty average. So we
were putting them out in space."
On a spring Saturday in 1965 Davis was doing a series of "car clin-
ics" with a group of his coaching buddies. "You do a clinic, jump in
the car and go do another clinic," he says. "That's why we called them
car clinics." En route from one stop to the next, one of Davis's col-
leagues handed him a book entitled Run and Shoot Football: Offense of
the Future, written by one Glenn (Tiger) Ellison. Davis read the book
and it resonated instantly.
The forward was offered by Woody Hayes, who wrote:
I lured Tiger Ellison away from Middletown, Ohio, where he was firmly fixed
in a coaching position he often said he would never leave. He was totally
dedicated to the town and to its high school, most especially to its football
program. I got him in 10 short minutes with one long word: dedication.
"Ellison," I said, "you're the forward-passingest coach in the country,
and they say I'm the most non-passing coach that ever lived. Yet I want
you at Ohio State because of the one thing you possess: dedication—to
your family and to your school and to your community and to the great
game of American football."
In [this] book Ellison goes further toward opening up the game than
any other coach I have known. His daring departure from traditional foot-
ball will amaze you. But I have seen his teams play.
I have studied their
movies. His fantastic offense had fantastic success. It is a crowd pleaser.
You could almost bet every year that his quarterback would make the
all-state team. Yet those quarterbacks seemingly possessed only average
physical ability.
I suspect that their success can be wrapped up in one
word: dedication—to their coach and to their cause.
I am sure that every coach regardless of the level on which he works will
profit from a study of the revolutionary ideas expressed in this book.

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
GLENN ELLISON had met Woody Hayes when they were football
teammates at Denison University. In 1933 Ellison returned to his
home of Middletown to join the staff of his high school coach, Elmo
Lingrel, as a line coach and the school's faculty as an English teach-
er. (Apparently his work in the classroom was often as compelling
as his work on the practice field. His youngest daughter, Carolyn,
later wrote of him, "Glenn decided to make poetry
.
.
. come alive. He
would recite several poems to [his students] and ask them to listen
for the drumbeat in
it and to tap the drumbeat out on their desks.
That drumbeat was a pulse beat that gave it excitement, a heartbeat
that made poetry come alive!")
After 12 years as an assistant coach, Ellison succeeded Lingrel; he
would coach the Middletown varsity for 18 years and adopt a familiar
persona for a mid-20th-century high school coach:
all hellfire on the
practice field (hence his nickname, Tiger, bestowed in his very first
year as an assistant) and all inspiration off it, filling halftime locker
rooms with Rockne-esque oration, leaving young men willing to run
through walls on his behalf.
And his teams won, consistently. But in 1958, his 14th season as a
head coach, everything turned sour. Middletown went 0-4-1 in its first
five games. Not since the school began playing football in 1911 had
it experienced a losing season, but with five games remaining, that
result seemed a distinct possibility. Ellison had long coached smash-
mouth football. In his book he would write, "Our motto was: 'Hit 'em
so hard and so often with so much that they simply cannot stand up
in front of us!' This was serious football. We lifted weights all winter,
ran our hearts out all spring and dug ditches all summer to prepare
for the fall grind."
Now, suddenly, this utilitarian approach to the game had failed Ti-
ger. So, in a desperate attempt to save the season, he turned in a com-
pletely different direction. He concocted a thoroughly nontraditional
offense that he called the Lonesome Polecat, in which the center lined
up alone on the ball and the rest of the offensive line was split out
far to his left, two receivers far to his right and the quarterback alone
in a shotgun formation. The quarterback was encouraged to scram-
ble and to find open receivers. Middletown won its first game 34-0
141

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
and finished the season with five consecutive victories. "The Lone-
some Polecat taught us that an average passer with average receiv-
ers can move the football" wrote Ellison. "Average boys can become
better-than-average passers and receivers
if their coach will permit
them to throw and catch."
Following the
'58 season Ellison refined the Lonesome Polecat
into something better, something more sound. In his book he says the
Polecat "revealed that football can be fun and that fun football can
win ball games," but also that
it was "a departure into insanity, an
escape from reality." Still, Ellison was committed to this new brand of
football. He took many of the Polecat's basic principles and applied
them to his new offense.
His previous offense had had one passing play—called the run-
and-shoot—so that's what he named his new one.
It had 20 runs
and 20 passes. Middletown lined up in a double-slot formation with
two split ends uniformly 17 yards from the ball, but no closer than
six yards from the sideline. Blocking schemes were identical for
runs and passes, so as not to tip off the defense, and Ellison made
a sincere effort to make "every pass look like a run and every run
look like a pass."
It is impossible to overstate the degree to which this was different
from the norm. Middletown used the run-and-shoot for 4V2 seasons
and with it won 38 of 45 games. Ellison's team won one game 98-34;
over the life of the offense, the team punted an average of just 1.2
times a game.
When the time came seven years later to write the story of his new
offense Tiger Ellison did not cheat his readers by thinking small. His 2/2-
page introduction begins like this:
This
is the story of a revolution. A revolt started in the mind of a
football coach and ended in a new order of things on the football
field. The
revolution awakened
a
sleepy community
into wide-
eyed enthusiasm and caused a veteran coach, squirming with frus-
tration on the threshold of his
first losing season, to wake up and
enjoy life to
its fullest. In the wake of that revolution came an ex-
plosion of touchdowns popping at the rate of one touchdown ev-
142

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
ery ten plays or five touchdowns per ball game for four years.
.
.
.
[And later, this:] "Yet, have you been lately to the football sta-
dium where you found twenty-two musclemen with their heads on
each other's shoulders pushing and pulling and howling and growl-
ing while somewhere beneath them hidden from view was the oval-
shaped 'bone of contention?' The only time you saw the football
was when one side kicked
it over to the other side. What you were
witnessing was a sample of possession football the way it has been
presented to the public the past dozen years, ever since the rules
makers unwittingly foisted upon the colleges the horse and buggy
football which became the vogue in the early '50's. Three-yards-and-
a-cloud- of-dust football returned to the American gridiron because
the college coach found
it no longer expedient to divide his squad
into offensive and defensive units with each unit spending its entire
practice time perfecting the fundamentals of that particular phase of
the world's most intricate teamwork sport. The coach had to split his
practice time, half for offense and half for defense, even though there
has never been since the game began quite enough practice time to
get an offense polished to perfection.
.
.
. High school coaches,
al-
though not restricted by the new rules, nevertheless followed suit
because coaches are copy-cats, and high school coaches, including
me, tend to copy the colleges.
[And finally, this:] However, the future of this great game suddenly
looms bright because football can now start growing up again, for the
college rules makers have recanted—two-platoon football in our col-
leges is back on the American scene. College football will soon become
the greatest sports spectacle of all time, provided college coaches will
open their eyes and stir their imaginations and put the oval-shaped
ball on display before those who come to see exciting entertainment.
I was a high school coach for thirty years. For the first twenty-five
and a half years
I was a possession coach, a slave-driver, a blood-
and-thunder guy, a coach whose constant motto on the field and in
the classroom and at home was: 'Root, hog, or die— dig, little pig, or
starve to death!'
I have changed. The revolution came. This book is the story of
that revolution.
143

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
THIS WAS the book that was handed to Mouse Davis during his car
clinic in the spring of 1965. Already predisposed to run a spread
formation that would free up his pissants to run amok, Mouse took
Ellison's theories—and even more than that, his formations—and es-
calated his own attack. He spent the last 12 years of his high school
career using the evolving run-and-shoot. His last team, at Hillsboro
High, won the 1973 Oregon State Championship. A year later he was
the offensive coordinator at Portland State, and a year after that, in
1975, he was the head coach.
In Davis's first season in charge, quarterback June Jones threw for a
then-Division II record of 3,518 yards (a record that stood for a decade)
and over two seasons averaged 266.2 yards a game in total offense.
Jones's successor, Neil Lomax, became the alltime NCAA Division I-AA
total offense leader (Portland State had jumped up one division) until
being surpassed in 1994 by Steve McNair. Football purists recoiled. Da-
vis adopted a casually defensive posture. "We were told that this wacko
offense would only work in high school," Davis told SI in '79. "So it was
fun to succeed with it in college."
Now Davis likens the run-and-shoot to the triple option in one key
way: "With option reads and with run-and-shoot pass routes, the of-
fense gets the chalk last," he says. That's coachspeak. The expression
derives from the practice of coaches scheming offenses and defenses
together on a chalkboard, passing the chalk back and forth in response
to each other's moves. He who moves last has the advantage. All of
the elemental run-and-shoot plays involved option— or readable—pass
routes, where the receiver is reacting to the defense and the quarter-
back is reading the receiver. Says Davis, "I get to keep the chalk even
after I snap the ball."
The core philosophy of the run-and-shoot never changed. "The whole
thing is, when you boil
it down," says Davis, "if I play a pissant, you've
probably got to cover me with a pissant. And the more of the field that you
use, the cleaner your reads."
In the Cheerful Tortoise, with breakfast finished and the plates
cleared away, Mouse takes the visitor's notebook and diagrams a play.
He scribbles four wide receivers, each of whom breaks off the line of
scrimmage. As he draws in the notebook, Davis explains that each re-
144

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
ceiver then determines his next cut, based on the reaction of the de-
fense. The quarterback
is simultaneously reading the defense and
throwing to a spot where the receiver should be. For more than three
decades, when it was well-executed, the run-and-shoot was a gridiron
symphony when it worked well.
Yet there was loud and predictable criticism of the scheme at ev-
ery turn. Mouse was further from the football mainstream than Tiger
Ellison had been from Woody Hayes. "People said our offense was
unsound" says Davis. "They called
it flag football. That's because
football has very conservative roots, and coaches have traditionally
been a very conservative lot. You ought to be able to knock some-
body's head into the dirt or you're not a real football coach. That was
the thinking."
Mouse left Portland State after the 1980 season. In the ensuing years he
had two opportunities to implement the run-and-shoot in the NFL: with
the Detroit Lions from '88 through '90 as offensive coordinator under
Wayne Fontes and from '94 through '96 with the Atlanta Falcons as quar-
terbacks coach under his old Portland passer June Jones. Neither venture
was ultimately successful. The Lions under Fontes and Davis went 15-22
in 2% seasons, and the Falcons with Jones and Davis went 19-29 in three.
Still, five Falcons receivers went over 1,000 yards in those three seasons.
"Both places," says Davis, "we moved the shit out of the ball."
But
it was in Houston that the run-and-shoot really moved, with
three different teams: the Houston Gamblers of the United States Foot-
ball League, the Houston Cougars of the NCAA and the Houston Oilers
of the NFL. For nearly a decade, beginning in 1984, Houston was run-
and-shoot central.
Former NFL linebacker Jack Pardee coached in
all three places.
With the Gamblers both Davis and a tall, cocky Texan named John
Jenkins—nearly nine inches
taller than Mouse—were offensive as-
sistants. The quarterback was Jim Kelly, who would later take the
Buffalo
Bills to four Super Bowls while running a slick no-huddle
(Chapter 21) as one of the last NFL quarterbacks to call his own plays.
"I
tell everybody
I learned the passing game from Mouse Davis in
Houston," says Kelly.
He had been a college star at Miami but says, "I had never learned
145

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
proper footwork. I had never learned to throw on the run. When I got to
Houston, I was almost starting from scratch. But Mouse, he was almost
like a college professor with me. He had a way of explaining the run-and-
shoot that let you really understand the reads and the options.
I was a
believer from Day One."
Kelly left the ill-fated USFL after the 1985 season. Pardee also
left that year and took Jenkins with him in '87 to the University of
Houston, where Jenkins installed the run-and-shoot. In the '89 sea-
son Andre Ware passed for a then-NCAA record 4,699 yards—an
unheard-of number—and won the Heisman Trophy, prompting an
outcry that a gimmick system had hijacked college football. It would
get worse. (Or better.)
When Pardee went to the NFL in 1990, Jenkins took over the
Cougars and rode the run-and-shoot to a 10-1 season in which they
scored more than 50 points five times and on the night of Nov. 17 in
the Astrodome beat up on Eastern Washington 84-21, with Hous-
ton quarterback David Klingler throwing 11 touchdown passes. Three
weeks later in a game in Tokyo, Klingler shredded Arizona State for
716 passing yards. Both records are still standing to this day. Comfort-
ably. In a Sports Illustrated story that was written in the sum-
mer of 1991 Cougars assistant Tony Fitzpatrick said, "Jenks is so far
ahead of everybody else, it's a joke. Mouse comes in here now, looks at
our films and even he doesn't understand them. Spreading the field?
Mouse had [the Gamblers'] slot guys split arm's length from the tack-
les. Jenks would have them start their routes over by the Gatorade
carts if they could."
The epilogue is less glorious. Jenkins's second and third Houston teams
went a combined 8-14, and by '93 he was gone.
But Pardee proved that the run-and-shoot could be employed ef-
fectively in the National Football League. From 1990 through '93,
with Warren Moon at quarterback, the Oilers averaged more than
10 wins a season and went to the playoffs in four consecutive years.
Other devotees always returned to
it. When June Jones became the
head coach at the University of Hawaii in 1999, he installed the run-
and-shoot and went on to win 75 games in nine years, while quar-
terbacks Timmy Chang and Colt Brennan rang up dazzling numbers.
146

THE SPREAD OFFENSE
From 2004 through '06, Davis was one of Jones's assistants before
returning to Portland.
Football archeologists understood that even when the run-and-shoot
did not lead to big victory numbers, it always advanced the cause of in-
novative offense. As an even more compelling measure of its worth, the
run-and-shoot became immensely popular with high schools populated
by Mouse Davis's physically overmatched pissants. Tiger Ellison would
have been proud. A revolution, indeed.

by its effectiveness. Defenses werejustgetting accustomed toplaying against
four-widepassing offenses, and the bubble screen was a totally unexpected
new wrinkle. The action is all on the three-wideout side. At the snap the
two outside receivers run inside-leaning routes, in effect taking away at
least two inside defenders and creating left-side space. The inside receiver
uses a slip move into the backfield, movingforward then looping back, a
bubble-shapedpattern thatgave theplay its name. The quarterback hits the
bubble receiver with a quickpass and the receiver turns upfield where the
