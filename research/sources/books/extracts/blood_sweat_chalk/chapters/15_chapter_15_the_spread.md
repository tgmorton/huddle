THE SPREAD
OPTION
The game changed on a hobbled ball by an obscure
quarterback at a school you've never heard of
head coach at Glenville State College, a National Association of Intercol-
legiate Athletics (NAIA) institution in Glenville, W.Va., halfway between
Morgantown and Charleston. Rodriguez was just 27 in that first season
but already a veteran of sorts; he had been only 24 when he was named
head coach at Salem College. That school dropped its program after a 2-8
season. Glenville started no better in Rodriguez's first year, going 1-7-1.
During that same fall a young quarterback named Jed Drenning was
trying to find someplace where he could settle and have a college foot-
ball career. As a high school quarterback he had twice led Tucker County
High in Davis (a town of 624) to the West Virginia Class A state cham-
pionship. From there he had gone to Samford University in Birmingham
to play for Terry Bowden.
Drenning transferred after two seasons and sat out the '90 sea-
son while awaiting clearance to restart his career at the University
of West Virginia. Then came word that at Glenville, Rodriguez would
be running the multiple I formation offense, a staple of the Bowden
family of coaches and familiar and comfortable to Drenning, so he

switched again and rolled on down to Glenville to play for Rodriguez
in the fall of 1991.
There were more surprises ahead. "I get to campus for practice," says
Drenning, "and the first day on campus I run into Dean Hood, who was
our defensive coordinator. He says, 'Did you meet your offensive coordi-
nator?' And he's smiling, and I ask what's so funny, and he says they're
putting in the run-and-shoot."
Drenning was clueless as to how to operate the run-and-shoot, and
predictably, it was not an immediate success in Glenville. Entering an
October game against Wingate University in that first year, Glenville
State was 1-3-1; worse, Wingate had beaten Glenville 63-0 the previ-
ous season. Even more ominous—in fact downright frightening—was
that Drenning had been sacked 32 times in the previous two games.
Fearing for his health, Drenning was constantly bugging Rodriguez to
run from a shotgun formation, to at least give the quarterback an extra
beat to find receivers and an extra step of safety from the ferocious
pass rushes they were seeing.
On Monday before the Wingate game Rodriguez asked Drenning,
"How often do you want to run out of the 'gun?" Drenning answered,
"Coach, I'll run the clock out in the 'gun if you want." Glenville went to
the shotgun for the entire game and narrowly missed pulling off the up-
set, losing 17-15.
They stayed in the 'gun for the rest of the year, finished 3-1 down
the stretch and began shaping the offense that Rodriguez would so ef-
fectively run later as a coordinator at Tulane and Clemson and as head
coach at West Virginia. "Whatever incarnation of Rich's offense exists
today," says Drenning, "it was born that day when we played Wingate.
And he turned the place around pretty quickly after that."
There would be one more major invention. Rodriguez was not the
first offensive-minded coach to operate the run-and-shoot from a shot-
gun, but his next move was almost surely an original one.
It was the fall of '92, and Glenville was en route to a respectable 6-4
season while operating its run-and-shoot almost strictly from a one-
back shotgun. (Mouse Davis, back in the day, had never used a shot-
gun.) Included in Glenville's offensive package was a series of running
plays using zone blocking in which Drenning would receive the snap

and stick the ball in the gut of a running back lined up next to him.
One afternoon Drenning bobbled a snap on one of these zone-
blocked running plays. Unable to get the handoff delivered to the run-
ning back, Drenning tucked the ball himself and saw the backside
defensive end crashing down the line of scrimmage to tackle the run-
ning back—who, in fact, did not have the ball but was behaving as if he
did—from behind. On a broken play the quarterback customarily fol-
lows the running back into the assigned hole and tries to salvage yard-
age. But Drenning, seeing the end closing, instead ran wide into the
area vacated by the end. "It was just an instantaneous reaction thing,"
says Drenning.
After the whistle, Rodriguez casually asked Drenning, "Why did you
do that?"
"Do what?" said Drenning.
"Why did you run that way?" Rodriguez said.
"The end pinched," said Drenning.
Rodriguez nodded, as
if to say, Oh, uh-huh. This, as best anyone
can tell, was the birth of the modern "zone read," now a cornerstone
play in any run-based or balanced spread offense. It is the play that
essentially
fulfilled Jack Elway's wish—to add an option run to
a
spread passing game.
It is a play that, in effect, wed Tiger Ellison's
run-and-shoot to the Texas wishbone, because the zone read is simply
another version of the same read that triggers the wishbone triple
option. In the wishbone the quarterback reads the defensive tackle;
in the zone read he reads the backside defensive end, just as in Jed
Drenning's accident.
Glenville State rode Rodriguez's offense to 32 wins in his last four
years there, and then Rodriguez rode it into Division I—first at Tulane,
where he was offensive coordinator under Tommy Bowden in 1997 and
'98. The quarterback there was Shaun King, and the offense was made
vastly more flexible and complex.
"It wasn't really a run-and-shoot because we were 50-50 run and
pass," says King. "But in the passing game we had four wides, and we
tried to challenge vertically as well as spread the field. There was a lot of
two-by-two mirrored formation stuff [two wide receivers running mir-
rored patterns on each side of he field]. All of our runs had an automatic
165

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
slot check;
if the slot was uncovered on a running play,
I would just
throw it to the slot guy."
Rodriguez also tried to ramp up the zone read, but King, who was
an accurate thrower and a better athlete than Drenning, wanted no
part of it. "We put in the zone read," says King. "You don't block the
weakside defensive end. The quarterback reads that guy. But I never
wanted to keep the ball, because there was no blocker over there [to
protect me]. I told Rich not to call running plays for me. I said that if
nobody's open, then I'll run it, O.K.?" This happened often enough that
in 1998, when Tulane went 12-0, King became the first quarterback in
NCAA history to pass for 300 yards and run for 100 in the same game,
a 49-35 win over Army.
But at Rodriguez's next stop, Clemson, where he went with Bowden
in 1999, again as offensive coordinator, his quarterback was Woody
Dantzler. While he was a less capable thrower than King or Drenning,
he was a far superior runner. In 2001 Dantzler became the first col-
lege quarterback to pass for 2,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in the
same season.
By then Rodriguez had left for West Virginia to become head coach,
and there, in 2005, a quicksilver freshman quarterback named Pat
White proved to be the perfect pilot for the Rodriguez spread. In the
'08 season (and once again Rodriguez had already moved on, this time
to Michigan), White became the first quarterback in college football
to pass for 5,000 yards and rush for 4,000; twice he had thrust West
Virginia into the national championship race. "The genius of Rodri-
guez," says King, "is in the way he's used different quarterbacks. He
did things one way with me and then another way with Dantzler and
then another with Pat White."
Even as Rodriguez was busy reconfiguring offensive football, he had a
shadow. Urban Meyer is a year younger than Rodriguez. Meyer was raised
in Ohio, Rodriguez next door in West Virginia. But while Rodriguez was
twice a head coach at obscure schools before turning 28, Meyer was tak-
ing a more traditional path, working as an assistant at Ohio State, Illinois
State, Colorado State and, from 1996 through 2000, under Lou Holtz and
Bob Davie at Notre Dame. He got his first head coaching job in 2001 at
Bowling Green, the same year that Rodriguez got his third head job.

THE SPREAD OPTION
"When we got to Bowling Green,
I
felt like we were a
little under-
manned,"
says
Meyer. "So we
started asking each
other,
as
a
staff,
'How can we move the ball?' We tried to put together a combination
quarterback-run, passing game, with our entire goal being to create num-
bers for the offense. Where can we get an advantage?"
The philosophy was not unlike Rodriguez's: Try to balance a sophis-
ticated pass offense while making the quarterback a viable threat as a
runner. Against conventional offenses, defenses essentially ignore the
quarterback as a potential ballcarrier; if the quarterback becomes a run-
ning threat, a defensive player has to be assigned to track him, limiting
that defender's freedom to move to any other point of attack. "If you can
make the defense account for the quarterback," says Meyer, "that meant
one guy you didn't have to block."
Meyer learned much of his attack from two sources. The passing
game came from Louisville and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan
(who had played at Idaho for Dennis Erickson and would later become
head coach of the St. Louis Rams). Meyer had visited Linehan at Louis-
ville. "We went down there with the intention of staying one day," he
says, "but we stayed for about five days. We studied their whole pass-
ing game and the idea of spreading the field with five-man protection
and no backs."
Meyer's quarterback-run game was copied in large part from Kansas
State's offense of the '90s under coach Bill Snyder. When Snyder took
over the Kansas State program in 1989, the Wildcats were infamously
proclaimed by SPORTS ILLUSTRATED to be "The Worst Football Pro-
gram in America." In less than a decade K-State would contend for the
national championship.
The first steps in the climb came on defense, in which young assis-
tants like Bob and Mike Stoops (later the head coaches at Oklahoma and
Arizona, respectively) and Jim Leavitt (South Florida) put together an
unorthodox, high-pressure package that was effective on Saturday but
also all week long.
"They were very smart young guys, and they got us into what
I
thought was a very innovative defense," says Snyder. "They put a de-
fender in every gap, rolled up the corners and got eight men in the box,
and consequently, we were very, very good against the run. But as a
167

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
result of that, when we practiced against ourselves during the week, we
were not very good on offense. We had to get better.
"We had to create some running lanes, and the answer was pretty
simple: Involve the quarterback in the running game. So essentially
what we did was run every play that we had been using in the run game,
but we gave ourselves the option of running
it with the quarterback,
which forced the defense to account for him as a ballcarrier. That took
one man out of the box." The Wildcats had power plays and counter
plays and trap plays and, eventually, the zone read. They had talented
quarterbacks, most notably Michael Bishop, who led the Wildcats to the
Big 12 championship game in 1998.
More than one football historian has argued that Snyder, Meyer,
Rodriguez—and many others—were really running nothing more than
a modernized version of the single wing. Pop in a couple of DVDs,
watch both offenses at work, and it's clear that the argument holds a
lot of water.
Meyer took the Louisville passing game, mixed it with the Kansas State
run game, and won 39 of 47 games in four years at Bowling Green and
Utah, taking the latter to a BCS bowl after the 2004 season and finishing
the year ranked No. 4 in the nation. At Florida, with more talent than
most of his opponents, Meyer won the '06 and '08 national titles, and
in '07 quarterback Tim Tebow won the Heisman Trophy after throwing
for 32 touchdowns and running for 23 more, a statistic that eloquently
speaks to the balance of the attack.
Tiger Ellison would have loved those numbers, illustrative of where
his original master plan has taken the game. The question that follows
logically—and is routinely dismissed by coaches and pundits alike—is
whether the NFL will soon employ a spread game similar to the one that
prevails in college football, and whether quarterback runs would be part
of the system.
Many NFL systems are already rooted in the spread passing attack.
The New England Patriots went unbeaten in the 2007 regular season,
with Tom Brady often running out of a five-wide, empty-backfield set and
isolating Wes Welker—the ultimate version of Mouse Davis's pissants—
on linebackers who couldn't hope to cover him.
But Brady wasn't running the ball. "At the NFL level you invest an
168

awful lot of money in the quarterback," says Linehan. "And if you're go-
ing to run that college stuff, you're putting him in harm's way. But some-
body is going to come in and do it effectively. The Falcons did it some
with Vick. The Titans with Vince Young. NFL teams don't spend a lot
of time preparing to defend the option, so you're going to wreak havoc
with coordinators. And the team that incorporates the option effectively
at the NFL level, well, all bets are off."

TAMPATWO
Popularized in the late 9 0s by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers under coach
Tony Dungy and defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, the Tampa Two is
afull-defense (11-man) extension ofthe Cover Two secondary defense (a
four-man pass coverage "shell") that teams had usedfor more than two
decades. The Tampa version is the ultimate bend-don t-break defense,
designed to eliminate bigplays andforce the offense to methodically
drive the length ofthe field. Two deep safeties share the deep zones.
(The name "Cover Two" derivesfrom these two deep safety zones.)
The cornerbacks disrupt wideouts at the line ofscrimmage. The most
demandingposition is middle linebacker; he isforced to drop as much as
30 yards into the middle toprevent completions on deep crossing routes.
