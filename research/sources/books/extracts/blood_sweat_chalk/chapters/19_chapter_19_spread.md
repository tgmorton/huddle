Joe Lee Dunn uses a 3-3-5 defense, Gary Patterson uses a
4-2-5, both for the same reason: dread of the spread
toriously generous lot, these coaches, and spring is their giving season,
as they freely open their playbooks and film rooms to others who might
line up against them in future years, all in the name of collegial courtesy.
But when 44-year-old Joe Lee Dunn boarded a plane from Memphis to
Los Angeles in the spring of 1991, his motivations were entirely differ-
ent. He was scouting for the coming fall, and he was scared to death.
Dunn was beginning his third season at Memphis State under head
coach Chuck Stobart, and the upcoming season's schedule included an
opening game against Southern Cal on Labor Day afternoon in the storied
L.A. Coliseum. It would be the first—and to this day the only—meeting
between these two schools, one a foot soldier in the weekly college foot-
ball wars, the other a titan.
Any national attention was focused on the fact that Memphis State was
taking the matchup—or mis-matchup—largely for the $300,000 guarantee
that USC was paying the Tigers for making the trip. But Dunn, the defen-
sive coordinator, only wanted to know one thing: What the hell was his
undermanned defense getting into? So he visited USC's spring workouts.
LosAngeles, Calif.
Sept. 2, 1991
T'S NOT unusual for college
football coaches
to use the
spring of the year to pay visits
to their peers. They are a no-
211

The team he saw on the practice field was not the USC of O.J. Simp-
son, Charles White and Marcus Allen. Nor was
it Pete Carroll's USC,
which would take off more than a decade later. Larry Smith was pre-
paring for his fifth season as coach of the Trojans. He had relieved Ted
Tollner, who won 26 games in four seasons—not good enough on the
heels of the John McKay-John Robinson dynasties that had produced
five national championships from 1962 through '78.
Smith had, so far, been better. His Trojans won 27 games in his first
three seasons and went to three consecutive Rose Bowls. In 1990 they
finished 8-4-1, including a loss to Michigan State in the John Han-
cock Bowl in the last game of the turbulent, two-year Todd Marinovich
quarterback era.
That loss, and that season, were a harbinger of struggles ahead. But
that mattered little to Dunn, who was accustomed to watching his play-
ers at Memphis State; to his eye, there was
still plenty of talent out
on that field in Los Angeles. "I was there for a few days," says Dunn,
"and I saw those USC guys walking around, up close. They were even
scarier that way than they were on film. Big, good-lookin' guys and all
that. Mighty impressive.
I went back to Memphis and told everybody,
'There's no way in the world we're going to beat those guys.' "
Dunn grew even more certain when he started game-planning for the
Trojans with his own defense at Memphis. He had been a football coach
for 21 years and had always played a five-man defensive front, usually in
a 5-3-3 alignment: five linemen, three linebackers, three defensive backs.
But Dunn looked at USC and saw too much speed to defend with five
bulky defensive linemen; he just had too many slow-footed players and
too few fast ones.
In his moment of need, he was struck by an idea. "I didn't think we
could just line up and play against USC," recalls Dunn. "But I thought
maybe we could run something that would confuse them. So here's what
we did: We backed up the two defensive ends about seven yards off the
line of scrimmage and about three yards outside the tight end, or wher-
ever the tight end would normally be. We put those guys in space. Once
I had the idea, it was a pretty easy transition to make."
In fact, it was jarring, a sea change in defensive scheming. But some
minds accept risk more readily than others. Two decades earlier Dunn
212

SPREAD STOPPERS
had coached a season of high school football in Georgia with a coach
named Bob Nellums. "He did all kinds of crazy things," says Dunn. "He'd
stand the whole defensive line up. Nobody with a hand on the ground. He
was creative and changeable. I always remembered that."
Moving the defensive ends back and outside turned Memphis State's
5-3-3 into a 3-3-5, with those defensive ends acting essentially as hy-
brid linebacker-strong safeties. In the post-Marinovich era, USC was
attempting to run some option football with quarterback Reggie Perry.
Memphis State's alignment brought defenders in closer to the edge at
the snap and filled open space on the field.
It was not an immediate
success. Before a half-full Coliseum, USC took a 10-3 halftime lead;
Trojans tailback Mazio Royster rushed for 97 yards on 20 carries in the
first 30 minutes.
But Memphis State owned the second half. USC failed to score again,
making just three first downs in the first 20 minutes as Memphis took
control. The Tigers put up 21 consecutive points to win 24-10. The upset
reverberated through the college football world. There had always been
upsets, but in the fall of 1991, college football was still a game of haves
and have-nots. The day after the defeat USC coach Smith would call the
loss "perhaps the biggest upset, disappointment and embarrassment this
university and football program has ever had."
For Dunn, it was, of course, equally shocking. "Really a remarkable vic-
tory," he says, nearly two decades later, still amazed by what took place that
afternoon in Los Angeles. But it was something more than an upset. It was
a small window into the future of the college game, where long-held prin-
ciples would give way to a new set of rules. Nevertheless, the next weekend
in Memphis, the Tigers played host to Mississippi and Memphis State went
back to Joe Lee Dunn's 5-3-3 defense. "But I didn't forget about that USC
game," says Dunn. "I put that 3-3-5 in the back of my mind."
Abilene, Texas
November 2009
MAYBE THIS
is the last stop for Joe Lee Dunn.
It
is a Wednesday in
November, and another season is coming to a close, his 39th as a football
coach. He has landed as defensive coordinator at tiny NCAA Division III
213

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
McMurry University (enrollment: 1,500) in Abilene, where Hal Mumme
is now the coach. In 2007, when Mumme, the erstwhile pioneer of the
spread passing game, was named head coach at New Mexico State he felt
himself slipping down the coaching ladder he'd once climbed. Dunn had
just been fired a year before back at Memphis after three seasons under
coach Tommy West. So Mumme, once bedeviled at Kentucky by Dunn's
varied and relentless blitzes at Mississippi State, had hired Dunn to run
the Aggies' defense.
After four years at New Mexico State, Mumme was fired, and now
had dropped another rung, to McMurry. On this day there is but a sliver
of hope for a successful end to the season: McMurry had begun the
campaign with four consecutive losses then turned it around with four
consecutive wins before falling at home to Hardin-Simmons 21-10. In
a few days the season would end 489 miles to the east in Pineville,
La., against a very good team at Louisiana College. "I think we've got a
chance to win," Dunn says, "but I'm afraid the guys are kind of deflated
after last week, losing at home to our rival and all. So I don't know ..."
It's a grueling bus ride, nearly eight hours each way, across Texas and
over the border into Louisiana. And, sure enough, McMurry gets pasted,
55-13. For much of the long, quiet ride home, Dunn will settle in and
read a book, but he takes a little time to reflect on all the years gone by. "I
started out this way," he says. "I guess maybe I'll end up this way."
He had been a high school quarterback and defensive back in the
mid-1960s at Columbus (Ga.) High, where he played under former
Auburn All-America Jim Pyburn. "You talk about mean as a snake,
that was Coach Pyburn," says Dunn. "But he was a heck of a football
coach." Dunn played in college at Chattanooga, then coached at sev-
eral high schools before starting his long college career with a nine-
year run (1971-79) back at his alma mater, Chattanooga.
Dunn coached low-down, nasty defense at every level. He pushed
bodies up to the line of scrimmage, filling the box with tacklers. He
blitzed like crazy. "But I got to be honest with you," he says. "People
didn't throw it around all that much, didn't spread out all those wide
receivers." From 1980 through '86, he coached at the University of
New Mexico, the last four seasons as head coach. Every year the Lobos
played Brigham Young. And there Dunn saw how different the game
214

SPREAD STOPPERS
could be. Brigham Young did throw it around and did spread out all
those wide receivers. And Dunn decided he would not sit back and
watch. The '80 Lobos beat BYU 25-21 and pounded Jim McMahon.
"By the end of the game," says Dunn, "Jim was throwing the ball at
his linemen's feet just to get rid of it." New Mexico lost to Brigham
Young in each of the subsequent six years, sometimes by huge margins
(66-21 in 1983), sometimes by very small margins (31-30 in '86). But
Dunn never stopped bringing the heat. "Joe Lee Dunn was a blitzing
guy," says Robbie Bosco, the Brigham Young starting quarterback dur-
ing three of those seasons, from '83 through '85. "You knew what you
were going to get, and you knew you were going to get it all day."
Dunn began to understand that creativity and speed were going to be
the new keys to defensive survival.
He was not alone in reaching this revelation. When little-known
Oklahoma State head coach Jimmy Johnson took over at the Univer-
sity of Miami in 1984 (in the season immediately after Howard Schnel-
lenberger had guided the Hurricanes to a stunning upset of Nebraska
in the '83 Orange Bowl to win the national title), he took a good look
around and promptly reached into the deep well of speed and athletic
talent in Florida's high schools. Stressing speed over size in his recruit-
ing, Johnson began changing the way positions were deployed, shrink-
ing the acreage of the field.
"We took safeties and made them linebackers; we took linebackers and
made them defensive linemen," says Butch Davis, who came to Miami
with Johnson from Oklahoma State as the 'Canes defensive-line coach.
"Jimmy wanted to make every position faster.
It was
all about speed."
It was a philosophy that helped Johnson win a national title in the 1987
season, and when it worked for Johnson at Miami, every college coach in
the country, it seemed, tried to follow suit.
Dunn, meanwhile, kept moving: Two years
at South Carolina in
1987-88 (it was there that his best friend, head coach and former New
York Giants flanker Joe Morrison, died of a heart attack; Dunn found
him on the floor of the locker room shower). He went on to Memphis
and that epic upset of USC, then to Mississippi (where the Rebels led
the nation in defense in '93), then to Arkansas for a single year, in '95.
He landed at Mississippi State in the spring of 1996 and would spend
215

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
seven years in Starkville under coach Jackie Sherrill. There Dunn finally
went fully back to the 3-3-5 for the first time since that Labor Day in L.A.
in 1991. He did
it because, like Jimmy Johnson, he wanted to put fast
people in space. But he also did it because he just couldn't find enough
big defensive linemen to play a 4-3 or a 5-3-3.
"About the time
I got to Mississippi State," says Dunn, "it started to
be where there were not a lot of schools in the country that could get big
oF defensive linemen. It's hard to find those big guys that are really good.
And if you're at Mississippi State and you do find one of them, Florida
is probably going to come in and take him away from you. Or Texas. Or
somebody like that. But if you're willing to go to a 3-3-5, look, you can
get good people on the field. When you're out recruiting, everybody's got
linebackers. Everybody's got strong safeties. Put those guys out there and
let them make plays for you."
Dunn helped turn Starkville, Miss., into every other SEC team's worst
nightmare. In 1996 the Bulldogs beat No. 8 Alabama, and a year later
they knocked off No. 11 Auburn. By '98 Mississippi State was a big dog,
advancing to the SEC title game and a loss to Tennessee in the Georgia
Dome. In 1999 Dunn's defense led the nation, giving up a paltry 222 yards
a game. All of this Dunn did with his bold 3-3-5, using five defensive
backs—two corners, two strong safeties and a free safety.
Dunn worked his scheme relentlessly. He spent one off-season learn-
ing how to pressure with a three-man front, getting schooled on slants
and stunts by Michigan head coach Gary Moeller, who had been Bo
Schembechler's defensive coordinator. He worked to recruit free safe-
ties who could tackle; in the 3-3-5, the free safety is the often the first
man to the ball.
It was serendipitous
that while Dunn was going
all-in with the
3-3-5
on his side of the ball, spread formations were proliferating
throughout college football on the offensive side. The 3-3-5,
it turns
out,
is well-suited to defending the modern spread. In the 3-3-5, the
down linemen almost always slant left or right, and behind them— of-
ten "stacked" directly behind them—the linebackers fill gaps left by the
slanting linemen. Consequently, offensive linemen are forced to push
deep downfield to block in the running game, often tipping off the di-
rection of the play with their movements in space long after the snap.
216

SPREAD STOPPERS
The two outside defensive backs act as conventional corners, but the
three other DBs can play either zone against four wideouts or straight
man-to-man against five wides. (Typically, if Dunn sees five wides, he's
blitzing six defenders against five blockers and gambling that he can get
to the quarterback before one of those five wides beats somebody.)
It would be an exaggeration to say that the 3-3-5 can shut down the
modern spread. From 1991, when Dunn first put those linemen in space,
through 2007, passing yardage increased in major college football by
more than 43 yards a game and scoring by nearly five points a game.
The 3-3-5 is a defensive answer, but not a solution. "In the last 10 or 12
years, somebody decided that fans like scoring," says Dunn. "They let
offensive players hold now. They don't let defensive backs hit receivers
after they release. I don't like all of that, but I suppose it's good for the
game. We're just doing the best we can."
And Dunn's phone never stops ringing. "You wouldn't believe how
much it rings," he says. "People calling and asking about the 3-3-5. 1 just
tell 'em what I know."
Fort Worth, Texas
November 2009
A CAR trolls the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex; TCU head coach Gary
Patterson is at the wheel. Patterson, too, is just doing the best he can,
and that's mighty good in the autumn of 2009. He is three days away
from a regular-season-ending 51-10 trouncing of New Mexico, which
will leave his Horned Frogs with a 12-0 record and their first perfect
season in 71 years. "We can play with anybody," Patterson will say after
that game. He has put TCU into the middle of the BCS discussion, and
as messy and convoluted as that discussion can be, it's important that
the boundaries of the system be tested by schools once regarded as
outsiders. Like TCU.
As Patterson guided TCU onto that hallowed ground, he was 49
years old. At the same time that Joe Lee Dunn, 14 years Patterson's
elder, was contemplating a 500-mile bus ride across Texas and Louisi-
ana and the approaching end of his career, Patterson's name was sur-
facing in connection with the soon-to-be-vacant coaching job at Notre
217

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Dame. Different men in very different stages of their careers, yet they
came from a similar place in the small world of football coaching.
In Patterson's tenure as defensive coordinator and head coach (fol-
lowing the departure of his mentor, Dennis Franchione), the Horned
Frogs have won 103 regular season games in twelve years; they won
four consecutive bowl games from 2005 through '08 and crashed the
party of college football royalty; they have won with Texas talent and
with
all the organizational efficiency and passion any rising program
must have. They have also won with the 4-2-5 defense. It is but a distant
cousin to Dunn's 3-3-5, but it was founded on similar principles.
Patterson,
like
so many of his
peers, has
risen unglamorous-
ly through the coaching ranks:
Before landing
at TCU, he made
10 stops in 16 years at the likes of Tennessee Tech and Cal Lutheran.
He even coached a few months in 1992 in the quickly defunct Pro-
fessional Spring Football League with the Oregon Lightning Bolts.
He is a small-town football junkie from Rozel, Kans. (pop. 156), di-
vorced with three sons, now remarried. He plays a mean guitar. He
also earned his football degree on a tough road, playing two years
of strong safety and linebacker in junior college and two years as a
walk-on at Kansas State in '80 and '81 on teams that won six games
in those two seasons.
Here is a good example of how coaching alliances tend to form: During
Patterson's junior year at Kansas State, Dennis Franchione was a member
of coach Jim Dickey's staff; Dick Bumpas would join the staff in '81. Both
Bumpas and Patterson would work with Franchione at Tennessee Tech
in '83 and '84. In '88 Franchione hired Patterson to coach linebackers at
Pittsburg State University. Four years later, in the fall of 1992, Patterson
landed at Utah State, along with Bumpas.
The Aggies then played in the Big West Conference with the likes of
New Mexico State and UNLV. They played Brigham Young and Utah out
of the conference. In any given season they were going to see far more
passes than runs. Like Joe Lee Dunn nearly a decade earlier, Patterson
and Bumpas had to figure out how to stop the passing game.
"We had to develop, we had to change," says Patterson. "The pass-
ing game was changing everything. When Coach Bump and
I got to
Utah State with Charlie Weatherbie, that's when we really started do-
218

SPREAD STOPPERS
ing things differently." In the 4-4-3 Patterson and Bumpas used two
cornerbacks and one deep safety. In the Big West they went more often
to what would become the 4-2-5, with
five defensive backs instead
of three. As with Dunn's defense, three were strong-safety types, two
were corners. As with Jimmy Johnson's defense, the 4-2-5 put more
speedy athletes on the field, the better to play in space and attack the
passing game.
In Patterson's second year at Utah State the Aggies rebounded from
a 1-5 start to finish 7-5. After Utah State slipped to 3-8 the following
season, Patterson followed Weatherbie to Navy for a season. Franchione
then hired Patterson at New Mexico for '96 and '97 before getting the
TCU job and handing the defense to Patterson. Three years later coach
Fran was gone, and Patterson was in charge. In 2004 he brought Dick
Bumpas back as his coordinator. The Patterson-Bumpas alliance was
rejoined, and for the greater good of the Horned Frogs.
Patterson-has run the 4-2-5 for 12 years in Forth Worth. "It fits with
five-receiver offenses," says Patterson, "because you've already got five
defensive backs in the game." But
it has endured
its growing pains.
In 2004 Patterson's fourth year as head coach, Texas Tech, with Mike
Leach's precision spread, beat the Frogs 70-35 in Lubbock. Two years
later Tech returned the game in Fort Worth, and TCU held the high-
flying Red Raiders without a touchdown in a 12-3 victory. Patterson
and Bumpas aggressively zone-blitzed Tech out of the 4-2-5 and just as
aggressively mixed coverages behind the blitzes.
"Let me put it this way," says Leach. "I wasn't real impressed with Pat-
terson's 4-2-5 when we put 70 points on 'em. But I was pretty impressed
when they held us to three points. That doesn't happen too often."
It should be noted that the TCU team that gave up 70 points was a
5-6 team; the team that gave up three points was a much more talented
11-2 team. Both played the 4-2-5, but the better team played a more
evolved version. As any coach will remind you, the quality of the athletes
deeply influences the effectiveness of the system.
"A lot of people play the 4-2-5 now," says Patterson. "But nobody
runs it like we do. Over the years we've made changes. Our answer to
any offense used to be: We'll just blitz one more [defender] than you
can block. That's not our only answer anymore. We've evolved. We
219

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
can zone-blitz you out of a two-deep shell. We can zone-blitz you out
of a three-deep shell. We'll never leave ourselves in a single high free
safety. And we will always play with great leverage and speed."
Leverage
is a vital word in the lexicon of modern defense and es-
sential to the Patterson-Bumpas philosophy. Patterson explains leverage
in simple terms: "If [a TCU defender] starts deeper than [an offensive
player], you don't ever let him get deeper than you. If you start outside
someone, you don't let him get outside you. If you start inside, you don't
let him get inside you."
When Texas Tech scored those 10 touchdowns on TCU in '04, Patter-
son says his defense was unprepared for yet another leap of offensive
evolution. "The passing game changed again," Patterson says. "They
weren't just throwing
it a lot and spreading you out, but everybody
went to a three-step passing game. Three steps, pump fake, throw." Of-
fensive plays were suddenly unfolding more quickly. Filling space was
no longer sufficient in the 4-2-5; TCU had to close down that space
quickly and make sure tackles on receivers, or the yards-after-catch
would accrue like high interest. "We had to sit down [cover tightly] on
some routes; we had to zone-blitz a little more," says Patterson. "We
went out on the road in the spring and learned from other teams, and
we added everything. You've got to do that. You've got to leave your ego
at the door. Look, all of us as defensive coaches would like to just get
in our base defense and be better than the other team's offense. But of-
fenses are just too good.
"Here's the way I figure it," says Patterson. "Let's say an offense runs
60 plays, which is about average for a game. You're gonna need a better
call than them on about 30 of those plays. That takes a lot of work, a lot of
preparation, and every offense is different. Texas Tech plays the spread;
Air Force runs the option."
There is another factor. A common axiom in recruiting (and drafting)
is that teams select the best athletes and find a way to use them. Pat-
terson dismisses that thinking. He and Bumpas have been running the
4-2-5 for nearly two decades and know what it takes to play each posi-
tion in the scheme and play them well. They look for certain key quali-
ties, including versatility. For instance,
6' 3", 257-pound All-America
defensive end Jerry Hughes, a senior in 2009, had been a high school
220

SPREAD STOPPERS
tailback, quick and agile. "You recruit to fill a certain role," says Patter-
son. "You can't just grab athletes and hope they fit."
Modern defense is a game of survival.
It is rare to win by shutting
down an opponent, inconceivable to win by shutting down a dozen. As
a defensive coach, especially when, like Patterson, you're bouncing to
a new job almost every year, you learn to understand the realities. "All
you're trying to do is get the offense back in the huddle," says Patterson.
"Not kicking off."

DOUBLE A BLITZ VS. SLIDE PROTECT RIGHT
Popularized in the mid-2 ooos by the Philadelphia Eagles,
the DoubleA Gap blitzputs extraordinary pressure on the
offensive line andforcesprotection adjustments that limit
offensive possibilities. Two inside linebackers line up on either
side ofthe offensive center (in the A gaps'), both as ifpreparing
to blitz. Whether they actually blitz or not, the offense must
call aprotection change to block them, which can open up
other holesfor blitzersfrom other angles. In this diagram the
offensive line optsfor a "slideprotection" to its right to cover the
two linebackers, but it leaves itselfvulnerable to the backside
defensive end who gets afree run at the quarterback.
