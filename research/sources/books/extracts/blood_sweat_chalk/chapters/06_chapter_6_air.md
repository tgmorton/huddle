AIR
CORYELL
In the '60s, a squeaky-voiced coach decided there was
only one way to beat a better team: Throw like hell
Pasadena, Calif.
February 1, 1993
ORV TURNER woke up
on a Monday morning
in possession of a Super
Bowl title. As offensive
coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys he had called plays the previous night
in the Rose Bowl, guiding the Cowboys to a 52-17 rout of the Buffalo Bills.
Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman had thrown four touchdown passes to
three receivers and had been named the game's most valuable player.
The game would occupy an important place on the NFL time line: A sto-
ried franchise, and one of the league's most recognizable brand names, the
Cowboys had returned to greatness following a decade of mediocrity and just
three years after jarring change—most notably the ouster of beloved found-
ing head coach Tom Landry by new oilman owner Jerry Jones. The victory
would launch a minidynasty, as Dallas won three Super Bowls in four years.
The game was equally significant in another way. It had showcased Aik-
man and a Dallas passinggame thatwould become an NFL staple throughout
the '90s. On a warm California evening Aikman had peppered the Buffalo
defense with scoring passes: a 23-yard touchdown to tight end Jay Nova-
cek running straight up the middle of the Buffalo defense; a 19-yard slant
score to Michael Irvin slashing diagonally across the field; another 18-yard
touchdown to Irvin, planted at the right sideline; and, finally, a 45-yard
71

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
bomb to Alvin Harper, wide-open far beyond the deepest Buffalo defender.
In front of his TV at his home in San Francisco, former Chargers quar-
terback Dan Fouts had watched Aikman's precision like a man staring in a
mirror. On the morning after the game he called Turner, offered congratu-
lations and then said, "O.K., let me see if I got this right
" Fouts then
recited the play calls on each of Aikman's four touchdowns, as if he had
been standing in the Cowboys' huddle.
"Dan's on the phone, and he just runs down the calls," recalls Turner.
"He's like, 'The first touchdown was 370, right? Then the second one was
839? The third one looked to me like 787 special. And then the last one
was 989.' I can't remember the exact calls, but Dan remembered them back
then. Perfectly. He called every single play, exactly." On the phone Turner
had laughed out loud and Fouts laughed back, two men linked across time
by another man's lasting genius.
Fouts had been a 27-year-old quarterback for the Chargers in Sep-
tember of 1978 when team owner Eugene V. Klein forced head coach
Tommy Prothro's resignation and replaced him with a 53-year-old coach
named Don Coryell. He had built winners at San Diego State and with the
St. Louis Cardinals by installing an inventive, pass-first offensive system
that attacked defenses as few others had before it. Eight years later Turner,
who had come to the Los Angeles Rams from USC in 1985 as an offensive
assistant coach, found himself working under Ernie Zampese, who had
worked under Coryell with the Chargers. Fouts and Turner shared a pas-
sion for what came to be known simply as the Coryell offense, and they
shared a fluency in its language.
Fouts rode the Coryell offense into the Hall of Fame, directing the explo-
sive Chargers attack that redefined offense through the 1980s. Turner took
Coryell 101 to Dallas and taught it to Aikman and Irvin and the rest. There
were many other Coryell disciples, and there would be many more in the
years that followed, all because a former Army paratrooper turned football
coach got sick of losing two games a year to deeper teams while coaching at
San Diego State in the 1960s. So he built an offense that combined techni-
cal simplicity with daring downfield strikes written into almost every play.
Pass routes were numbered in a basic 1 through 9 ladder. Quarterbacks
were instructed to read from deep to short and to get rid of the ball quick-
ly. Formations with four wide receivers became common, and eventually,
72

AIR CORYELL
players in motion became routine. On defense, an entire sport backpedaled.
Mike Martz watched Coryell's San Diego State teams while he was
playing tight end at San Diego Mesa (Junior) College in the late 1960s. ("I
pictured myself playing for Don, but I wasn't good enough," says Martz.)
Three decades later, in 1999, Martz became offensive coordinator of the
St. Louis Rams and directed an explosive offense to the Super Bowl title.
Because they played home games indoors on artificial grass, the Rams
came to be called The Greatest Show on Turf, but in truth it was just the
Coryell offense, evolved. During the height of the Rams' success, Martz
met up with Coryell, and the two were photographed together. Martz
later sent the photo to Coryell with the following inscription:
Coach Coryell, we are allgrateful toyouforyour impact on the game.
You changed itforever.
.
.
. the 'Godfather' of today's passing game.
"And he is exactly that," says Martz. "He was way ahead of everyone in
terms of innovation. There was this unspoken set of rules that you played
by on offense. And everyone was running generally the same kind of
plays. The formations were the same. The concepts were the same. Cory-
ell changed all that. People immediately said, 'You can't do that.' Well, you
can do that, and he did it. His whole approach to the game was different.
He was going to beat you with the ball at any time. He had this aggressive
mind-set. He was always attacking the defense, never going into this con-
servative mode where you try to win through attrition. And that's where
football was at that time in history. Now, 40 years later, you're seeing the
second and third generations of coaches running Coryell's system."
The recent history of the NFL is rich with success descended from the
Coryell offense. Zampese won with it in Los Angeles. Joe Gibbs, who played
for Coryell at San Diego State and also coached under him, took the play-
book to Washington, expanded it and won three Super Bowls. Turner took it
to Dallas, then Washington, then San Diego. Martz turned the league upside
down in St. Louis. Jason Garrett (Aikman's erstwhile backup) called Coryell's
plays into Tony Romo's helmet as the Cowboys' offensive coordinator. Play-
ers have been made famous by running signature patterns in the offense: Ir-
vin on the Bang 8 slant; Jay Novacek, then Marshall Faulk and most recently
Antonio Gates on the F post.

By the start of the 2008 NFL season, there was scarcely a team in the
league that didn't incorporate some piece of the Coryell passing game into
its offense, whether by the numbering of pass routes or spacing concepts or
individual plays. By 2010 several teams—most notably Baltimore, Dallas, San
Diego and San Francisco—relied almost exclusively on the Coryell offense.
"Ifyou brought Don Coryell to Dallas and handed him our playbook," said
Garrett in the fall of 2007, "without ever having watched one of our practices
or games, he would still recognize an awful lot of stuff in that book."
Puget Sound, Wash.
March 2008
THE WORD coming through the football pipeline was that Don Coryell,
83 years old, had become a recluse, living a quiet life far from the main-
stream, resistant to questioners and in poor health. Some of this, it turns
out, is true: Coryell resides far from the noise of Sunday afternoons and
has done few interviews in recent years. He has slowed with age. But he
is not a recluse. It's just that inquisitors must go to him, and even in a
world made small, that is not easy.
It is a 66-mile drive north on Interstate 5 from Seattle to Burlington,
and then 16 miles west on Route 20 from Burlington to Anacortes, a stag-
ing point for many of the ferries that service the San Juan Islands float-
ing at the nexis of Washington State, Canada's Vancouver Island and the
Olympic Peninsula. From a pier in Anacortes, one boat stops first at Lopez
Island and then continues on 20 minutes later to Friday Harbor, a village
of 2,200 year-round residents, the only incorporated town on San Juan
Island, the second largest in the chain. A late-model SUV slows to a stop
along Front Street, parallel to the shoreline, with Coryell at the wheel.
The old coach wears a heavy fleece pullover, baggy sweat-style pants and
walking shoes. A baseball cap covers thin gray hair, his blue eyes are full of
vigor. He is slender in the manner of a former athlete, but he also explains
that a recent knee replacement has left him hobbling, and he has a set of
hiking poles in the backseat to prove it. The ride is 25 minutes over rolling,
pastoral hills and sweeping roadway curves from downtown Friday Harbor
to Coryell's home across the island, a three-story natural wood house over-
looking a peaceful, horseshoe-shaped inlet called Neil Bay. Coryell and his
74

AIR CORYELL
wife, Aliisa (who died in December 2008), bought the home while he was
still coaching in the NFL; he now lives there year-round.
The drive across the island is plenty long enough for Coryell to unfurl the
story of his life: raised in Seattle, played football at Lincoln High School, en-
listed in the Army in 1943 and spent 3/2 years as a paratrooper. He returned
to Seattle and the University ofWashington in the fall of 1946 and played de-
fensive back for the Huskies. "I wasn't good enough to play offense," he says.
"Even on defense, I think I started one game, and that was in my senior year."
He also began sliding, almost accidentally, toward his calling.
"I started out as a forestry major," says Coryell. "I wanted to be a forest
ranger. But there was a lot of science, and there was no way I could get
through all that science. So I withdrew before I flunked out and switched
over to physical education." He graduated in the spring of 1950, and af-
ter getting a master's degree from Washington in physical education, em-
barked on what was another of those classic coaching odysseys: two years
at high schools in Hawaii, two years as head coach at the University of
British Columbia, a year at Wenatchee Valley College in Washington State,
a year coaching a military team at Fort Ord in Northern California; three
years as head coach at Whittier College in suburban L.A. and a year on John
McKay's staff at USC before taking over at San Diego State in 1961.
At every stop Coryell tinkered. "You look at your players, and you fig-
ure out what the hell they can do," he says. Coryell had been a single
wing quarterback in high school. In 1955 Wenatchee's lone outstanding
running back was injured during the preseason. "We took one of our full-
backs and put him at tailback. The other fullback played fullback, right
in front of the halfback. We called it our hash marks offense because we'd
use it on the hash marks and put the other halfback to the wide side. For
us, it was backs-left and backs-right."
Football historians call it something else: The power I. It would come
to dominate college football in the 1970s (including at USC, where Coryell
had worked with McKay). As with so many football creations, its precise
origins are unclear. It might have been Frank Leahy at Notre Dame in the
early 1950s or Tom Nugent at Virginia Military Institute in the middle of
the decade who first ran the formation. But Coryell was certainly one of its
pioneers, and Wenatchee went from winless to unbeaten in one season.
At Whittier he endlessly ran the power
I, yet he remained fascinated
75

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
with the possibility of expanding his offense and read a book by TCU ath-
letic director and coach Dutch Meyer titled Spread Formation Football. In
his third year at Whittier, Coryell moved a tailback to quarterback, spread
out his wide receivers and began throwing passes.
Whittier went 23-5-1 in Coryell's three years. After his one season at USC
he was hired to salvage football at San Diego State, winner ofjust seven games
in the previous four seasons. Coryell made the Aztecs better immediately,
winning 38 games in his first five seasons. Yet they also lost two games a
year, and it was those losses that galled Coryell. "Two games, every goddam
year," he says. He was scouring California junior colleges for players who had
escaped the grasp of USC and UCLA, but still San Diego State usually found
itself with a talent deficit against major-college programs. But not a skill defi-
cit. Coryell concluded that the best way to win was to make full use of quar-
terbacks and wide receivers and beat more complete teams with the pass.
"I just decided, hell, you can't just go out and run the ball against better
teams," he says. "You've got to mix it up. You've got to throw the damn ball
if you're going to beat better teams. So we started throwing the ball."
Joe Gibbs played at San Diego State during Coryell's first three seasons
and was an assistant coach for the next three. "When
I first came there
in 1961," Gibbs says, "Don was a killer running coach. I formation, power
running. Just killer. But then
it's amazing the transition that took place.
Don switched to throwing it like mad, and he was very creative. He was not
afraid to try anything."
Over the next six seasons San Diego State was 55-9-1, becoming a national
phenomenon, forcing recognition by pounding nonelite opponents, but forc-
ing fans and media to wonder just how good they might be. "USC or UCLA
might be wise to steer clear of the Aztecs," wrote SPORTS ILLUSTRATED in
October 1966. SDSU sometimes drew more fans than the Chargers, who
were then a power in the American Football League. Among Coryell's as-
sistant coaches were Gibbs, Zampese and John Madden.
The recognition all came on the wings of the passing game, though the
conversion was gradual: In 1961, Coryell's first year, San Diego State quar-
terbacks threw a total of 124 passes; three years later it was 250. In 1964, se-
nior Rod Dowhower (later head coach at Stanford and with the Indianapolis
Colts) led a passing attack that accounted for 2,083 yards (nearly double the
'61 total). Junior flanker Gary Garrison (who would become an AFL Ail-Star
76

AIR CORYELL
with the Chargers) caught 78 passes in '64 and 70 more from Don Horn a
year later, with a total of 26 touchdowns. Haven Moses, Ken Burrow and
Isaac Curtis would follow Garrison's tracks into pro football. At quarterback,
Dennis Shaw followed Horn, and Brian Sipe followed Shaw; all played in the
NFL, as did at least two dozen other of Coryell's San Diego State players.
That was just the beginning. Coryell would guide the St. Louis Cardinals
to two divisional titles in the brutal NFC East and the Chargers to two divi-
sional championships in the AFC West. So how, exactly, did he do it?
ON THAT chilly winter afternoon in 2008 Coryell sits at the dining table
in his waterfront home, ignoring a fruit and cheese plate as he becomes
absorbed
in
explaining
his
offense. From
a canvas shopping bag he
pulls a thick, three-ring binder, a small index card affixed to the front:
SAN DIEGO CHARGERS: 1979. "Right here," Coryell says, smacking the
front of the binder with his right hand, the one adorned with a ring from
the College Football Hall of Fame. "This is how we did it."
Football historians often point out that Coryell created his modern, ef-
fective game at the same time Sid Gillman was coaching the Chargers and
using a daring air offense with quarterback John Hadl and receivers Lance
Alworth and Garrison. It has been suggested, more than once, that Coryell
devised his offense after watching Gillman's. Coryell says it's not so. "Sid
Gillman threw it down the field, and I probably watched Sid's teams," says
Coryell. Then he smacks the binder again. "But this is our stuff."
Coryell's offensive system is based on three elements: simplicity, spac-
ing and timing.
It is unclear which early sideline mavens first used numbers, rather than
names, to identify pass routes. What is unquestioned is that Coryell's num-
bering system has been the most enduring and efficient. The foundation:
Routes for the outside receivers in a formation (typically designated the X
and Z receivers) are assigned single digits, from 1 to 9; routes for an inside
(or Y) receiver are assigned multiples of 10, from 10 to 90. A basic pass play
might begin with the number 837, which means the outside X receiver runs
an 8 route, the inside Y receiver runs a 30, and the outside Z receiver runs a 7.
Coryell flips through pages in the binder until he arrives at a page en-
titled "Routes for X and Y." Half the page is filled with a basic diagram
showing half an offensive line and a single wide receiver. A series of lines
77

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
emanates from the lone wideout, each one numbered. Below the diagram
is a key, with a description of each route, in intricate detail. The numbering
system would become not only intrinsic to the offensive language of the
sport but also to the lexicon of the broadcast booth.
Here are some examples, for the X and Z receivers, which can be split
ends or flankers: A 1 route is a basic out. A 2 is a hard slant. A 6 is a curl. An
8 (or a "Bang 8," with which Aikman and Irvin would get rich and famous
in Dallas) is a skinny post. A 9 is a go route, or fly pattern.
The route descriptions are precise. For instance, from the list of routes for
the Y receiver, which can be a slot player, tight end or running back, a 20 is
explained like this: "Release inside and sprint across field aiming for 7 YD
depth on the other side of formation." This is essentially what became know
as a "drag" route, or in the West Coast offense (Chapter 8), a "drive" route.
Coryell created the numbering system for two reasons. The first is that
it was easy to learn quickly. At San Diego State, Coryell relied so heavily on
junior college players, who would only be available to him for two seasons,
that quick study was a necessity. "You can get a guy and teach him the
whole thing in two days," says Coryell.
Cam Cameron, who learned the system as Turner's quarterbacks coach
with the Redskins, says, "At the NFL level, one of the highest compliments
you can give the system is that you can bring new guys in on Tuesday and
they can play on Sunday."
The second reason—a key explanation for the longevity of the Coryell
system—is that the numbering system
is
visual, rather than cognitive.
Whereas many prior, and subsequent, offensive systems would give each
play a word name (Cowboy or Maverick or some such), the backbone of
every Coryell play is a two- or three-digit number that doesn't just name the
play but also describes what the play will look like. A play with the number
335 shows that the X receiver is running a deep out (3), the Z receiver is
running a comeback (5) and the Y receiver is also running a deep out (30).
Even in the Coryell system, further word and letter additions are neces-
sary to describe formations and routes for the running backs (labeled H
and F), as in Scat (formation) 435 F Cross (an inside crossing route by a
running back). But every play is built from the foundation of the digits.
"It was always a great thing for me," says quarterback Trent Green, who
played in the Coryell system for Turner in Washington and later for Mike
78

AIR CORYELL
Martz in St. Louis. "The first thing I do when a play comes into my headset
is visualize it. In this system, with every play call, you're actually telling ev-
erybody what to do by what you say. Instead of saying, 'I Right Omaha,' or
something like that, you're saying, 'R 428 H Stop,' and that tells everybody
what to do, instead of relying on their memorization of something."
As Joe Gibbs puts it, "Using Don's offense, you felt like the quarterback
had a picture in his mind of what was going to happen. If everybody in the
huddle shut their eyes, they could all see the play, much more than just
learning a name by rote."
Jason Garrett, who installed the system as coordinator of the Cowboys in
2007, says, "To me, there was so much simplicity in the way it's taught and
the way it's learned. And that goes back to the three-digit system of digitiz-
ing the routes. Putting the whole passing game together is just a matter of
putting the numbers together. It all flows so naturally."
The spacing element of the Coryell offense—in which every route is
designed to maximize distance receivers, making them more difficult to
cover—has its roots in the Dutch Meyer book that Coryell studied. "It's one
of the huge keys to the entire offense—the spacing is just so important,"
says quarterback Kurt Warner, who operated the system for the Rams. "It's
so emphasized to all the receivers: Get off the ball and get downfield, get
great separation between your deep route and your six- to eight-yard route.
The entire offense is very precise, and it comes down to spacing more than
anything else, spreading out the defense." If the Coryell system is executed
properly, as with any spread-style offense, defenders are forced to cover
huge chunks of earth to blanket receivers.
The final component was timing; from the early days Coryell harped
on the wedding of speed and precision. "We put a timing element on every
one of the routes," says Zampese. "Say we were asking the X receiver to run
a 1 route. We would tell the guy, 'Three steps, and when your third inside
foot hits the ground, that's when you break! Just go ahead and change
direction. No fakes, just timing. Third inside foot and break.' And the key
was to run as fast as you can. Which we forced these guys to do. We told
them not to round off their cuts, but we had them running the routes so
fast that they had to round them off a little bit."
Just as important was the speed of the quarterback. Anyone who has
played in the Coryell system can still hear an assistant coach—Zampese,
79

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Turner, Cameron, Garrett—screaming in a quarterback's ear as he drops
back from the center: Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!
"Urgency is
critical," says Garrett. "If I heard Norv Turner and Ernie
Zampese say it once to the wide receivers, I heard them say it 500,000 times:
'Run off the ball! Run off the ball! Get out ofyour stance and get going! ' And it
applies to the quarterback. 'Get out! Get away from the center! Get your back
foot down and get rid of the ball!' Can you teach a guy this? I don't know, but
I'll tell you this: It's going to be ground into the head of any guy running this
system. Bang, bang, bang! Get the ball out. Over and over again."
The most obvious "Gillmanesque" quality in Coryell's system is its every-
down homage to the deep ball, the way Sid liked to play. Nearly every play
in Coryell's book includes some sort of downfield option, and quarterbacks
are taught to read plays from deep to short—whereas many offenses read
short to deep or some sort of other predesigned progression. "On Don's pass
routes, normally there were three different parts to the route," says Gibbs.
"And there's always a deep portion. And you'd have a medium portion and
a short checkdown. Don's reads [for the quarterback] would always start
with the deep shot, so you didn't have to guess and gamble by calling a
specific deep shot. It was already there, built into all the routes."
Coryell drilled two other credos into his quarterbacks' heads: 1) "Never
pass up an open receiver. If he's there, stop reading and throw it to him."
2) "Never, ever worry about an incompletion. You don't give a damn about
incompletions. Just go back and get it the next time."
When Coryell arrived in St. Louis in 1973, his first move was to re-
store 29-year-old, eight-year veteran Jim Hart as the starting quarterback.
Hart was the classic Coryell QB: durable and decisive, with a quick re-
lease. "Don came into St. Louis and looked at film on Jim Hart," says Jim
Hanifan, who came to the Cardinals with Coryell from San Diego State.
"Jimmy had been sitting on the bench. Don looked at the film and said,
'Screw that. This is my quarterback.' "
Coryell gave Hart one order: "Don't get hit." (Translation: Get rid of the
ball.) The Cardinals took a year to master Coryell's system and then won
31 games in three years, including two divisional titles. Coryell expanded
his offense, adding multiple formations and putting in several screen pass-
es to best utilize his speedy little running back, Terry Metcalf. In 1974 and
'76 Hart led the NFC in touchdown passes.
80

AIR CORYELL
"Back in those years," says Hanifan, "a lot of teams would just sit back
on defense and Don would feast on them. So they started to bring pres-
sure, and Don would just say, 'We are not going to let this happen. We're
going to attack.'
Gibbs, also a Coryell assistant in St. Louis, says, "I'd be up in the press
box calling plays, and Don would grab the headset and he'd say, 'Let's start
getting after their butts!' Usually that means pound it down their throats,
but with Don it meant 'Let's start throwing it.' Not running it on them, get-
ting after them by throwing it."
Four games into the 1978 season, the Chargers hired Coryell as head
coach. Coryell, who had returned to San Diego after the Cardinals let him
go (St. Louis's owner got antsy after a 7-7 season in '77), was introduced
to the Charger players on the morning of Monday, Sept. 25, 1978, one day
after a 24-3 loss to Green Bay, the team's third consecutive defeat. More
eerily, it was also the day on which 144 people were killed when a Pacific
Southwest Airlines 727 jet collided over San Diego with a Cessna 172.
Dan Fouts picks up the story: "It was such a strange day. There is this
huge disaster in the city. Then there's a team meeting. We're 1-3 at this
point and going nowhere. Just got crushed by Green Bay, and we were aw-
ful. So they fire Prothro, and he talks to us, and then he walks out of the
room. Now, our team was pathetic under Prothro, but he was this big, im-
posing Southern gentleman. And right after he walks out, in walks Don,
and he's this smaller guy with a funny voice. (To this day, anyone who has
known Coryell can imitate his urgent, nasal inflection.)
"Don stands up there," says Fouts, "and he says, 'People think I'm crazy
to take this job. I'm still getting paid by the St. Louis Cardinals. And I'm sit-
ting up on that hill, getting paid for doing nothin'. But I'm a little bit crazy.
I'm crazy enough to turn this thing around.' And we're all just looking at
each other, and I'm thinking, Holy shit, what a refreshing attitude. It was a
breath of fresh air. And from that point on, we were just ready to take off."
Coryell recalls, "Gene Klein told me, 'I hired you to throw the football.
Now throw it.' I said, 'That's a damn good idea.' "
It would be the true birth of what came to be known far and wide as Air
Coryell. For one season Coryell moved conservatively, but the Chargers won
seven of their last eight games to finish at 9-7. In the off-season, Coryell
brought in Gibbs and his old buddy Zampese. Fouts was already positioned
81

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
as the quarterback, and wide receiver Charlie Joiner had come by way of a
trade from the Cincinnati Bengals in '76. Wideout John Jefferson had been
the team's first pick in the '78 draft, and in the spring of '79 Coryell would
take 6' 5", 251-pound tight end Kellen Winslow, a transcendent athlete from
the University of Missouri.
What transpired was a splendid blend of players and system. Joiner was a
brilliant, cerebral pass receiver, perfectly suited to an offense in which receiv-
ers had to make decisions based on how they were played by defensive backs.
"I learned more from Joiner than he learned from me," says Zampese. Win-
slow was a wideout in a tight end's body. "If you put him in the conventional
tight end position, linebackers would just pound him every time," says Gibbs.
"So what we did is, we started moving him, putting him on the move and
getting him spread out so they couldn't hammer him. And then they couldn't
cover him, either." And Fouts had the unflagging courage to set, stand and
throw, and then to take the pounding that inevitably followed.
To a system already revolutionary in its spreads and routes, Coryell now
added motion and screens and more formations every day. Weekday game-
planning sessions took on a giddy aura.
"Let's say it's a Wednesday," says Fouts. "It's nine o'clock in the morning,
and they're putting up the plays that we're going to run against this week's
team. Joe Gibbs would say, 'O.K., here's the way they read motion by the tight
end, so we're going to run this play against it, and here's why it will work.' And
he would do that with the whole game plan, and we walk out of the meeting
and we've already won the game. Wednesday was a better day than Sunday.
"For me," he continues, "it came down to a feeling that I can't be wrong.
If I got through my progression, if I do what I've been told by the coaching
staff, we'll have a good play. And not only that, we've got a chance to make
a big play on every snap. It was just a total confidence in every play that was
called. You know how many times I audibled in 10 years? Maybe once or
twice. Maybe. And I would get in the huddle on the first series on Sunday,
and I'd just say, 'O.K., boys, 40 today.' Or, '50 today.'
There was, always, a quirkiness to Coryell. He had that odd voice, for
starters, and he had a piercing focus that often disarmed his colleagues—or
made them laugh. Gibbs recalls once poking his head into Coryell's office,
only to find the room in nearly total darkness, with Coryell sitting at his
desk, scribbling terminology by the glow of a tiny desk light. On one morn-
82

AIR CORYELL
ing Coryell climbed into his car for the drive to work after putting the fam-
ily's garbage cans into the trunk, planning to leave them at the bottom of
the driveway for the trash collectors. Before he put the car in gear, his mind
had turned to football, and he arrived at work with the cans
still in the
trunk, where they fermented throughout the day in the sunshine. "It was
funny," says Gibbs. "But his ability to focus was phenomenal."
Over the next four seasons the Chargers went 39-18 and twice played in
the AFC Championship Game. They led the NFL in passing offense for six
consecutive years beginning in 1978. Fouts passed for more than 4,000 yards
each year from '79 to '81, including what were at the time the two highest
totals in NFL history, long before such numbers became commonplace.
Signature plays emerged from the weekly brainstormings. Joiner caught
213 passes for 3,328 yards from '79 to '81, almost exclusively on crossing
routes in the middle of the soft zone defenses that were typical in those years.
"Charlie wasn't very fast, and neither was I," says Fouts. "But my drop-back
and his routes seemed to just time out perfectly. There were times with Char-
lie, because I played with him for so long, that if you measured his heartbeat
and my heartbeat, I'll bet you'd find they were just about the same."
A single play dominated the offense: F Post. There were dozens of varia-
tions, called endlessly, first by Gibbs and then by Zampese, who dialed up
the F Post so often that throughout the NFL in later years it became known
simply as an "Ernie route."
The most common call was 525 F Post Swing. Both outside receivers
would run 15-yard outside comeback routes, carrying the corners to the
outside. The Y receiver would run a 20, or a shallow cross, occupying the
vision of the linebackers and safeties. The F receiver—sometimes a running
back, sometimes a second tight end, depending on the formation—would
then run an option post route, finding his own open path. A running back
would run a short swing pattern. "It got to be an unbelievable play, the best
play in the whole system," says Zampese. "And they still run it."

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
BANG 8 (THE SKINNY POST)
The Dal/as Cowhoys ofthe '90s took one ofthe most simple and
basic ofpassplays and, with endlesspractice and repetition, honed
it into a quick-hitting, surefire offensive weapon. Quarterback
Troy Aikman (8) took afive-step dropfrom center. Wide receiver
Michael Irvin (88) ran a skinny—or acutely angled—post
pattern (an "8" route in the original Coryell numbering system)
while reading the cornerbacks movement and timing his cut based
on the coverage. As soon asAikmans backfoot hit the ground, he
released the throw to Irvin. It was an almost unstoppableplay.
