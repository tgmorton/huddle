ZONE
BLOCKING
It's all the rage in the modern running game, but don't try to
tell an old hard-core offensive line coach it's a revolution
field at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. They had gone through
a light session under a rising morning sun; a much more stressful after-
noon workout would follow, under more painful conditions. No energy
was wasted as players walked slowly off the artificial turf onto the asphalt
path that led to air conditioning, medical treatment and food. It was eerily
quiet, except for the occasional Colts fan beseeching an autograph. And, of
course, the ear-splitting engine noise when 67-year-old offensive line coach
Howard Mudd roared off the field in a four-wheel all-terrain vehicle.
Golf carts are everywhere at a pro football practice, with all manner of
support personnel scooting about; small flatbed tractors are common too,
for transporting tackling dummies, Gatorade buckets and, on bad days,
injured players. But Mudd has raised the vehicular bar, tearing around
the Colts' camp in an open-top roadster that looks as if it belongs in some
sort of extreme sports competition. "When we finish talking," says Mudd,
"I'll get this thing up to speed for you. We can even go back on the trails,
if you're interested. There are some great trails around here."
If Mudd were not a real '60s-vintage professional football player drag-

ging his wounded body into old age with little complaint, he could play one
on television. He has the barrel chest and broad shoulders of a faded offen-
sive lineman, a middle gone soft over the years, a right knee swollen and
scarred grotesquely by no fewer than three total knee replacements. His
face is leathery and reddened by four decades of training-camp summers;
a gray-and-white beard finishes the package with a professorial touch that
is fully appropriate given his standing in the O-line community.
Mudd, who grew up in Midland, Mich., played on the offensive line
at Hillsdale College from I960 through '63, then spent nine seasons in
the old school NFL trenches: six with the San Francisco 49ers, three
with the Chicago Bears. He played in three Pro Bowls but went out in
'71 with a knee injury that still hounds him today.
He coached offensive linemen at the University of California in his
first two years out of the NFL and took his first coaching job in pro foot-
ball at the age of 32, with the 1974 San Diego Chargers. He has been in
the league ever since and has spent more time watching large men's back-
sides than most people spend watching television. He knows blocking.
In the language of football, certain terms become part of the ver-
nacular overnight, or seem to. "Zone blocking scheme," and
its rel-
atives
"inside zone
play" and
"outside zone
play," have suddenly
become ubiquitous, often exalted as something brand-new. Yet there
has been considerable commentary in the coaching community—some
of it downright dismissive— as to whether there is anything at all new
about zone blocking. Hell hath no fury like an old coach being told that
a thing is new when he's been watching it for decades. Zone blocking
is one of those things.
Jim Hanifan, who coached NFL offensive lines in the 1970s, '80s
and '90s (and was head coach of the
St. Louis Cardinals from '80
through '85), says, "I get a kick out of people saying zone blocking is
something new. Yeah, it's new all right.
It's only been around for 50
years or more.
It's part of the game. Some people are acting like
it's
part of a revolution. Bullshit!"
Hanifan played at the University of California in the early-to-mid-
1950s and shortly afterward coached high school football in California for
seven seasons. "And I coached zone blocking there," he says. "We've been
using it forever." Hanifan's insistence—shared by almost every old school
126

ZONE BLOCKING
O-line guru in the sport—grows from the hazy definition of the term. It
sounds simple enough: zone blocking. Different from man-to-man block-
ing. But, of course, it's more complicated than that.
"Zone blocking has always been there," Mudd says. "Maybe people
called
it something else, but
it's always been part of the game." Here
Mudd becomes the teacher. He is sitting in his turbo golf cart in the glare
of summer, but he might as well be in a classroom, writing on a white-
board with a grease pencil. He grabs his "pupil's" notebook and pen and
begins sketching diagrams to explain what it is and to postulate on its
heritage. In football evolution, few areas are grayer than zone blocking.
But let Mudd explain the basics:
"Man blocking is just what is sounds like," he says. "You've got one
man blocking another man. When the play gets called in the huddle, the
offensive player has an assignment, to block a particular player on the
other team. That's man-to-man blocking, and you really don't see a lot
of that anymore. Zone blocking, well, in the simplest terms, the offen-
sive players are blocking an area. Instead of trying to block a particular
player and move him to a particular place, they're blocking whatever is
in front of them."
Anthony Munoz, an integral part of the man-to-man blocking scheme
that fueled USC's famous sweeps, would later play left tackle on the
'80s Cincinnati Bengals teams that brought zone blocking into the NFL
mainstream. "Think of it this way," says Munoz. "If you're man block-
ing, you've got this guy across from you, number 71. You're job is to
block him. That's your man. Zone blocking, you're on a track, like a rail-
road track, with your buddy, or all your buddies on the offensive line. If
a defensive lineman or a linebacker crosses onto the track, your job is to
take him and move him."
As the offensive linemen, working in unison, take advantage of the
defenders' own momentum, the running back, following, reads those
blocks before finding his seam and hitting it. The best thing about zone
blocking schemes," Munoz continues, "is that it doesn't matter what the
defense is doing. You can use your strength and your power to your ad-
vantage. You can say, 'Let's not see where the defense wants to move to;
let's dictate where they go by where we move along that track and then
use their movement against them to create seams.' "

The concepts of zone blocking have, indeed, been a part of football
since the turn of the 20th century. (And, arguably, before that; after all,
the flying wedge was technically a zone blocking play, albeit with inter-
locked limbs. A group of players, arm-in-arm, ran up the field plowing
over anything in their way, without regard to any personal blocking as-
signment.) Pop Warner's single wing was rooted in double teams and
trap blocking rather than pure body-on-body blocking. Tubby Raymond's
Delaware wing T was also built on a foundation of traps and team blocks
or "buddy blocks."
Among the first mainstream college coaches to effectively use the mod-
ern concepts of zone blocking was Bill Yeoman at Houston. It was Yeoman
who began running the veer in 1965, using what were essentially zone
blocking techniques, even if they weren't called that at the time, for more
than a decade. And through the '70s and '80s, at both the college and
the NFL level, as defenses became so much more sophisticated—linemen
slanting and stunting in ever more unpredictable ways—it became nearly
impossible for an offensive lineman to simply block the man across the
line because often that man wasn't rushing directly at him. Offenses
needed some way to counteract these more elaborate defenses.
HOWARD MUDD arrived in Cleveland in 1983 to work as the Browns'
offensive line coach under Sam Rutigliano. The Browns went 9-7 in that
first year and won just one of their first nine games in '84; Rutigliano was
fired and replaced by defensive coordinator Marty Schottenheimer, an
old-school former AFL linebacker who would build a successful coaching
career on the philosophy that the best way to win was to use the running
game to pound the football. For the '85 season he charged Mudd with
rebuilding the Browns' offense into a power running machine.
Mudd will not take credit for inventing the NFL version of zone block-
ing. He says the Seattle Seahawks, where he coached from 1978 through
'82 under Jack Patera, had been using a few zone blocking plays. That
surely helped shape Mudd's thinking as he worked up his run game for
the '85 season. There was another influence too. When Mudd played for
the 49ers, one of the team's running backs was John David Crow (Heis-
man Trophy winner at Texas A&M in '57), near the end of his impressive
11-year NFL career. Mudd and Crow would later coach together with the
128

ZONE BLOCKING
San Diego Chargers in the mid '70s, and Mudd picked Crow's brain about
how running backs find holes.
Says Mudd, "One day I said to John David, 'What do you look at when
you're hitting the hole?' I asked him because we were always telling run-
ning backs, 'Look at the butt of the blocker you're following.' So
I won-
dered if that's what they actually did. John said,
'I'll tell you what: I'm
not lookin' at [the blocker]. I'm looking at that sumbitch that's gonna
hurt me.' Well, that really helped me because then
I realized that run-
ning backs aren't watching offensive linemen, they're watching defend-
ers. That's a big difference."
For Mudd
this signaled a change:
Instead of assigning
specific
blockers to open specific holes, why not try to have the entire offensive
line work as a flowing team, creating movement in the defense and
letting the holes open up wherever they opened and letting the run-
ning back see them. "I was thinking, Let's cover up their color with our
color," says Mudd, "and then encourage the ballcarrier to run toward
the defense and then go where they aren't going. Hit 'em where they
ain't, you could say."
Everybody
in
football
in the 1980s had played—or coached—the
wing T at some point in his career, Mudd included. He started there. "The
wing T is built on principles of the double-team block up front," says
Mudd. "So with Cleveland in 1985, what we installed was a system where
we tried to double-team at the point of attack, and as soon as the double
team is engaged, we would come off and get the 'backer on the second
level." This would become the bedrock of the modern zone scheme: flow,
double-team and release to the second level.
There was also a bonus. "Zone blocking
is easier to teach," Mudd
says. "There are fewer things that can go wrong because you're creating
this mush, where guys are working with the guy next to him and there's
just less space for things to go wrong. Now, with this, of course, you're
going to lose some of the techniques that
I grew up with—the angle
blocking and pulling. But it's just easier. Over the years I've been in so
many meetings where we said, 'Ah, hell, let's just zone-block
it.' And
that's what we did.
Another concept became apparent. Whereas running backs in the
old man-to-man blocking system would generally accelerate at the
129

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
snap and receive the ball—by toss or handoff—while running at full
speed, zone blocking schemes called for more patience.
"It became
important for the ballcarrier to have speed through the hole, not speed
to the hole," says Mudd.
The 1985 Browns started four offensive linemen who had not been reg-
ulars in the previous season. They also started second-year man Earnest
Byner at tailback and rookie Kevin Mack at fullback, and each rushed for
more than 1,000 yards, the only double-thousand backfield in the NFL. A
year later the rushing numbers dipped, but with Bernie Kosar at quarter-
back, the Browns reached the AFC Championship Game (losing to John
Elway and the Broncos on "The Drive") and eventually strung together
three straight double-digit-win seasons.
THE LEAGUE was watching. In Cincinnati 42-year-old Jim McNally was
half a decade into his first NFL coaching job, handling the offensive
line for head coach Sam Wyche. McNally, who would become one of the
most respected O-line coaches in the game, already had anchors at left
tackle (Munoz) and right guard (Max Montoya). In '86 he started imple-
menting Mudd's zone system with the Bengals. "Howard Mudd really
ran one play, an off-tackle play, exceptionally well with a zone scheme,"
says McNally. "We copied that play and ran it a little wider, starting with
[running back] James Brooks."
In fairness to McNally, it's not as if he'd been sleeping on the sideline
for five years. He had seen the defenses increasingly attacking gaps in
the offense, making
it more difficult to block for a traditional man-to-
man running game. "When defensive lines started to pinch and slant,"
says McNally, "you'd get a situation where a [defensive end, or tackle in a
3-4 alignment] would line up over your tackle and he would slant to the
inside. Well, your guard is firing out to get the linebacker, and the slant-
ing defender would pick him off." That would kill the play, often letting a
linebacker shoot the gap untouched.
McNally's answer was to have his linemen take a step backward with
one foot—counterintuitive to everything linemen had been previously
taught—and then launch into a series of lateral double teams. In the sum-
mer of 1986 McNally introduced two movements to his offensive line: the
"drop step" and the "bucket step."
130

ZONE BLOCKING
Munoz was part of those early practice field sessions and recalls, "Peo-
ple were asking, 'How can you run-block when you're taking a step back-
ward?' I remember a couple years later, the Rams were putting in a zone
blocking system, and [Hall of Fame tackle] Jackie Slater called me and
said, 'Anthony, they want me to start by going backward! I want to fire out
and hit somebody.' I told him that's the beauty of the drop step and bucket
step. Once you learn to do them properly, you're stepping backward to get
your hips in position to move, but your shoulders are moving forward.
When everybody takes that same step and gets moving on that track, you
look like a bunch of dancing bears. But it's effective."
It took two seasons for the Bengals to become
efficient with the
scheme. James Brooks rushed for 1,087 yards in '86, and the Bengals
went 10-6. A year later they slipped to 4-11 in a strike-interrupted sea-
son, but in '88 the Bengals were an offensive machine. Brooks, a 5' 10",
180-pound scatback from Auburn, rushed for another 931 yards, but
it was rookie Ickey Woods, a 6' 2", 231-pound battering ram, who ex-
ploded behind McNally's dancing bears.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick says, "To be a great running back in the
NFL, you've got to be a truly instinctive runner." Woods, for one season,
was truly that: He had superb instincts for following the nascent zone
blocking, seeing and feeling the seams and bursting through the hole (as
Mudd would have it). Woods rolled up 1,066 yards, 5.6 yards every time
he touched the ball. The Bengals led the NFL with 2,710 yards on the
ground, nearly 200 more than any other team.
Woods became famous for his Ickey Shuffle touchdown dance, which
he performed 15 times in the regular season and three times more in the
postseason. Using McNally's zone blocking scheme in combination with
Boomer Esiason running Sam Wyche's no-huddle offense, Woods and
the Bengals won the AFC title and lost to San Francisco in the Super
Bowl 20-16. (Ickey Woods would tear his left ACL in 1989; he never
returned to the form that made him a one-season superstar.)
IN THE 1990s zone blocking became ever more prevalent. Theories
abound on why this happened. Bruce Coslet, who was offensive coor-
dinator on the Wyche-McNally Bengals teams of the late '80s, suggests
the reason was that linemen kept growing larger, becoming less ca-
131

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
pable of executing the man-on-man blocks that characterized so many
earlier running schemes.
"They couldn't trap, they couldn't pull and they couldn't run," says
Coslet. "Before the early '80s everybody was running sweeps and using
angle blocking and trapping. But as linemen got bigger and bigger, you
just couldn't do that stuff. Our linemen with the Bengals, we called them
the Road Graders. They would just knock the shit out of the guy in front
of them with a double team, and then whoever got off that block would
get to the second level and knock the shit out of the linebacker. That's all
zone blocking was for us."
Mudd doesn't disagree. "In a sense, we've lost a lot of the tech-
niques I grew up with," he says. "The taking angles, the trapping. And
there's no question that when you get people 340, 350 pounds, they're
not going to be able to run around the corner and leverage people.
They just can't."
But there is a middle ground where many offenses have taken up
residence. While
it's true that many NFL offensive linemen of the
1990s became almost grotesquely outsized and opened holes more
or less by leaning on defenders, Munoz argues that the most effec-
tive zone blocking is accomplished by big, but not massive, men who
can move. "We had guys in Cincinnati," he says, "who weighed 300 to
310 pounds, and you had to be nimble and agile to run the system. You
had to move, and you had to get to the second level."
The
direct descendant
of
Bill Yeoman, Howard Mudd and Jim
McNally is Alex Gibbs. A former running back and defensive back at Da-
vidson, Gibbs started coaching offensive linemen at the age of 34 when
he took a job at Ohio State under Woody Hayes in 1975. His greatest
impact would come more than two decades and eight jobs later, when
he coached the Denver Broncos' offensive line from 1995 to 2003, under
head coach Mike Shanahan.
Gibbs installed a zone blocking scheme that relied not only on
adroit movement and double teams at the point of impact but also—
controversially—on cut blocks at the second level. In a four-year period
starting in 1995 and culminating in back-to-back Super Bowl victories
to end the '97 and '98 seasons, Terrell Davis ran for 6,413 yards. Eight
different offensive linemen started at least 14 games for the Broncos;
132

ZONE BLOCKING
all of them weighed less than 300 pounds. They were quick and ath-
letic, and if their cut blocking rankled opponents who deemed it dan-
gerous and career-threatening,
it was also well within the rules. No
less an authority than Munoz says, "Cutting has always been a part of
offensive line play. Those guys at Denver in those years did a terrific job
of getting to the second level."
Gibbs, who became the Houston Texans' offensive line coach, remains
at the vortex of NFL offensive line play. As for the question of whether
there is or isn't anything new about zone blocking, Gibbs, like his peers,
surely has opinions; but he's not the one who will resolve that debate—he
doesn't grant interviews.

THE RUN-AND-SHOOT
The concept was borrowedby Mouse Davisfrom Tiger Ellison: Spreadthe
fieldwithyour offensiveformation (thus stretching the defense) andrely on
the quarterback andhis receivers to be inperfect sync Mouse unleashedhis
version in the late '60s. In thisplay the three receivers to the right side run
assignedroutes: a deep "go
von the outside (ifhe cant beat the defender, he
breaks it offwith a 15- to 18-yardcurl to the sideline), a seam route in the
middle anda shallow cross on the inside. The lone receiver on the leftside
simply reads the defense andruns awayfrom the coverage. The quarterback
makes the same read; it is up to him to decide which ofthe three receivers
presents the best target. Three-step drop, quick decision, delivery.
