Chapter 16
THE COVER
TWO
As the long passing game began to run amok in the NFL,
frantic defensive coaches needed help; this was it
league changed course. Jan. 12, 1969: Super Bowl III, Jets over Colts,
establishing sudden
legitimacy
for
the American
Football
League.
Jan. 10, 1982: Dwight Clark and the Catch marks the beginning of the
Bill Walsh dynasty in San Francisco. Those are among the obvious
ones. But Jan. 23, 2000, would appear on very few lists of such dates.
Obscure as it may seem, though, it was a watershed evening in the his-
tory of the league, a day on which defensive ingenuity and execution
stymied the celebrated offensive revolution, in the process expanding
the lexicon of the sport. And the defense did all that without even win-
ning the game.
The St. Louis Rams had seized the NFL by its throat during the 1999
season. Offensive coordinator Mike Martz had stretched the bound-
aries of Don Coryell's daring vertical passing game (Chapter 6) and
rung up a league-high 526 points while winning 13 games, even after
a preseason injury to designated starting quarterback Trent Green.
His replacement, an obscure 28-year-old quarterback named Kurt
Warner, became the league's MVP. The Rams had scored 49 points on
St. Louis, Mo.

the Minnesota Vikings in the divisional playoffs and on this January
day would face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the right to represent
the NFC in Super Bowl XXXIV.
"There was a sense around the league that the Rams were pretty
much unstoppable," recalls Tony Dungy, who was then in his fifth
year as the Bucs' head coach. "And there was a real respect there.
Not just among the fans but among coaches, too. That was a very
good offense."
The Bucs had a defense that was very good too. Dungy knew
it,
and his defensive coordinator, 60 -year- old Monte Kiffin, knew it. The
Bucs had yielded more than 20 points in a game just four times. They
had become dominant, but offense sells. The Rams were expected to
roll, favored by two touchdowns.
They played a time warp game that night in the Trans World
Dome in St. Louis. Warner needed 43 attempts to complete 26 pass-
es for 258 yards (in the regular season he had needed only 31 at-
tempts on average to get more than 270 yards in a game). He was
intercepted by the Bucs three times. Warner had to settle for short
completions, and the Bucs ran to the ball in swarms, gang-tackling
and reducing damage. St. Louis drives stalled for lack of a big play.
Nevertheless, the Rams won when Warner squeezed a late-fourth-
quarter touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl into a tiny seam in the
Tampa Bay coverage. The final score was 11-6. The Rams went to
the Super Bowl.
The Bucs went into a different kind of history. "That day we just
played the same defense we'd been playing all season," says Dungy.
"And we did a pretty darn good job of keeping them out of the end
zone. This is a copycat league. People saw that game and started do-
ing what we were doing."
Six years later the copycat evolution of that Bucs defense looked
like this: Late in the
first quarter of a Sunday-night regular-season
game early in the 2006 NFL season, the Bears led the Seahawks, who
faced third-and-14 on their own 39-yard line. Seattle lined up in a
four-wide offensive set. The Bears' defense countered in a 4-3 set with
two deep safeties. It would defend the play in the conservative "Cover
Two" hybrid scheme now known as Tampa Two, so named because it
172

THE COVER TWO
took hold with Dungy's Buccaneers.
It had become the single-most-
popular defense in the NFL, a bend-but-don't-break system that forces
offenses to execute the length of the field five yards at a time. After a
season-opening shutout loss to Chicago, venerable Packers quarter-
back Brett Favre had said, "I think the Bears are the best that's ever
played that style."
In simplest terms, Tampa Two
is a zone defense with two deep
safeties playing Cover Two (each
is responsible for half the width
of the field), two cornerbacks jamming wide receivers at the line of
scrimmage, two outside linebackers patrolling the short zones and a
middle linebacker roaming from the line of scrimmage to as much
as 30 yards downfield, and four pass rushers. By the 2006 season
the defense was at the peak of its popularity. Jim Schwartz, then the
respected defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans, said at the
time,
"I'll bet you 30 out of 32 teams in the league play
it." Those
teams that most relied on the Tampa Two would employ it on as many
as 40% of their defensive plays.
On the play in that 2006 game, Seattle quarterback Matt Has-
selbeck took a five-step drop and threw toward slot wideout Bobby
Engram in the curl zone 10 yards downfield, slightly to the right of
center. The ball, Engram, Bears nickelback Ricky Manning Jr. and
linebacker Lance Briggs arrived simultaneously. The pass bounced
off Engram's hands as he was taken down by Manning and Briggs.
The Seahawks punted and lost the game, 37-6. It was a classic Tampa
Two stop, with the Bears' defense functioning precisely as designed.
"From now on we're calling it Bear Two," said Chicago's All-Pro line-
backer Brian Urlacher later that week. "Best thing about this defense?
It works, man."
It works, man, because it is the cumulative result of more than three
decades' worth of defensive progression. Follow along.
In the midsummer training-camp heat of that same season, Bears
head coach Lovie Smith stood on a practice field between two-a-day
sessions. He is one of the devotees of the Dungy-Kiffin system—he was
a member of that Tampa Bay staff during its run of defensive domi-
nance, and he took the Tampa Two with him to Chicago from St. Louis,
his intermediate stop. Smith knew as well as anyone that this was one
173

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
of those football innovations that may have seemed to arrive suddenly
but has roots deep in the game.
"I played Cover Two when I was in high school back in Texas in the
1970s," Smith says. "And they were playing Cover Two long before
I
got there."
Early Cover Two was straightforward. Two safeties split the field, far
from the line of scrimmage. It was the simplest way to defend the deep
zone in case the cornerbacks got beat, or in case the offense used more
than two receivers, which, until the 1970s, they seldom did at any level of
the game. Cover Two was uncomplicated and safe.
But as with any zone defense, there were holes: between the safeties
and outside the safeties. Generally, Cover Two allowed wide receivers to
roam relatively freely in the secondary. Defensive coaches began concoct-
ing ways to fill those holes. One was to roll the cornerbacks up close to the
wide receivers, disrupting them at the line to throw off the timing of pass
routes and allow the safeties more time to react. First to try it?
"Late 1960s, I was a quarterback with the 49ers, and we're playing
the Cleveland Browns," says longtime college head coach (and briefly
the Redskins' coach) Steve Spurrier. "John Brodie was the starter, and
he used to love to throw the quick out. Five yards, zip it right in there. If
the cornerback rolled up on one side, John would throw it the other way.
So in this game, John sees one corner rolled up, looks the other way,
and that corner is rolled up too. He comes over to the sideline and says,
'They can't do that!' I said, Well, they just did.' "
Former Michigan State head coach George Perles does Spurrier one
better: "In 1967, 1 was at Michigan State working under Duffy Daugh-
erty. We played Houston in the first game of the season. Bill Yeoman
was the coach there. They played Cover Two and rolled up the corners.
Beat us 37-7."
The great leap forward was initiated in the early 1970s by Bud Carson,
a slight man among the giants of the NFL. Like so many coaches who
impacted the game, Carson was born in steel country near Pittsburgh.
He played high school football and then at North Carolina. In '67, at the
age of 37, Carson succeeded the legendary Bobby Dodd as head coach at
Georgia Tech but lasted just five years, losing as many games as he won
(27-27). For the '72 season he was hired by Chuck Noll to be the Steelers'
174

THE COVER TWO
defensive coordinator. Carson could not have known that he stood on the
cusp of something big.
Noll was in his fourth year coaching the hapless Steelers, a franchise
known for being scrappy, but usually in defeat. They had improved
from 1-13 in 1969 to 6-8 in '71, slowly clawing at respectability. As
they climbed, the pieces of a legendary defense were coming together:
Defensive tackle "Mean" Joe Greene was selected No. 4 overall in '69,
cornerback Mel Blount in the third round in '70, linebacker Jack Ham
and defensive end Dwight White in
'71. On this foundation Carson
installed a basic Cover Two scheme, and then he tweaked it.
Capitalizing on the power of the 6' 3", 205-pound Blount (he was
really as much a linebacker as he was a defensive back), Carson
pushed the corners up to the line of scrimmage and instructed them
to jam wide receivers. The safeties—Mike Wagner and Glen Edwards
(or, when Edwards was hurt, Ralph Anderson)—were assigned to
cover deep zones behind the jamming corners. Outside linebackers
Ham and Andy Russell would cover vast space from hash mark to
sideline, and middle linebacker Henry Davis, a journeyman keeping
the seat warm for the Hall of Famer to come, would be required to
drop deep in the middle zone, sometimes 25, even 35 yards deep.
Using linebackers in deep coverage was a radical scheme, but
its
liberation of the rest of the defense would serve as a viable counter-
attack to the short-throw, possession-passing systems that were be-
ginning to proliferate, particularly Bill Walsh's so-called West Coast
offense (Chapter 8).
"Bud came in one day, I think it was early in the season," as Wagner
recalls, "and just drew it on a chalkboard. It was different, but I think
everybody in the room could see the potential right away. We went out
to practice that same day and started running it. And we loved it."
Ham, then just a year out of Penn State, says, "We actually played a lot
of Cover Two in college, but this was different. And obviously Bud could
see that we had the right people to play it."
Russell loved the concept and loved playing for the coach who gave it
to them, telling SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, "He's like a mad scientist, looking
for a formula and changing it every day."
The Steelers went 21-7 over the next two seasons, losing twice in the
175

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
playoffs. But they continued to add the right people to play Carson's cov-
er two. Cornerback J.T. Thomas was taken out of Florida State with the
first pick of the '73 draft; he was 6' 2", 196 pounds, only slightly smaller
than Blount and just as inclined to play a physical game. A year later
the Steelers used their second-round pick to take a skinny 6' 4" middle
linebacker out of Kent State named Jack Lambert. He was freakishly
skilled and also ferocious, and he proved to be the perfect Cover Two
linebacker: He had the speed to make the deep drops and the instincts
to know when to get there.
Carson's
core philosophy was
to
force an
offense
to
settle
for
short
gains
on
underneath
dump-off
passes,
requiring
the
of-
fense
to show
sustained
execution,
clock consumption
and,
per-
haps most
significant, patience. "There
are not a
lot of big plays
out there against this defense," says former NFL quarterback Rich
Gannon, who played from 1987 through 2004, in the heart of the
Tampa Two
resurgence. "You have
to be
patient and
take
four-,
five-, six-yard plays and work your way up the
field. That's some-
thing
coordinators
and
quarterbacks
don't
always
enjoy
doing."
Think of these as the Five Commandments of Tampa Two:
1) The front four must be able to rush the quarterback, allowing the
linebackers freedom. "If you get four men who can rush the passer,
you can play cover two, Tampa Two all day," says Ham. "But you can't
play it without a pass rush, because it's a zone defense, and there are
lots of holes
if the quarterback can sit back and wait." The Steelers
made their pass rush effective with Joe Greene and L.C. Greenwood,
the Buccaneers with Warren Sapp and Simeon Rice and the 2006
Bears— all the way to the Super Bowl—with Tommie Harris and Alex
Brown as part of an eight-deep posse of solid defensive linemen mov-
ing in and out of the game.
2) The middle linebacker must be able, and willing, to frequently drop
as deep as 30 yards, filling the deep crossing zone between the safe-
ties, and leaving many of the glamour plays—helmet-popping tackles,
interceptions—to the outside linebackers and the safeties. "My pri-
mary purpose in that defense is to run back to the huddle and con-
gratulate somebody for making a play while I was running down the
field with the tight end," says Brian Urlacher, who went on to become
176

THE COVER TWO
an All-Pro playing Tampa Two middle linebacker in the mid-2000s.
Urlacher refined the position played by Lambert. At 6' 4", 258 pounds
with running back speed, Urlacher could sit on the line longer than most
Tampa Two middle linebackers, allowing him to read running plays be-
fore bailing out, yet
still able to drop into 25-yard pass plays and dis-
rupt them. "He's a freak," said Bears quarterback Rex Grossman in 2006.
"Trust me. I play against him every day, and I test him. You can't throw
over him in the middle."
3) The outside linebackers have
to be smart enough and
athletic
enough to not only cover receivers in the middle zone but also to
rally to runs at the line of scrimmage. "You're not looking for your
old-fashioned linebacker who makes tackles in a phone booth," says
Dungy. "You're looking for an open-field tackier and athlete." Think
nickelback Ronde Barber with vintage Tampa Bay teams or linebacker
Lance Briggs with the mid-2000s Bears. The outside 'backers also
have to jam tight ends and slot receivers to keep them from releas-
ing into the middle zone vacated by the dropping middle linebacker.
In 2006 the woeful Detroit Lions hired Rod Marinelli from Tampa
Bay as their head coach, and Marinelli then drafted lightning-quick
230-pound middle linebacker Ernie Sims from Florida State to play
the Lambert-Urlacher role with the Lions.
4) The cornerbacks must be physical enough to jam wideouts at the
line of scrimmage and also to tackle ballcarriers. In Tampa Two they
are not expected to run down the field with receivers but merely dis-
rupt them and pass them along to the safeties. "I think one of the big
reasons Tampa Two developed was to take pressure off the corners in
terms of coverage," says former NFL quarterback and Monday Night
Football analyst Ron Jaworski. Yet the initial disruption is vital. "Our
job is to get our hands on the receiver and knock him off his route,"
says Charles Tillman, who played on the Bears Super Bowl team in
2006. "That little bit of a bump can change the whole play." Blount
was the prototype in 1972 and, all these years later, it is hard to imag-
ine a more ideal Tampa Two corner.
5) The safeties must be smart enough to break properly on balls
in the air and physical enough to create, and survive, the violent
collisions with wide receivers that happen when the safety has run
177

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
25 yards from his deep starting position. "This defense is the rea-
son you see so many penalties on safeties," says Ham. "They're out
there to create collisions."
CARSON'S 1974 Steelers played the first true, modern Cover Two defense.
It would be known far and wide as the Steel Curtain. While the Steeler
offense during the '70s dynasty was no slouch (Bradshaw, Harris, Swann,
Stallworth, Webster), it was the defense that was the heart of a franchise
that won four Super Bowls in six years. In 1976 (a non-Super Bowl year),
the Steelers gave up 28 points over the last nine regular-season games
and pitched five shutouts.
The
front four
of Greene, White,
L.C. Greenwood and Ernie
Holmes was almost unblockable even without blitz help from line-
backers. Ham, Lambert and Russell were as good as any trio of
linebackers that has ever played together. Thomas and Blount were
perfect Cover Two corners, Wagner a cerebral yet reckless
safety.
"The amazing thing," says Woody Widenhofer, a defensive assistant
with the Steel Curtain Steelers (as was Perles),
"is that Bud had
played a lot of two-man zone, but he looked at our personnel and
just adapted everything to it."
After the 1977 season Carson left Pittsburgh to join the Los Angeles
Rams. He would work as the defensive coordinator for the Rams for four
seasons, helping get them to the '79 Super Bowl. In '89 he was finally
given his own team, the Cleveland Browns, but lasted just a season and a
half as head coach before being fired in the middle of a 3-13 year.
Yet Carson not only earned an important place in coaching history
but was also a vital link in a coaching chain. Before the 1977 season, the
Steelers had signed University of Minnesota quarterback Tony Dungy as
a free agent and then converted him first into a wide receiver and then a
safety. He played two years for the Steelers, including the season of their
'78 Super Bowl championship. He also paid close attention. Dungy would
become one of the most successful coordinators, then head coaches, in
league history. At every turn Carson was in his head. "Everything we do
now," Dungy said in the fall of 2006, with his Colts en route to winning
the Super Bowl, "you can find in my Pittsburgh Steelers playbook. I did
keep it all those years."
178

THE COVER TWO
Dungy left the Steelers after two seasons, but by 1981, at the age
of 25, he was back in Pittsburgh as an assistant coach. He was the
Steelers' coordinator from '84 through '88 and assumed the same po-
sition with the Vikings in '92, where he met up with Monte Kiffin,
then a 52-year-old Nebraska native and coaching journeyman with a
jones for defense and some of the same ideas that Dungy was carry-
ing around in his old Steelers playbook. Offenses were getting better,
faster, more sophisticated; defenses needed an answer.
Like
the
best
coaches,
Kiffin
enjoyed
finding
answers. He
was
raised on Cornhuskers
football
in
Lexington,
Neb.,
in
the
south-central part of the state between Kearney and North Platte.
He took his game to Lincoln in 1959 as a two-way tackle and re-
turned in '66 as a defensive assistant coach under Bob Devaney. The
Huskers won national championships in '70 and '71, and a tradition
of defensive excellence— starters wore black shirts in practice and
became known as the Blackshirts even before Kiffin arrived—was
established.
Kiffin worked at Nebraska for 11 years, under both Devaney and
his successor, Tom Osborne. Then he did a typical coach's tour:
six
stops in 15 years, including a 16-17 record in three years (1980-82) at
North Carolina State, his only head coaching job, before landing back
in Minnesota. Dungy's arrival led to a marriage of like minds. Together
he and Kiffin modified Carson's old system, putting Jack Del Rio in the
crucial middle linebacker spot and rolling up the corners aggressively.
The Vikings made the playoffs for three straight years and in '94 led
the NFL in total defense.
When Dungy was hired as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
in 1996, he brought Kiffin aboard to run his defense. Together they re-
fined the Cover Two into a defensive force. "Tony and I had both used
a lot of the theories that became what everybody calls Tampa Two,"
says Kiffin. "He had learned some things with the Steelers, and I had
been playing some of it when I was coaching in college. We sort of put
them together." Their defensive mission was to close the traditional
holes in the Cover Two. All defenses have holes on paper, and theirs
was no exception.
They worked primarily at two things: One was finding the perfect
179

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
personnel, like tackle Sapp and outside linebacker Derrick Brooks,
whose ability to cover flat zones and rally to ballcarriers was crucial to
the Tampa Two—and almost unmatched in the NFL during Brooks's
prime. Second was improving the Cover Two against the run on a
consistent basis.
"And that's exactly what Monte did," says former USC coach Pete
Carroll, a lifelong friend of Kiffin's. "He made
it awesome against the
run. What Monte and Tony did in Tampa was almost revolutionize de-
fense. They took a good, simple system and made it very, very precise."
For years, Cover Two was played with an "under" front four. Under
signifies a shift to the weak (non-tight end) side of the offensive for-
mation. At Tampa Bay, Kiffin completed a transition to an "over" front
alignment, meaning that the defensive front four is shifted to the strong
(tight end) side of the offensive formation. "In the over defense you play
your linebackers more off the line of scrimmage," says Kiffin. "That puts
more emphasis on your seam droppers [outside linebackers and nick-
elbacks] to get into the flat zones. We had Derrick Brooks and Ronde
Barber playing those positions."
If the Tampa Two reached
its peak with Tampa Bay's Super Bowl
victory following the 2002 season, it remained a force with the Bears'
Super Bowl appearance in '06. Predictably, receivers evolved, becoming
better skilled at beating the essential jams at the line of scrimmage; at
the same time, officials became more diligent in calling penalties on
hand-chucks at the line.
Offenses began to find new holes to exploit. "There's a sweet spot
against the Tampa Two," Jaworski said in 2006. "Eighteen or 19 yards
on the sideline. But any less than 18, 19 yards, and the receiver is
still
jammed; and any more, and the receiver is in the hospital because the
safety came over to hit him. And it takes a great throw."
Quarterbacks became more adept at making that great throw. Re-
ceivers got better at making the catch and getting to the ground before
the concussive hit was delivered. "The biggest thing," says Kiffin, "was
that it got harder to catch teams off balance with the scheme. They had
a chance to study it."
In the spring of 2009 Kiffin suddenly left the NFL to return to the
college ranks as defensive coach at Tennessee, where his son, Lane,
180

THE COVER TWO
had become head coach. A year later Lane moved on, together with
his father, to L.A. to become head coach at USC—taking the place
of Pete Carroll, who has suddenly returned to the NFL to coach the
Seahawks. In the coaching world, these were seismic changes. But
one thing remained the same: both Kiffin and Carroll would still be
coaching the Tampa Two.
181

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
THE 46 DEFENSE
Out ofdesperation over the mediocre defensivepersonnel ofthe early- 80s
Chicago Bears, Buddy Ryan concocted the 46 defense (so-named by Ryan
spontaneouslyfor strong safety Doug Plank, whosejersey number was 46)
.
It is effective largely because it "covers"head-on the three interior offensive
linemen with defenders, dramatically reducing theprotectionpackages
available to the offense because the center and both guards had to block one-
on-one and could not move or help in another manner Ryan also overloaded
one side ofthe defense close behind the line,further confusing the offense
as to which defenders might blitz. It is a high-risk defense, with as many as
eight defenders in the box andjust a single highfree safety.
