college game with its innovative attack. The wishbone worked. And it was
copied. Emory Bellard recalls that by the spring of 1970, a steady stream
of coaching staffs passed through Austin to watch the Horns practice and
then sit for a tutoring session on this fabulous new offense. "Around our
offices during spring training, you couldn't swing a stick without hitting
half a dozen coaches," says Bellard. "It was just unreal."
He found himself doing clinics on almost every off day, all over the South-
west. He wrote manuals to help coaching staffs teach the wishbone. If some
of those beseeching Bellard for his wisdom were seeking to emulate Texas's
domination—and, of course, some were—many were simply attracted to
the utilitarian qualities of the wishbone. It wasn't a power-based attack that
required offensive linemen to open holes with power drive blocks. Rather,
it used finesse blocking schemes in which linemen simply walled off their
defensive counterparts or slanted inside and blocked half their bodies. The
fact that two defenders were left unblocked and read by the quarterback
made it more attractive. Defenses were forced to play conservatively, care-
fully, making sure that all options were adequately defended. It was perilous

to blitz, because wishbone plays often broke the first level of containment.
"All of a sudden," says Bellard, "every play can be a touchdown."
Darrell Royal would never forget these facets of the wishbone. In the sum-
mer of 1998, in the members' grill at the Barton Creek Country Club, where
Royal played golf in retirement, he was asked by a visitor to recall the spring
of '68, when the Texas wishbone altered the landscape of college football. It
was furnace-hot outside, and though the grill was air-conditioned to meat-
locker temperature, Royal was still flushed from his round in the sunshine.
He immediately began reaching over the black marble tabletop for con-
diment containers, arranging them with his gnarled, arthritic 74-year-old
hands. A salt shaker was the quarterback, ajar of mustard the fullback, bot-
tles of Tabasco sauce and ketchup a set of halfbacks. Royal rode his mustard
with the salt and then slid the glass vessel toward the edge of the table while
dragging his Tabasco halfback nearby, pushing it faster. Royal imagined de-
fenders trying to find the ball, trying to keep their responsibilities straight,
trying to play at full speed. "This will take care of those fancy pass rushers
straight away," he says, joyfully smacking the table with his open right hand.
Back in 1968, when the mustard was Steve Worster and the ketchup
was Chris Gilbert, a few onlookers were taking note of what Royal was
up to. One was Jim Brakefield, coach at Wofford College in Spartanburg,
S.C. When Brakefield had been an assistant at Wofford in the late '50s, the
team had included an undersized wingback named Fisher DeBerry. When
Brakefield became head coach, he made DeBerry, who'd been coaching
high school ball in South Carolina, an assistant. They installed the split-
back T formation, and Wofford endured four-win seasons in '67 and '68.
"People weren't real ecstatic about Jim's record those first two seasons,"
says DeBerry. "Well, Jim saw Texas play Tennessee in the Cotton Bowl after
the '68 season, and he liked what Texas was doing. We were already using
some real wide splits [between players] on the offensive line and running
some splitback Houston veer, and Jim thought maybe he could mesh that
with the Texas wishbone. Coach Royal sent up some film, and we studied
and decided to put it in."
The result was much as
it had been in Austin. Wofford lost the first
two games of the 1969 season and then won 20 straight. When Brakefield
moved to Appalachian State, he took DeBerry with him. They stayed nine
seasons before Ken Hatfield hired DeBerry to bring the wishbone to the
60

OPTION FEVER
Air Force Academy in 1980. Four seasons later DeBerry took over as head
coach, and for 23 years DeBerry's Air Force teams used the wishbone to
overcome a weekly deficit in size and speed. The Falcons won 169 games
and went to 12 postseason bowls, along with mixing in the occasional epic
upset, like the Beau Morgan-engineered victory over Notre Dame in 1996.
"Let's be frank," says DeBerry. "We had a system, and that system was
the wishbone. And that gave us a chance to win. We couldn't recruit the
same athletes as Colorado and Nebraska and Notre Dame. The wishbone
is an offense that's based on routine and repetition; and routine and rep-
etition are built into an Air Force Academy cadet's every day.
I think the
offense and academy go hand-in-glove." (The same was later true for Navy
and Army, each of which prospered with the wishbone and its hybrids.)
DeBerry did not stand pat. He was among the first coaches to widen—or
"break"—the wishbone by taking the halfbacks and lining them up as wing-
backs, outside and just behind the offensive tackle (or tight end). It was
called the flexbone, and it forced defenses to cover more options laterally—
clearly among the precursors to the spread offenses (Chapters 12-15) that
proliferated in the first decade of the new millennium. When Urban Meyer
was coaching at Utah, he sought out DeBerry for advice on the option of-
fense and later used a spread option to win two national titles at Florida
and turn quarterback Tim Tebow into a Heisman Trophy winner.
Wishbone growth was not limited to the small and outmanned. Among
the first coaches to approach Royal and Bellard was Paul (Bear) Bryant of
Alabama. Bryant had been ensconced in Tuscaloosa since 1958, and in the
eight years from '60 to '67, the Bear's teams lost only eight games and won
two national championships. But in '68, '69 and '70 Alabama lost a total
of 13 games, with back-to-back five-loss seasons. It appeared there was no
magic left in Bryant's houndstooth hat, and surely none in the pro-style pass-
ing game that was operated by his quarterback Scott Hunter. Bryant called
Royal and asked for help. Royal and Bellard went to Tuscaloosa and holed up
with Bryant and his staff in a hotel room, teaching the wishbone. The tutor-
ing session lasted for four days. In the ensuing '71 season, Alabama went 11-1.
From '71 to '79 the Tide rolled up a 97-11 record and won two national titles.
But there was another wishbone conversion that had far more impact
on college football. The Oklahoma Sooners were in transition through the
mid-1960s. Bud Wilkinson had retired his whistle after the '63 season.
61

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Gomer Jones went 9-11-1 in two seasons, was replaced by Jim Mackenzie,
whose team went 6-4 in '66 but was rocked when Mackenzie died sud-
denly of a heart attack after a spring practice in April '67 Mackenzie was
replaced by assistant Chuck Fairbanks—but the far greater influence would
come from a little-known offensive assistant named Barry Switzer.
Fairbanks's Sooners went 10-1 in 1967 but lost to one of Royal's four-loss
Texas teams; for the next three years Oklahoma fell to the Longhorn wish-
bone, including a 41-9 pasting in '70. OU had been using the two-back Hous-
ton veer, but Switzer had grown antsy watching Texas run its wishbone.
"We were struggling with the veer," says Switzer. "So now it's 1970, and
Texas is running up and down the field on everybody with the wishbone. So
I'm talking with Larry Lacewell, who's running our defense, and I'm say-
ing, 'Lacewell, this wishbone is what we should be doing. We've got a better
quarterback than James Street [Jack Mildren]. We've got Gregg Pruitt and
Joe Wylie. We've got better players than them." The racial element played
heavily in Switzer's thinking. The 1969 Texas Longhorns were the last all-
white national championship team; Switzer at the same time was recruit-
ing black players, which he viewed as a distinct advantage. "Darrell wasn't
even recruiting black athletes," says Switzer. "We were getting the best black
athletes out of Texas." In fact, they were getting many of the best white ath-
letes out of Texas too. Mildren was from Abilene and was white. Pruitt, who
would become a two-time All-America as one of the most dynamic wish-
bone halfbacks ever, was from Houston and was black.
After losing to Oregon State in the third game of the 1970 season, Okla-
homa had a week off. Switzer and Lacewell persuaded Fairbanks to work
in some wishbone plays for the upcoming Texas game. That was the 41-9
loss. "Texas kicked our asses pretty good," says Switzer, who became the
head coach in 1973. "But you could see we were getting better at it. And the
next year we kicked their asses."
Indeed, in 1971 Oklahoma ran the Longhorns into the ground, 48-27 In
one year they had become the most potent wishbone team in history. The
'71 Oklahoma Sooners would average 472.4 rushing yards per game, a re-
cord still comfortably standing in 2010. "We were having a track meet every
weekend, hanging half a hundred on everybody," says Switzer, invoking two
of his favorite wishbone phrases—track meet and half a hundred. Switzer's
teams seemed to play at a speed that was visibly faster than their opponents',
62

OPTION FEVER
as a succession of wishbone quarterbacks and halfbacks laid waste to the
Big Eight and the nation. In his first 30 games as head coach, Switzer went
unbeaten; the Sooners wishbone would lose just 33 games over 18 years and
win three national championships, including in '74 and '75.
In a bizarre twist Oklahoma was hit with NCAA sanctions for recruit-
ing violations prior to '73 that were invoked during the '74 and '75 season;
the Sooners were banned from appearing on television in both seasons and
from playing in a bowl following the '74 season. All of this notoriety lent an
even more mythic air to the ripping Sooners wishbone, as if it were a slice
of cowboy folklore, and Switzer was the perfect black hat. In '74 he told SI,
"They can keep us offTV and ban us from the bowls, but nobody said that we
couldn't win and have some fun."
Looking back, Switzer says, "I had a great run, but
I'll tell you some-
thing: We had great players. For quarterbacks
I had Jack Mildren, Steve
Davis, Thomas Lott, J.C. Watts, Jamelle Holieway. For running backs I had
Kenny King,Joe Washington, Billy Sims, Horace Ivory, Elvis Peacock. Great,
great players. And with the wishbone, they couldn't stop us."
What is most remarkable is that Texas gave the wishbone to the archrival
Sooners. After being routed by Texas in that 1970 game, Fairbanks called Royal
and asked for help. The Sooners had picked up the big strokes of the wishbone
from film but needed work with the subtleties. Royal was an Oklahoma alum-
nus, with some lingering loyalty to the Crimson and Cream. He called Bellard.
"Emory," he said, "Chuck Fairbanks is gonna lose his job up there if they
don't do something about their offense, so I want to help him out. Barry
Switzer is gonna be calling, and I want you to tell him whatever they need
to know to put in the wishbone."
Bellard was stunned. As much as he had been willing to help other
teams, the thought of handing over his prized weapon to the rival Sooners
was too much to swallow. "Darrell, you gotta be joking," said Bellard.
"Nope," said Royal. "I'm just as dead serious as I can be."
Royal was the boss. Bellard backed down. Switzer called a week later
and kept on calling for several months. "Anytime he had a question about
what to do in a certain situation or against some defense, he would just call
me right up," says Bellard. "We gave the whole thing to 'em."
Nearly four decades later Switzer insists the Sooners would have figured it
out anyway. "Aw, sure, they helped us a little bit," he says. "But Emory had done
63

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
a bunch of lectures, and we had all the Texas film, so it's not like there were a lot
of secrets. By the time the 1971 season came around, our offense had it rolling,
and we just about changed college football for the next 20 years or so."
After turning the wishbone over to his alma mater, Darrell Royal never
beat the Sooners again as a head coach, losing every year from 1971 to '75
before salvaging a 6-6 tie in '76, his last year as coach of the Longhorns.
More than 20 years later, in the summer of 2007, Bellard and Royal got
together for an afternoon, two old coaches trading stories. In the middle of
it all, Royal turned to his old assistant and said, "Emory, if I had it to do all
over again, I probably wouldn't have been so benevolent."
Among the many coaches casting his eyes to the Southwest was Lou
Holtz, who was hired as a 32-year-old in 1969 as head coach at William &
Mary. He had been an assistant with Woody Hayes's powerhouse program
at Ohio State and rolled into Williamsburg, Va., intent on running a little of
everything on offense. His first team went 3-7, and in spring meetings he
began studying an option offense that coach Jimmy (Red) Parker had once
used at Arkansas A&M and The Citadel. It fascinated Holtz and, even better,
it looked to him like a lifeline.
"Going into our second year at William and Mary, I sat down with my
staff and said, 'O.K., let's list our assets,' " says Holtz. "We had a fine center.
We didn't have a running back who'd gained a yard in a varsity game. We had
one receiver who had caught three passes. On the offensive line we had prob-
lems everywhere but center. I said, 'How are we going to move the ball?'
Replied his assistant, Larry Beightol, "If I were you, I'd just worry about
making sure it doesn't go backward."
Holtz installed the wishbone and won the Southern Conference title in 1970
and went to the Tangerine Bowl. Two years later he began a four-year run as
head coach at North Carolina State and took the Wolfpack to four consecutive
bowls. Holtz coached 26 more years at four schools and always kept the op-
tion at the core of his offense, always forcing opponents to prepare to defend it,
even if some Saturdays he chose not to run even a single option play.
When Holtz took his dream job at Notre Dame in 1986, he commit-
ted wholly to the option game. The problem was that, initially, he didn't
have an option quarterback, having inherited senior Steve Beuerlein from
previous coach Gerry Faust's failed regime. Beuerlein would play 14 years
and start 102 games in the NFL, but at a statuesque 6' 3", 220 pounds, he
64

OPTION FEVER
was glacially slow. Holtz tried to run the option just the same, instructing
Beuerlein never to keep the ball. In a summer practice he kept the ball on
an option play and ran 20 yards upheld and was stunned to see Holtz chas-
ing him from behind. "Steve Beuerlein, don't you ever run the ball again!"
screamed Holtz. "You see that fast guy behind you? He's the runner. Pitch
the ball to him and get out of the way."
A year later Beuerlein had been replaced by Tony Rice, a quarterback
Barry Switzer would have loved: quick, strong, decisive and, just to further
torment defenses, with a strong arm to exploit the deep defensive third of
the field. Rice led Notre Dame to the national championship in 1988 and
to the No. 2 national ranking a year later when the Irish knocked off previ-
ously unbeaten Colorado 21-6 in the Orange Bowl.
That win was significant because one year later Colorado would share
the national championship running an I formation hybrid of the wishbone
installed by offensive coordinator Gerry DiNardo under head coach Bill
McCartney. That championship came nine years after McCartney was hired
and five years after switching to the wishbone's cousin, the I-bone. "And I
certainly think it was done out of desperation," says DiNardo.
Colorado had gone 7-25-1 in McCartney's first three seasons. "Bill wanted
to throw the ball, so we threw the ball," says DiNardo. "I remember the head-
line in the Boulder Daily Camera said something like BUFFS WILL BE THE
BYU OF THE BIG EIGHT. Even as we started to recruit better players, we still
couldn't win. To me, from an analytical perspective, we were throwing too
much on first-and-10. That's such an important down. It's the only neutral
down in football. It's the only down where the defense has to defend every-
thing. But we were throwing so much on first-and-10 that even against equal
talent like Kansas and Kansas State—we were bad, they were bad—we were
constantly in second-and-10. And second-and-10 favors the defense.
"So we started looking around at what other people were doing of-
fensively," says DiNardo. "And we are absolutely desperate. At that point,
we're talking 1984, you've got Lou Holtz running a form of the wishbone at
Minnesota. You've got Oklahoma with Switzer and Larry Lacewell. You've
got Jim Wacker at TCU, Ken Hatfield at Arkansas and, of course, you've
got Fisher DeBerry at Air Force. So after all those years of second-and-10,
we've got to find a way to get four yards on first down. Well, we felt like
if we read the triple option correctly, it was pretty much unstoppable for
65

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
four yards on first down. So we put it in for 1985 and sold our kids on the
theory that if we could play first-and-10, second-and-six, third-and-two
and stay on schedule 50 percent of the time, we would win every game.
And it darn near worked out that way."
Not at first. DiNardo met with DeBerry, Hatfield and Lacewell in the
winter of 1985 and installed the option at spring practice. He took the
practice tape to Lacewell to view during a national coaches' convention.
When DiNardo walked out of the room with his tape, Lacewell said to his
fellow coaches, "I feel bad. They'll be lucky to win a game." The transi-
tion was comically painful. DiNardo recalls a preseason gathering in Den-
ver with a booster club. One of the gentlemen in the audience stood up
and, having heard of the conversion to the wishbone, said to McCartney,
"Please tell me the first play of the season isn't going to be a dive up the
middle, because I don't think I can stand that."
McCartney let the question hang and then answered: "You might want
to come for the second play."
With athletes recruited to play a passing game, the Buffaloes improved
from 1-10 in '84 to 7-5 in '85 to 8-4 in '88, settting the stage for a two-year
run at the national title. "The switch to the wishbone allowed us all to keep
our jobs long enough to start recruiting players," says DiNardo. They did
exactly that, picking up the quicksilver quarterback Darian Hagan, a clas-
sic, tough and slippery wishbone QB, and running backs Eric Bieniemy and
J.J. Flannigan. In their prime the Buffaloes ran their option from an I-bone,
with two backs directly behind the quarterback and the second (lead block-
ing) halfback offset to the side, which DiNardo felt give him a better angle to
throw a load block on the corner.
Colorado won 11 straight before losing to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl
following the '89 season and beat the Irish a year later, 10-9, to earn a piece
of the title with Georgia Tech. "Not only did we stop a very bad slide, but we
won a national championship," says DiNardo. "Which is pretty good."
Nebraska's option offense won three national titles, in 1994, '95 and '97
(shared with Michigan). That number could easily have been five had it not
been for one failed two-point conversion in the '84 Orange Bowl and an
upset loss in the '96 Big 12 championship game. For all of the success that
Texas and Oklahoma achieved in the '70s and '80s, Nebraska's I formation-
based option attack was arguably the most innovative and surely one of the
66

OPTION FEVER
most effective in the game's history. Unlike many of his peers, Nebraska
coach Tom Osborne did not turn to the option out of desperation—in his
case it was out of frustration.
In a 25-year head coaching career that began in 1973 when he was se-
lected to replace his mentor, Bob Devaney, Osborne won nearly 84% of his
games and never won fewer than nine in a season. "But we had trouble
with Oklahoma," he says. "And I really came to admire what they did with
option football." In Osborne's first eight years at Nebraska his teams lost a
total of 20 games; however, they beat Oklahoma only once.
In 1981 Osborne installed an I-based option. "I didn't want to leave the
I and go to the wishbone entirely," says Osborne. "We still liked the idea of
having a great runner back there who could run the ball at any point on the
field. Oklahoma had Billy Sims ['75, '77-79] in a wishbone, and he was a
great player, but he was a little limited in how much he could carry the ball
because of where he lined up."
The Nebraska I option (or I-bone) was an immediate success, largely be-
cause of three-year starting quarterback Turner Gill, who had been the object
of a furious recruiting war while a quarterback at Arlington Heights High
in Fort Worth. "The biggest mistake I ever made in coaching was taking for
granted that Turner Gill was coming to Oklahoma," says Switzer. "February
1980, I'm fighting my ass off for a linebacker. I get a call from Turner Gill. He
puts a stake in my heart and tells me he's going to Nebraska. So not only do I
lose him, but I lose him to Nebraska, and I gotta play their ass!"
With Gill operating the Nebraska attack, the Cornhuskers went 12-1 in
both 1982 and '83 and narrowly lost the '83 national title when Osborne fa-
mously played for a winning two-point conversion and lost to Miami 31-30
in the Orange Bowl. Not long after, the balance of power in the Big Eight
would shift back to Oklahoma and, briefly, to McCartney and Colorado, al-
ways with the wishbone or some form of the triple option as the basis of
the offense. But through the middle of the '90s, Osborne sped the evolution
of Emory Bellard's old game, stringing together a series of innovations and
nearly landing four consecutive national titles. Among Osborne's variations:
• Pulling tackles and guards from the back side of the play to trap aggressive
defenders—such as gap-blitzing linebackers, who had become a popular
defensive answer to the triple option—and creating new seams in the de-
fense. (Even the NFL was watching; Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs
67

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
[Chapter 7] would later credit Osborne with birthing the blocking schemes
that led to the development of the Counter Trey running play that the Skins
rode to Super Bowl victories at the end of the 1987 and '91 NFL seasons.)
• Creating plays in which the quarterback follows a lead blocker, instead
of optioning off of unblocked defenders. Tommie Frazier (1992-95), Scott
Frost ('96 and '97) and 2001 Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch (1998-
2001) all flourished in the system.
• Running option plays with the quarterback in a shotgun formation. Os-
borne, who like so many of his peers is loath to claim invention of anything,
says, "That one, running the option out of the shotgun, I think we were at
least one of the first teams to try that. We got a lot of ideas from the service
academies and from Oklahoma. With them, we had them on the ropes in a
number of games over the years, and their quarterbacks would make a great
play to get them back in contention. We wanted to develop some things where
our quarterbacks could make plays like that."
Switzer says, "Here's what Tom did: He has the quarterback read the
tackle, like always. Now, the linebacker is watching that read, but he doesn't
know the tailback is hauling ass right behind the fullback and he's going to
block the linebacker. Right when that happens, the quarterback ducks into
that seam, and the first guy with a shot at him is the three-deep safety. Tom
got teams in fourth-and-three, and he'd go for
it, and by then I'm out of
college coaching and I'm watching on TV, and I would just start laughing
my ass off because they don't know what's about to hit 'em. Next thing you
know, the Nebraska quarterback is running 50 yards untouched."
By the turn ofthe century, though, the wishbone (and all forms ofthe triple
option) had all but vanished from the college game. Recruiting was clearly a
factor, as the option became stigmatized as failing to prepare star players for
the pro game. "The wishbone in particular became a service-academy of-
fense because the major programs running it could no longer successfully re-
cruit the great quarterback, the great running back, the great left tackle," says
DiNardo. "When we were running it at Colorado, I can't tell you how many
programs beat us up in recruiting by telling kids, 'You won't be able to play
in the NFL because you won't be learning the passing game.' And eventually
most of the option teams just caved in, and it gradually went away."
In related fashion, and just as significantly, there was a rush to install
spread offenses and numerous other throwing systems. Eventually they, too,
68

OPTION FEVER
would incorporate option principles. But as for the pure wishbone, its prac-
titioners dwindled to a precious few. One of them was Paul Johnson, a North
Carolinian who was at his third assistant coaching stop at age 27 when he
was named offensive coordinator at NCAA Division I-AA Georgia Southern
in the spring of 1985. He had played on a wishbone team in high school and
had watched on Saturday afternoons as Oklahoma tore up the midlands and
Alabama the South with the wishbone. "Here was the biggest thing for me,"
says Johnson. "When I was on defense, I thought the option was really hard
to defend well, if it was run right. So I wanted to run it." In his two years at
Georgia Southern, his offense averaged 36 points a game and won 26 of 30.
Ten years laterJohnson was back at Georgia Southern with his first head
coaching position, and he wishboned—flexboned, really—the Southern
Conference and all of Division I-AA into submission. In five years the Eagles
went 62-10, won two national titles and five conference championships.
True to early wishbone strategy, defending it left Georgia Southern's op-
ponents susceptible to the passing game. "Some of those teams, we scored
50 points a game for stretches, and our guys were playing half the game,"
says Johnson. "We could have scored 70 every game if we wanted to."
It galled Johnson then, and it galls him now, that the wishbone fell into
such disfavor and was so roundly criticized, like fashion worn a year too
long. To his mind, it never stopped working. Coaches just stopped using it
because something else was available. "All of a sudden there was this stig-
ma attached to it, that you're not supposed to use it anymore," says John-
son. "Well, why not? I think it's because some of those really strong Miami
teams beat some Oklahoma option teams by throwing the ball. And that
was about it. Then they would say it's an offense for overmatched teams,
when you don't have equal talent. At Georgia Southern we had equal or bet-
ter talent than the team we were playing, and we went 62-10."
Ironically, Johnson would prove the overmatched theory in his next job.
In 2002 Johnson became head coach at Navy. The Midshipmen went 2-10
in Johnson's first year and then 43-19 in the next five. That got him hired at
Georgia Tech late in 2007, where he promised to bring the wishbone back to
major-college football. In his first season at Georgia Tech, in 2008, the Yel-
low Jackets finished 9-4 and Johnson was named ACC Coach of the Year;
in 2009, he finished 11-3— all the while running the triple option. He kept
his promise. The 'bone still had some pop in it.
