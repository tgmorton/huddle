Miami, Fla.
\
HE NEW Orleans
Saints
Oct. 25, 2009
arrived
in South
Florida
on this afternoon unbeat-
en in five games to begin
the 2009 season. They had scarcely been tested and possessed the league's
most lethal passing game. Head coach-play-caller Sean Payton's hybrid
offense (a mix of systems, including the West Coast and Coryell) had been
made surgical in the hands of veteran quarterback Drew Brees. The Saints
had scored six passing touchdowns in the season opener against Detroit
and hadn't let up. Next would be the Miami Dolphins, who had bounced
back from an 0-3 start to win two consecutive games.
What happened in the
first two quarters of this game veered sig-
nificantly from the anticipated script. The Dolphins' 3-4 defense, with
natural edge pass rushers Jason Taylor and Joey Porter lined up as the
outside linebackers, sold out on the run to focus instead on effectively
pressuring Brees. Late in the first half the Saints trailed 24-3 before
scoring late to narrow the gap to 24-10. In those first 30 minutes the
Saints ran 30 offensive plays, the Dolphins 32; the Saints threw 22 pass-
es and ran eight times; the Dolphins threw 10 passes and ran 22 times.
In the second half, though, the roles were reversed. The Dolphins vir-
tually abandoned the ground game—inexplicably so—with inexperienced
105

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
quarterback Chad Henne throwing 26 passes; Miami ran the ball just sev-
en times. The Saints, meanwhile, also changed their strategy entirely and
employed a more balanced split of 19 runs and 16 passes, enabling them
to seize control of the line of scrimmage, slow the Dolphins' pass rush and
stage a furious rally to win the game, 46-34. The Saints pounded Miami
for 115 yards on the ground in the second half, transforming themselves
at halftime from stunt plane into bulldozer.
After the game the Saints' offensive linemen sat in their dressing cu-
bicles in the belly of Land Shark Stadium stripping tape from knees
and ankles. As with most of their peers on the O-line, they look to be an
unathletic lot, with their thick legs and jiggling bellies (for power, and
for protection). Yet they remain, as always, the foundation on which
every offensive play is built. Jon Stinchcomb, the hulking right tackle,
stiffened and fell backward onto a chair in the middle of an interview.
"Little cramp there," he said, pointing to his left foot, which was twitch-
ing like a hooked trout on a dry dock.
The game had turned into their kind of contest. In the second half the
offensive line had been freed from the passive restraint of pass-blocking,
backpedaling to try to control an onrushing defender; instead the line
was allowed to attack the defense to create holes for the running game.
Ask any offensive lineman at any level if he would rather run-block or
pass-block and you'll get the same answer. "Being able to run the ball
sets up everything in this league," said Saints left tackle Jermon Bush-
rod, enjoying the victory. "When you push out and run the ball, teams
just can't load up and rush the passer the way they were doing in the
first half. And every offensive lineman would rather hit somebody than
sit back and get hit. That's human nature."
Said Stinchcomb, "Anytime you're able to have some offensive bal-
ance and keep a defense respecting both aspects of your game, you're
going to have more success. We see that time and time again. Today, we
had to get the game back to a manageable point differential, then we
could mix the run in with the pass."
This is hardly a new concept;
it is fundamental football. Yet for the
Saints of '09, dedication to the run was a recent addition to their rep-
ertoire. The Payton-Brees passing game, in which the Saints elevated a
group of relatively unheralded wide receivers to a potent unit, had made
106

LOMBARDI'S POWER SWEEP
the Saints competitive. The running game, with backs Mike Bell, Reg-
gie Bush and Pierre Thomas and a stout offensive line executing a zone-
blocking scheme, made them whole.
These Saints represented a something of a reversal of the obvious
and essential order of football. Historically, the run came first, followed
by the pass. The sport is built on the idea of physical domination, with
the running game at its core. Yet as modern football moved into the
mid-1950s, the pass and run were in a subtle tug- of-war for ownership
of the game. Passing was
still simplistic, but seductive. The running
game had grown stale.
Coaches anticipated the birth of something new and innovative to
carry the running game into the latter half of the 20th century. What
they got, instead, was a very old school coach, Vince Lombardi, build-
ing the power sweep from the same principles that had once made the
single wing effective. First he used his power sweep in New York as an
assistant with the Giants and then, more famously, in Green Bay after
arriving there in 1959.
In short, the new phase in the evolution of the ground game wasn't
new, it was old. It wasn't complex, it was simple. It was football at its most
basic: survival of the strongest and the toughest.
THEY SAT inside a picnic shelter on a summer afternoon signing auto-
graphs. Max McGee, then 69, affixed his signature to a stack of artist's
prints depicting his epic—and unlikely—two-touchdown performance
in the first Super Bowl. "I sort ofremember that day," says McGee, who
notoriously stayed out all night on the eve of the game, delivering a
well-practiced line with convincing fogginess. Paul Hornung, 66, sits
next to McGee, signing a classic picture from I960, in which he is run-
ning onto the field, bright sunshine illuminating his blond curls, eye
black edging his cheekbones, a green-and-yellow Green Bay Packers
helmet dangling from his right hand.
Hornung, the erstwhile Golden Boy, is not so Golden anymore, and
certainly not a boy. His head is still full of hair, but it is silvery now.
McGee is bald, much as he was as a player, and he reminds the crowd
with vaudevillian style, dipping his mug toward Hornung, "He's the
one with the gray hair. I don't have any gray hair," says McGee. It is a
107

small crowd in a small town, and an adoring one. Chuck Roeske, 62, a
maintenance machinist at the local Veterans Administration hospital,
regards them with awe. "These guys were the greatest," he says. "Real
football players."
The Green Bay Packers of Vince Lombardi left a lasting imprint
on football in America, images handed down through four decades of
fans. Most often it is the image of the man in the glasses with the gaps
in his teeth, fedora atop his head, pacing the sideline. And no part of
Packers lore has a more vibrant afterlife than Lombardi's prized cre-
ation, the power sweep, the chalkboard emblem of the first dynasty of
the modern NFL.
It was this single play that would represent the cool efficiency that
made Lombardi's Packers great, and
it was these charismatic Pack-
ers that gave the NFL a foundation on which to build its future, of-
fering a '50s simplicity and sociability as comfortable as a suburban
backyard cookout. For opposing defenders, though, the power sweep
wasn't comfortable at all—that apparent simplicity was instead almost
maddening. Yet the sweep had
its own sweet complexity, perfected
only through endless repetition. "It wasn't a simple play," says Ron
Kramer, the 6' 3", 234-pound tight end from Michigan who played on
Lombardi's first six teams. "But when you run it 25 or 30 or 50 times a
day, it starts to become very simple, and that's exactly what we did."
The sweep was most often run by Hornung, the dashing, dynamic
1956 Heisman Trophy winner from Notre Dame. For so many football
fans
it is an indelible picture: Hornung, the ball in the crook of his
arm, dancing to the outside; guards Fuzzy Thurston and Jerry Kramer,
each barely bigger than a modern wide receiver, barreling out in front;
fullback Jim Taylor and right tackle Forrest Gregg in their trench labor
being swallowed along the path. It is arguably the most lasting image
in NFL history.

fab 1959
LOMBARDI'S PACKERS gathered for the first time in the summer of
1959, the vestiges of a franchise that had won just a single game in the
108

LOMBARDl'S POWER SWEEP
1958 season and hadn't had a winning season since going 6-5-1 under
Curly Lambeau in 1947. Lombardi was the head coach, but he had run
the New York Giants' offense under Jim Lee Howell and he would run
the Packers' offense as well. He introduced the sweep to his team on
the very first day of practice. "He told us, 'This will be the key to the
whole running game,' " recalls Hornung. "He told us it was something
we had to do perfectly."
It was no surprise to the Packers' veterans. They had seen the Giants
run the sweep with Frank Gifford carrying the ball. "Lombardi showed us
films of the Giants every day," says Hornung. "We watched Frank Gifford
run that play over and over again. He brought his whole offense with him
from New York to Green Bay, but the sweep was the thing he really made
us work on. And we knew it was coming."
In truth, the sweep went back much further than the Giants, back to
the roots of modern power football, the single wing. Lombardi played
college football at Fordham from 1933 through
'36. He was a
5' 8",
185-pound guard on the Rams' offensive line that was nicknamed the
Seven Blocks of Granite. During that same era, Jock Sutherland over-
saw a dynasty of sorts at Pittsburgh from 1924 through '38. Running
the single wing, Sutherland took Pitt to four Rose Bowls and won pieces
of several national titles.
The single wing revolutionized football with intricate backfield fak-
ing and ballhandling but also featured punishing offensive line play
that included athletic pulling and trapping, as well as fierce double
teams at the point of attack. Single wing backs were also called upon
to read blocks and cut back accordingly. Lombardi was enamored of all
these elements, even as a college opponent. "I was impressed playing
against the Single-Wing sweep the way those Pittsburgh teams of Jock
Sutherland ran
it," Lombardi wrote, together with WC. Heinz, in his
book Run to Daylight! "And I was impressed again in those early days
of attending coaching clinics when the Single-Wing was discussed. To-
day our sweep has a lot of those Sutherland qualities, the same guard-
pulling techniques, the same ball-carrier cutback feature, and there's
nothing spectacular about it. It's just a yard-gainer."
If Lombardi's interest in the sweep began at Fordham, it was solidi-
fied at West Point, where Lombardi worked from 1949 through 1953
109

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi, David Maraniss
writes, "Since his days at West Point, [Lombardi] had based his coach-
ing philosophy on Red Blaik's belief that perfection came with sim-
plicity. The theory was to discard the immaterial and refine those few
things that one did best." He put the sweep in with the Giants in 1955,
Gifford's fourth year with the team.
In
Lombardi's own
writings he makes
it
clear
that
the power
sweep—49 Sweep in the Packers' playbook—would be his core play
and that its proper execution would achieve not only yardage but larger
goals. "It is our number one play, our lead play, that 49 Sweep," he wrote
in Run to Daylight!
It is our bread-and-butter, top-priority play, the one we have to make
go and the one our opponents know they must stop. All teams have
them. Detroit has that fullback slant for Nick Pietrosante, the Bears
have that pitchout for Willie Galimore, the Browns use that fullback
wedge with Jimmy Brown. Continued success with it, of course, makes
a number one play because from that success stems your confidence.
And behind all that is the basic truth that it expresses you as a coach
and the players as a team and that they know full well when they ex-
ecute it and it's completely right.
"THAT FIRST training camp in '59," recalls Ron Kramer, the tight end,
"we had a seven-man blocking sled on the practice fields. Every day we
would go out at the start of practice, and we'd get on the seven-man
sled. Bart Starr or one of the other quarterbacks would stand off to
the side, calling out a cadence: Set. Four-22. Hut! Hut! And we would
crack into that sled. Lombardi would be standing on the sled, and he'd
yell, 'O.K., one more time!' And we would do it again until finally Lom-
bardi was smiling and he'd say, 'That's the way I want it done!'!"
Inside the repetition was a precise division of labor. "In football,
no one can take all the credit for making a play successful; that's the
beauty of the game," says Kramer. "It has to be everybody together."
Over time the Packers' sweep has come to be most closely identified
with the two pulling guards, Thurston and Jerry Kramer. "But every-
body had a key block," says Ron Kramer. "Everybody had to do a job."
110

LOMBARDl'S POWER SWEEP
body had a key block," says Ron Kramer. "Everybody had to do a job."
(Devotees of vintage reels from NFL Films may recall a classic piece
on Lombardi in which he is standing at a chalkboard, apparently out-
doors on a practice field, diagramming the power sweep: What we're
trying to get is a seal here and a seal here and run this play in
.
.
. the
.
.
.
alley. In this instance the importance of the precision of each assign-
ment is clear, and the scene has routine stamped all over it.)
In his book he writes, "I've diagrammed it so many times and coached
it so much and watched it evolve so often since I first put it in with the
Giants eight years ago that I think I see it in my sleep."
The sweep was run from a splitback formation, with a flanker (it was
usually Boyd Dowler) to the strong side, outside the tight end. (Ron
Kramer, whose legacy would become entwined with this play, was re-
turning from a year of military service and first had to beat out Gary
Knafelc to get the starter's job.) The line was balanced, a tackle and a
guard on each side of the center. Starr was under center, and the backs
were split behind him. In the early years those backs were most often
Hornung and Jim Taylor, with Hornung on the left and Taylor on the
right, each lined up on the outside leg of the guard in front of him. The
sweep was most often run to the right, largely because Hornung ran it
better—and Taylor, a tough-as-nails inside hammer, excelled at every-
thing else, particularly running between the tackles.
"And there was another reason for running right," says Hornung. "If
you ran it to the left, you'd have Max McGee out there blocking for me on
some linebacker and, crissakes, nobody wanted that."
While the mythology of the sweep exalts the pulling guards, in
truth the three most challenging blocks were delivered by tight end
Ron Kramer, fullback Taylor and center Jim Ringo. Most important
of those was Kramer, who at the snap was responsible for blocking
the player across from him, usually the outside linebacker. "Never
allow penetration to the inside or over you hard," wrote Lombardi in
describing the tight end's role. "If he penetrates inside, he knocks off
both our pulling guards." In other words, the play would be blown
up. To the inside of Ron Kramer, right tackle Gregg and Taylor were
responsible for working as a pair—in a style that, looking back,
is
suspiciously similar to the "zone blocking schemes" that were yet to
111

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
prevent the defensive end from disrupting beyond the line of scrim-
mage. If any of these three players failed, the sweep could not work,
and Jerry Kramer and Thurston, the pulling guards, would not ramble
into space ahead of Hornung.
Jim Hanifan was coaching high school football in California in 1959,
watching the Green Bay sweep from afar; he would later become one
of the most successful offensive line coaches in league history. "I tried
to coach that damn sweep in college ball," says Hanifan. "It was really,
really hard to do. You were asking for two key blocks from the tight
end and from the lead back and tackle. And both of those blocks had
to be successful, and that was not easy to get done. Green Bay in those
early years with Lombardi had a great, great tight end in Ron Kramer,
and he would just kick your ass. And then Gregg and Taylor usually
did a good job, and then you get the guards out there and make some
money for yourself."
On a Friday fall afternoon in 2009 Ron Kramer was driving from
Chicago to Green Bay with his old pal Hornung and became just a little
bit emotional when recalling Lombardi's appreciation for his work on
the edge of the sweep. Said Kramer, "The nicest compliment that Vince
Lombardi ever gave me—and it gives me chills to think about it—was
that having Kramer at tight end was like having 12 men on the field
because he didn't have to worry about double-teaming anybody. That
meant so much to me when he said that."
Ringo's block at center was also difficult. He had to execute what
is called a "reach block" (extending laterally to block a defender who
is in a seemingly advantageous position), in this case on the play-side
defensive tackle to prevent him from achieving any penetration. Once
all of these blocks were delivered—and it all happened in less than two
seconds—guards Kramer (from the right) and Thurston (from the left)
were free to barrel down the line of scrimmage, turn upfield and pick
off defenders in the open field. And they were brilliant at doing it, as
was Hornung at reading their blocks.
The exchange from Starr to Hornung was a straight handoff. Starr
would reverse pivot—turning to his left—while Hornung began running.
Starr would stick the ball into Hornung's belly with his left hand. "I'd
run two steps to the right and then as soon as I got the ball, I'd deepen
112

LOMBARDI'S POWER SWEEP
run two steps to the right and then as soon as I got the ball, I'd deepen
by a yard and a half," says Hornung. "That would give me and the guards
both a chance to make a cut off Ron's block. We all had to watch what
Ron was doing with the linebacker. If he took the linebacker inside, me
and Jerry and Fuzzy would run outside. If he took him outside, we'd run
up inside. I think everything moved quicker to the inside. But the whole
key was watching Ron and that linebacker."
The play was made even more effective by the possibility that Hor-
nung might throw the ball, an "option pass" in the language of the
day. He had been a quarterback at Notre Dame, and though he was
primarily a runner and threw only 55 passes in his entire nine-season
NFL career, the threat of the option pass helped keep cornerbacks
honest and enabled flanker Dowler to deliver a better block on the
deepest defender.
The sweep was the backbone of Lombardi's attack, operated by
the perfect combination of athletes. Ron Kramer was a horse, bigger
and stronger than most outside linebackers at the time. Gregg was
a powerful man-on-man blocker. Thurston and Jerry Kramer were
not giants (247 and 245 pounds, respectively), but they were terrific
athletes, capable of engaging defensive backs in the open field. "It
wasn't a game-breaking play," says Ron Kramer. "It was a solid five,
six, seven-yard play every time. It was made to keep the ball and wear
out the defense."
Says Hornung: "Lombardi loved to show us the sweep on film after
the game. Boy, he got his jollies when we did it right. More that any-
thing else, I think."
Bill Yeoman, who in the 1960s invented the triple option Houston
veer, recalls attending a Lombardi clinic in the late 1950s. "Vince would
get so excited talking about the sweep," says Yeoman, "I thought he was
going to have an orgasm right there at the chalkboard."
Lombardi's beloved sweep set up two other plays: Right 47 (off-
tackle, with a lead blocker) and Right 43 (a quick-hitter straight up
the middle with the lead back), each requiring less finesse than the
sweep. Taylor was a battering ram on both, and he ran for more than
1,000 yards in each of five consecutive seasons from I960 through '64.
Together the sweep and the inside power plays formed a devastating
113

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
On this foundation Lombardi quickly righted the Packers. After a
five-game losing streak in the middle of the 1959 season, Lombardi's
first in Green Bay, the Packers closed with four straight wins to fin-
ish at 7-5. They went 8-4 and lost to the Eagles 17-13 in the '60 NFL
Championship Game but returned the next year to win 11 games in the
regular season and crush the Giants 37-0 for the team's first champi-
onship since '44. And the power sweep was the signature play of the
new champions. In his book Lombardi referred to
it as the "pay-off-
the-mortgage" play.
But as early as that first championship season, Lombardi saw other
teams begin to adapt, as he wrote in Run to Daylight!
In 1961
it started falling off a little as play recognition by the de-
fense began to develop. But in that 1961 championship game against
the Giants, Hornung made one 19-yard gain with it. Then the Giants
adjusted and when they drove Jim Katcavage, their left end, upfield
hard, we used the counter [with Taylor]. We ran inside instead of
outside, using cross-blocking, because a play's value is not only in
that play itself, but in the counter it sets up.
The Green Bay power sweep would ultimately fall victim not only
to film and familiarity but also to the quickening of the modern game.
"It was a slow-developing play, where Hornung would run outside
to the numbers, where, we used to say, the grass is still green," says
Howard Mudd, an offensive lineman with the San Francisco 49ers of
the 1960s and later a respected NFL line coach. "It was a play that
went sideways and up."
Defenses became faster. Inside-out pursuit became a more com-
mon factor in defending outside players. If a halfback like Hornung
waited
for blockers, he would be caught by backside and inside
chasers. As speed became paramount and precision less valuable, a
new sweep— a quicker, more dynamic sweep—would take root, half
a continent away.
But the Green Bay power sweep left a deep imprint on the soul of
the sport and on the men who ran it. Hornung, riding shotgun on the
drive with Kramer back up to Green Bay, told tall tales on his old bud-
114

LOMBARDI'S POWER SWEEP
drive with Kramer back up to Green Bay, told tall tales on his old bud-
dy and then made sure that a passenger understood that he might be
stretching the truth. But not about everything. As the flat, Midwestern
landscape raced past the car windows, Hornung declared, "They never
did stop our sweep."

USC SWEEP RIGHT
At Southern Cal in the '70s and '80s, the Trojans incorporated
many oftheprinciples ofthe Lombardi sweep but used their speed
to hit the defense more quickly. Both guardspulled, but unlike in
the Lombardi sweep, only theplay-side guardattempted to get out
infront ofthe ballcarrier andmove downfield. (Sometimes the
Trojanspulled the backside tackle as well) The USC sweep was
runfrom an Iformation in which the quarterback wouldpitch
the ball to the tailback (unlike the Packers handoff), enabling the
runner to get outside more quickly.
