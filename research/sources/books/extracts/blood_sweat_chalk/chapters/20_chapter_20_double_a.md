DOUBLE A
GAP BLITZ
All the late nights inJimJohnson's office paid off in
what may be the ultimate defensive weapon— so far
to Dallas and Green Bay, games in which their defense gave up a total of
80 points. In Week 3 they had trailed Washington 17-3 at halftime, only
to rally to a desperate 24-17 victory that, in essence, kept their season vi-
able, given that the long-term prognosis for NFL teams opening 0-3 is ex-
ceptionally poor. But it was a week later in creaky Giants Stadium that the
team's season—which would climax with an upset win over the unbeaten
New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII—truly turned.
Their opponents that Sunday night were the Philadelphia Eagles, who
had also recovered from an 0-2 start with a 56-21 destruction of the Detroit
Lions. The core of the Eagles' 2004 NFC championship team was
still in
place, Donovan McNabb
still the quarterback. The Eagles could not have
imagined that they would enter the NFL record book that evening, but when
the night was over, the Giants had tied an NFL record with 12 quarterback
sacks, including a team-record six by fifth-year defensive end Osi Umenyio-
ra. "And it wasn't just the six sacks he got," Giants linebacker Antonio Pierce
said that day. "He probably caused the other six sacks too."
In the short view, perhaps,
it was just one man's incredible perfor-

mance. But in the longer view, the last day of September 2007 was one of
those moments when football evolution, generally a gradual unfolding of
innovation and change, reaches critical mass and surges forward.
The Giants defense that took down McNabb 12 times was coached by
first-year defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, who dialed up an end-
less array of blitzes to confuse the Eagles' offensive line, including, among
the victims, substitute left tackle Winston Justice, who was playing for
the injured Tra Thomas that day. Justice, who would become a starter,
remembers the game
all too painfully. "It seemed like they came from
everywhere that day," he says. "It wasn't one guy or one blitz."
But it was one scheme that set the tone: the Double A Gap Blitz, in which
two linebackers blitz—or threaten to blitz—the quarterback from positions
on the left and right shoulders of the offensive center (the "A" gaps), trying
to get immediate pressure via the shortest route and forcing the offense into
a series of quick and potentially dangerous decisions. "We ran it a bunch of
times in that game, with Antonio Pierce and Kawika Mitchell in the A gaps,"
recalls Spagnuolo. "It presented some problems for the Eagles, obviously."
The Giants' defensive game plan had been devised just that week, but the
foundation was laid eight years earlier when Spagnuolo was hired as a de-
fensive quality control assistant—the bottom of the coaching food chain—for
the Eagles. The head coach was Andy Reid. The defensive coordinator was
57-year-old Jim Johnson.
It was Johnson who would teach Spagnuolo de-
fense, and influence the entire league in the first decade of the new century.

September 1959
THE DOUBLE A Gap is a product of many elements in the sport that came
before it, but it was crystallized in one man's brainstorm.
Upon his arrival at the University of Missouri in the fall of 1959, com-
ing from his home in Maywood,
111., Jim Johnson played both ways-
quarterback and safety—on a good freshman team, then joined the varsity
under coach Dan Devine for the best three-year run in school history.
The Tigers went 11-0 in I960, won the Big Eight title and beat Navy
21-14 in the Orange Bowl to finish ranked No. 5 in the nation; Johnson was
a sophomore safety and backup quarterback. A year later he started at safety
224

on a 7-2-1 team whose two losses were by a combined total of eight points; as
a senior he was the starting quarterback when Mizzou went 8-1-2 and beat
Georgia Tech in the Bluebonnet Bowl. In that senior year of '62, Johnson
played in a backfield that included future NFL personnel executive Bill Tobin
(Johnson's best friend) and future pro players Andy Russell (who would star
at linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers) and Johnny Roland (who played
eight years at running back in the NFL with the Cardinals and the Giants).
That team pounded opponents by running out of the Delaware Wing T.
"We ran the power sweep all day," says Tobin. Johnson attempted a mere
33 passes in his entire senior season, completing 12. Tobin was the Tigers'
leading receiver, with three catches. But because Johnson had been a de-
fensive player the year before, he had seen football both from the deep
secondary and from the offensive backfield, leaving him ideally qualified
to understand certain nuances of the sport. "He was always very obser-
vant," says Tobin. "He understood everything he was seeing out there."
After two years fighting unsuccessfully for a spot in the NFL, Johnson
was named the first head coach at Missouri Southern State College, build-
ing the program in 1967 and fielding its first team in '68. He subsequently
spent four years at Drake, four years at Indiana and seven at Notre Dame,
where Devine was the head coach. Johnson's first NFL job was from 1986
to '93 with the Cardinals, where his mentor was the respected but conser-
vative Fritz Shurmur. When Johnson went to the Indianapolis Colts in the
mid-'90s, his defensive philosophy took a sharp turn. Frustrated at getting
nickel-and-dimed on long drives by the evolving West Coast offense, John-
son began conceiving unorthodox blitzes.
On Nov. 16, 1997, the 0-10 Colts, struggling with injuries, knocked off the
defending Super Bowl champion Packers 41-38 at the RCA Dome in India-
napolis. Johnson blitzed all day, and his defense gave up 441 yards in offense
but also sacked Brett Favre three times, intercepted two passes and left a
lasting impression on Green Bay assistant coach Andy Reid. "We scored a lot
of points that day, but Jim destroyed our protections with his blitzes," says
Reid. "I told myself that day, If I'm ever lucky enough to get a head coaching
job in this league, that guy is going to be my defensive coordinator."
Two years later Reid was hired to coach the Eagles and made good
on his promise, hiring Johnson, then 57, as defensive coordinator. They
would work together for a decade, an eternity in the high-pressure, high-

turnover NFL. Johnson would die in July of 2009 of complications from
melanoma; by then he and Reid had made the playoffs seven times, and
reached the Super Bowl at the end of the 2004 season.
On a December morning in 2009, Reid sat in an office at the Eagles'
headquarters and recalled his friend and colleague. "The first time I met
Jim was in Hawaii at the Pro Bowl, and it was before that game in India-
napolis," said Reid. "We were at the pool at the hotel and our families
were there, and I just went up and introduced myself.
"Right from the beginning," says Reid, "Jim was real. From a coaching
standpoint, I didn't want to get in the way of his creativity. Jim was a brilliant
guy. And for me, as a young coach [Reid was 40 when he took the job], Jim
supported everything I was doing. It was never about offense versus defense.
It was always about us. I probably did some things that Jim was thinking,
Holy Toledo, what's this guy doing? But he never said anything like that."
Johnson installed multiple blitzes as soon as he arrived. He focused
most of his pregame preparation on an opponents' pass protections and
designing blitzes to exploit their weaknesses. "Jim wasn't worried about
what teams did in the running game or how they ran pass routes," says
Spagnuolo. "Instead, he studied protections and attacked them." Johnson's
peers chided him about his blitz-crazy schemes. They told him it was his
"retirement defense," saying that because he was getting up in age, he
didn't mind taking risks—he'd be retiring soon anyway.
He spent time talking to offensive line coaches and struck up a particu-
lar friendship with Eagles O-line coach Juan Castillo. "Jim and Juan would
get together all the time and talk about pass protections," says Reid, "and
then Jim would go back down to his office and create the blitz."
On the practice field Johnson was tough on players. He despised men-
tal errors. "My first minicamp as a rookie, I was supposed to blitz on this
particular play," says Eagles strong safety Quintin Mikell, who arrived in
Philly in 2003. "Well, I'm trying to learn the city and my teammates and
the defensive system, and I didn't blitz. I figured it would be O.K. It was
not O.K. Jim came up to me, yelling and cursing me out: 'Don't you know
what you're supposed to be doing there? You're supposed to be on a fuck-
ing blitz!' Man, he gave it to me. But I'll tell you what else: If you got beat
because the offense made a great play, he would not take you down. He
understood that sometimes the offense makes a play."
226

DOUBLE A GAP BLITZ
Says Spagnuolo, who worked under Johnson, "He was hard on players
and hard on coaches, but he had a heart bigger than you can imagine. He
was tough on everybody because he was trying to get us ready for what we
were going to face on Sunday."
The Double A Gap came in 2001. It was Johnson's ultra-aggressive ex-
tension of everything he'd been doing, first conjured when Johnson asked
himself this question: Instead of a single blitzer on the edge or a single
blitzer in the middle, why not load up the middle of the formation? The
first time Johnson called
it in a game, Eagles defensive tackle Darwin
Walker came unblocked for a sack. From 2000 to '08 the Eagles had 390
sacks, second in the NFL. In '07 Spagnuolo moved on to the Giants as de-
fensive coordinator and built on the Double A, using it as a foundation for
the pressure defense that would sack Tom Brady five times and keep him
under siege all night in the Giants' 17-14 upset win in Super Bowl XLII.
"The thing about the Double A," says Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter,
who was with the team whenJohnson installed the scheme and rejoined them
in '09 for his third tour, "is that it doesn't really have a major weakness."
JIM JOHNSON was gone before the 2009 season began, having passed away
shortly before the Eagles broke training camp in Bethlehem, Pa. But his leg-
acy was firmly established. NFL defense had become a game not of whether
to blitz, but ofwhich blitz to use. "Right now, in the NFL, it's blitzkrieg," said
Washington Redskins offensive line coach Joe Bugel, a 35-year league coach-
ing veteran, in the fall of 2009. "If you're going to have your quarterback
throw out of seven-step drop, you better have about 12 offensive linemen."
The Double A Gap Blitz is one of the most popular among many blitz
options for aggressive defenses (which now means all defenses). It usu-
ally begins with the defense in "nickel personnel," or five defensive backs.
There are also usually four down linemen and two linebackers in a 4-2-5
configuration (although it can be run from various other sets). As the of-
fense reaches the line of scrimmage, the two linebackers move menacing-
ly into the two A gaps. If the quarterback is under center, the 'backers can
probably smell his breath, and he theirs. "At that point it's mental gym-
nastics," says former Raiders and Bucs head coach Jon Gruden. "There's
no doubt there's going to be some penetration in the middle if they blitz,
and it's going to mess with your blocking schemes."
227

The offense has several options, none of them ideal.
• Gap (or squeeze) protection, in which both guards block down inside, put-
ting three big bodies on the two blitzing linebackers. This, however, forces
the offensive tackles to block down as well, in order to pick up the two de-
fensive tackles, and it leaves some combination of running backs and tight
ends to deal with edge-rushing defensive ends like Dwight Freeney, Jared
Allen or Elvis Dumervil. "They're trying to create a negative one-on-one
matchup with your halfback," says Broncos quarterback Kyle Orton.
• Slide protection, in which the entire offensive line slides one way, with
the center picking up one blitzer and one guard picking up the other. The
same problem results with one defensive end left rushing against a run-
ning back or, at best, a tight end or H-back.
• Straight protection, in which the center takes one blitzer, and the other
one is allowed a free release to the running back, who must make a key
block in the quarterback's lap. "This blitz has changed what you need in a
running back," says Bugel. "He's got to be able to pass-block, or you really
can't have him on the field."
Even if the back stops the blitzing linebacker, his involvement in that
block prevents him from helping out on any other pass rusher. "You like
to have your running back chip the defensive end, stick an elbow in the
guy's ribs off the edge," says Gruden. "But if the defense shows a Double
A Gap, that running back is going to be too late to chip, so you're one-on-
one with Dumervil or Freeney on the outside."
Another consideration: It's perilous to leave the quarterback under cen-
ter. "It's imperative that you get into the shotgun, to give the quarterback
some breathing room," says former Giants head coach and Ravens offen-
sive coordinator Jim Fassel. "But you really need to know what situations
you might see it in, because it's hard to check to the 'gun."
The most devilish aspect of the Double A is that the linebackers don't even
need to blitz in order to make the play effective. "And you can't be sure," says
Gruden. "Defenses aren't stupid. Those linebackers will get up there in the
A gaps, but they won't have blinking red lights on their helmets with signs say-
ing, 'I'm coming.' " Because the Double A threatens to bring pressure so close
to the quarterback and so quickly, the offense must adjust to one of the above
protections on the assumption that the A gap rushers are going to blitz.
"Once those two linebackers are down inside, [the offense has] got to
228

DOUBLE A GAP BLITZ
deal with them and tip their hand," says Mikell. "That's the whole thing
with the Double A, make them adjust and then attack." Empty backfield
sets, with five wide receivers, make it difficult to adjust, and so are clearly
impractical against teams that favor the Double A.
There are numerous other variations of this blitz. In '07, Spagnuolo
rotated defensive ends Justin Tuck and Umenyiora into the A gaps and
linebackers Pierce and Mitchell to the edge, creating an even more daunt-
ing mismatch—Tuck or Umenyiora on a running back or center—on the
inside. The Giants called that combination Bombs. Other teams have
dropped both 'backers into coverage and rushed a safety late, after the
offense has committed to countering the A gap rushers.
The best way to exploit the Double A is to effectively block it, a difficult
proposition. Or, says Gruden, "If you're using it against a CEO-type quar-
terback, like a Peyton Manning or Drew Brees, who understands how to
pick up blitzes, you can have problems because you're short of personnel
in coverage and they'll get rid of the ball quickly."
Says Trotter, "Teams run quick screens, slants, things like that, because
normal pass routes take too long and the pressure is right on the quar-
terback. Jim Johnson always told us, 'You take away great receivers by
getting in the quarterback's face.' "
THEY ECHO his messages like that in Philadelphia. Around the league
they copy his plays. Johnson would appreciate that. During game week
he could always be found in his office long after practice, working the
coordinator's customary hours, searching for seams in somebody's of-
fense. "He brought an energy and an enthusiasm to figuring things
out," says Reid. "The players couldn't wait to hear how Jim was going
gash 'em this week."

POWERRUN RIGHT (NO HUDDLE)
VS. DIME DEFENSE
The '80s Cincinnati Bengals used the no-huddle more often andmore
effectively than any team before or since. Coach Sam Wyche says he hadgreat
success by going to a quick snap on apower run immediately after converting
a third-and-long against a dime (six defensive backs) defense. Theploy here
is to quickly run two tight ends onto thefieldand remove two wide receivers
(from thepreviousplay), then line up in a two-tight endformation (though
anypower runningformation could be used) before the defense can change
personnel. The defense is stillstuck with six DBs andjust one linebacker, a
weak alignment against apower run.
