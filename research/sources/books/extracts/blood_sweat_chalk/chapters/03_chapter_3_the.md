THE
WILDCAT
The recent resurgence of an old idea has intriguing
portent— the end of the quarterback as we know him
embraces the essence of the game: size, speed and power versus tactical
strategy. Visiting Cheshire Academy is wearing white; home team West-
minster School is in black. Neither school benefits from the population
that would buttress a powerful football program; Cheshire has 324 stu-
dents in four high school grades, Westminster 385. But on this night, in
this season, Cheshire has bigger, faster athletes and would appear to be
the stronger team. Yet football is always a game in which there are two
ways to win—be better or be smarter.
Cheshire runs the popular spread offense, with a talented quarterback
throwing darts to tall, fast wide receivers in the middle of the Westmin-
ster defense. Westminster is running something from the Dark Ages of
football: a tight formation with a direct snap to a small, nimble senior
quarterback named Calvin Brownridge, who executes an array of roll-
out passes, keepers and quarterback dives. Execution keeps Westminster
close, and only a fourth-quarter pass interference call gives Cheshire the
opportunity to score a late touchdown and win a tight game, 19-14.

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Dennis Daly, who has coached football at the college and high school levels
for more than three decades, shouts at a writer covering the game, "Tell
Coach Hugh Wyatt you saw his offense in action. And it worked."
SEVERAL WEEKS earlier, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., the
New England Patriots, who the previous season had won 18 consecutive
games before losing to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl, hosted
the Miami Dolphins, 0-2 and on the cusp of panic in a league where 0-3
nearly guarantees missing the playoffs. (It's the same game Jeremy Gallon
was watching in Chapter 1.)
The Dolphins beat the Patriots 38-13, largely on the success of an
offensive
attack they had never used
before:
running back Ronnie
Brown as a shotgun quarterback, with quarterback Chad Pennington
shifted to a wide receiver position and running back Ricky Williams as
a wingback. They lined up in the formation six times and scored four
touchdowns—three on runs by Brown, one on a pass from Brown to tight
end Anthony Fasano.
After the game Dolphins offensive coordinator Dan Henning called
the offense the David Lee Special, after his quarterbacks coach, but some
media members recognized it as the same package that Lee had run at
Arkansas in the previous two seasons, where it was called the Wildcat, or
the Wild Hog, the latter in deference to the Arkansas nickname. Lee had
pitched the offense to Henning on the flight home from the Dolphins'
31-10 loss at Arizona the previous weekend. "It had never come up before
that week," Pennington would say later in that season. "I wasn't shocked,
because I had been following some of the things that college teams were
doing. But at the same time a lot of things don't carry over [to the NFL].
The fact is, we needed some offensive energy, and that gave it to us."
Patriots veteran safety Rodney Harrison told reporters after the game,
"It's something we hadn't seen. We tried to make adjustments. We
still
didn't stop it."
Patriots coach
Bill Belichick knew exactly what he was watching.
And he knew that colleges were experimenting with
it. "We knew this
stuff was out there. We knew somebody was going to try it. But you've
got limited practice time, and you just can't waste any of it preparing for
something that a team hasn't shown yet."

THE WILDCAT
NFL coaches—coaches at any level, in fact—are fond of the expression,
It's a copycat league. It is their default response in explaining any trend.
And
it's generally true. Within hours of the Dolphins' victory over the
Patriots, at least half a dozen teams were exploring the use of some sort of
Wildcat-style package in their offenses.
And the concept was not entirely new to the league. Other NFL
teams had dabbled with it in recent years, which made the Dolphins'
all-in more of a culmination than a founding. NFL teams had been
selectively direct-snapping to an alternate back for the better part of
a decade. LaDainian Tomlinson, a future Hall of Fame running back,
had taken direct snaps, and thrown touchdown passes, for the Char-
gers. The Patriots had used running back Kevin Faulk in the shotgun.
Belichick recalled that Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger ran
off-tackle from a shotgun formation in his rookie season, in 2004.
Hines Ward, a former high school quarterback, had also taken snaps
for the Steelers. But
it was the Dolphins who took the last step and
truly committed to the system, using the Wildcat on almost one out of
ten snaps in 2008—and scoring 20% of their touchdowns with it. And
many teams immediately followed.
The Baltimore Ravens put in plays for then-second-year quarterback
Troy Smith, the 2006 Heisman Trophy winner as a run-pass threat at
Ohio State. "We were trying to tap into what Troy has done well in the
past," said Ravens offensive coordinator Cam Cameron. The Kansas
City Chiefs scored a touchdown on a Wildcat-based play when tailback
Jamaal Charles took a direct snap and pitched on a reverse to wideout
Mark Bradley, who then threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to quarterback
Tyler Thigpen, who was flanked wide right. "Pretty exciting," says Thig-
pen. "When I got deep, I looked back and I was thinking, is he throwing
the ball to me?" The Atlanta Falcons ran several direct snap plays to
running back Jerious Norwood, a high school quarterback in Missis-
sippi. "You can hear the defenses just checking off like crazy, getting
ready for the run," Norwood says. "But I can throw it."
The philosophy of the Wildcat is based on simple math. Defenses
traditionally try to account for every possible ballcarrier and every gap.
In doing so, they disregard a quarterback under center (except in an
option system). "When you put a quarterback under center, you lose a
37

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
blocker, you lose a gap, offensively," says Belichick. "You basically play
with 10 men on offense. But when the quarterback is one of the runners,
whether
it's single wing or veer or wishbone, the defense runs out of
people to defend you."
The ancient roots of the system are obvious, as Belichick indicated:
the single wing. Snap the ball to a runner and let him carry it. The recent
renaissance is trickier to pinpoint. In the days following the Dolphins' un-
veiling of their Wildcat, attention was quickly focused on Lee, the team's
first-year quarterbacks coach. From Lee, the etymology of the offense was
traced back to Gus Malzahn, who was by then working as the offensive
coordinator at the University of Tulsa.
The desk in Malzahn's office at Tulsa is absolutely clean.
It is clean
because Malzahn spends almost no time in this room, but rather in the
meeting room next door, scrawling offensive sets on a white board and
studying tape in the darkness. Malzahn, 43 on this day in 2008, is a foot-
ball
lifer. He was a high school wide receiver in Fort Smith, Ark., and
walked on at the University of Arkansas in 1984. "I tried, but I wasn't
good enough," he says. He transferred to Henderson State College in
Arkadelphia, Ark., and graduated in '90.
Malzahn went straight into high school coaching. "Always wanted to
be a coach," he says. "Never wanted to do anything else." He coached for
five years—the last four as head coach—at Hughes High in the northeast
Arkansas delta. In 1996 he started a five-year run at Shiloh Christian High
in Springdale, Ark.; his teams won two state titles and roasted defenses
with a spread passing game. In 2001 he took his offense to Springdale
High, a national power.
Among Malzahn's players at Springdale was a fast flanker named Dusty
Johnson, who had also been a junior high quarterback. Malzahn rumi-
nated on creative ways to get Johnson the football and attack the defense.
Eventually Malzahn put Johnson in the shotgun and a ran variety of plays:
a quarterback power series, a reverse and a speed sweep to a wingback cut-
ting across the formation—exactly as the Dolphins would run seven years
later with Ronnie Brown handing off to Ricky Williams. "We had pretty
good success with it," says Malzhan. "People started asking me if I had any
background in the single wing. I didn't know what they meant."
Malzhan was named offensive coordinator at the University of Ar-

THE WILDCAT
kansas in 2005 and began effectively using the formation with Darren
McFadden (who would land in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders) in
the tailback position and Felix Jones (who would go to the Dallas Cow-
boys) as a wingback running the speed sweep. "I brought the quarter-
back power [run] and speed sweep with me to Arkansas," says Malzahn.
"One of my good friends coached McFadden and told me that McFadden
had some experience playing quarterback when he was younger. Well,
that's just the kind of guy you want back there because he's a threat to
throw it too. Felix Jones could
fly, so he was the perfect speed sweep
guy. In a key '06 game, McFadden rushed for 181 yards and two touch-
downs and threw for a third in a win over Tennessee. ESPN's GameDay
crew was in attendance. "My phone started ringing pretty good after
that game," says Malzahn.
The name Wildcat first popularly surfaced in that same 2006 season.
Malzahn's explanation for the name
is circuitous:
"I didn't call
it the
Wildcat when I was at Springdale. I think we called it Heavy. When I got
to Arkansas, they already had an unbalanced formation that they called
Wildcat.
I think they got that from Kansas State." (Kansas State's nick-
name is the Wildcats.) "I think we just kept that name," says Malzahn.
In a faraway corner of America, Hugh Wyatt vigorously disputes
Malzahn's ownership
of the
Wildcat,
classic
evidence
of the
liquid
nature
of football
innovation. Wyatt, born
in
1938,
is an
energetic,
entrepreneurial—and
just
slightly
eccentric—Yale
graduate who
has
coached high school football for 32 years and, in the summer of 2009,
was preparing to begin his second season as coach of the North Beach
Hyaks in Ocean Shores, Wash.
"I believe Gus Malzahn has a selective
memory," he says.
Wyatt played on the freshman football team at Yale in the 1950s and
then served as practice fodder for the varsity for three years. Upon grad-
uation he worked a decade in the business world before yielding to his
passion and returning to football in 1970. First he coached and operated
a semipro team in Maryland, and that earned him two years in front-
office positions with teams in the soon-to-be-defunct World Football
League. In 1976, at age 38, he started teaching and coaching at a small
high school in Oregon. In the ensuing 32 years—in addition to jobs in
Louisiana, Oregon and, of all places, Finland (where he coached football
39

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
for seven years and got his first look at the double wing offense that he
would refine and market)—he was a head coach at six high schools and
an assistant at four.
Wyatt has been a highly successful coach, often taking teams with
minimal resources and talent and using his tight-split, double wing
offense to maximize his team's chances. When he first began coach-
ing, he ran the Delaware wing T but gradually began molding the
double wing that became his signature offense. "What
I espouse
is
a derivation of the single wing," says Wyatt. "The blocking all comes
from the single wing."
In addition to his coaching success Wyatt sells DVDs that instruct
coaches on the process of installing the offense and conducts instruc-
tional clinics that are extremely popular among high school coaches.
Dennis Daly, the aforementioned Westminster School coach, faced
precisely the type of manpower deficit that Wyatt's double wing has
often overcome. In the fall of 2008 Westminster started the season
with
five consecutive victories despite playing teams with a decid-
ed size and speed advantage. "The offense gives us a chance to get
double teams at the point of attack," Daly says. "It's our best way to
equalize the game."
Yet for all the popularity of the double wing among high school coach-
es, it is the direct snap Wildcat series that has made Wyatt a true pioneer.
He says he first ran—and named—the package in the fall of 1997. He was
at the time the head coach at La Center High in Washington state, and
La Center's school mascot was the Wildcat.
In a magazine article in '98 Wyatt wrote,
Whenever you've thought about throwing a curve at an opponent, the idea
of running the Single Wing may have crossed your mind. Perhaps you've
actually seen it in action—after all, a handful of schools still run it. Or may-
be you've heard the old-timers talk about its legendary power and decep-
tion. You just know that its uniqueness alone would drive defenses crazy.
You'd like to look at it, but you just don't know how to start.
In that case, you might want to take a look at our "Wildcat" package.
Nicknamed for our school's mascot, it's our direct-snap package—and an
adjunct to the Double Wing system that we've been running since 1990.

THE WILDCAT
WYATT GOES on to describe an offensive package that includes a se-
ries in which one of his two wingbacks—who line up facing inward at a
45-degree angle, rather than directly facing the defense—runs across the
formation and takes a handoff before continuing on around the opposite
end. It is almost identical to Malzahn's Shiloh/Springdale/Arkansas speed
sweep. In the winter of 2009 Wyatt wrote on his website: "Over the years
I've explained and shown the Wildcat to hundreds of coaches at clinics
and camps, and sold numerous playbooks and videos. I haven't the slight-
est idea how many teams have actually run my Wildcat at one time or
another, but there's a lot of them, and they know how it got its name."
When Malzahn was asked if he had, indeed, picked up the Wildcat
from Hugh Wyatt, he said, "Hugh Wyatt. I've heard that name. Well, I'm
sure I got it from somewhere. I just couldn't tell you where."
If the name and creator of the Wildcat is in dispute, its place in foot-
ball is not. "The single wing type stuff is going to become more the norm
in the future," says veteran NFL coach and offensive coordinator Chan
Gailey. "Over the next 10 or 15 years
it's going to evolve because the
runner-thrower is the kind of quarterback that the college game is produc-
ing now. You don't find a ton of the six-three, six-four, drop-back, stand-
up passer. They're not in college, so we're not getting them up here."
When Cam Cameron was head coach of the Dolphins in 2006, he no-
ticed a sea change in the quarterback position at all levels of the sport.
"I saw little kids playing Pop Warner—seven, eight, nine years old, doing
the belly-read option from a shotgun," says Cameron. "I was absolutely
floored by the stuff they were doing so young."
But wait: Isn't there madness in exposing a $10-million-a-year quarter-
back to a succession of crushing hits at the NFL level. "The hitting really
is at a much higher level than college," says quarterback Pennington. "I
don't think you would last very long."
Says Cameron, "It's one thing to have Darren McFadden back there,
but your quarterback?
I don't know about that. Maybe [Florida's Tim]
Tebow can do it in this league."
The voices of the NFL cannot speak quickly or loudly enough in swat-
ting aside the concept of running from the quarterback position. Yet
coaches keep trying, whether in Lou Holtz's failed attempt to run the
outside veer option with the New York Jets three decades ago or the Ten-
41

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
nessee Titans' halfhearted attempt to incorporate Vince Young's feet into
their offense, along with his arm. And many in between. There is clearly
value, and seduction, in the idea of a pro quarterback who can throw and
run and also survive. The question is, can it be done, and with whom?
As he began his pursuit of a second Heisman Trophy at Florida in the
fall of 2009, the player who magnified this debate was Tim Tebow. Florida
won the national championship with Tebow as a freshman in '06. Media
fell over themselves in proclaiming coach Urban Meyer's offense the ul-
timate modern "spread" game (Chapter 15), but the quarterback running
game was pure throwback. Tebow took direct snaps and ran off-tackle,
just like George Gipp. Single wing groupies everywhere went wild when
Tebow threw a jump pass—running toward the line of scrimmage as if to
carry off-tackle, then jumping and throwing—for a touchdown against
LSU. Dick Kazmaier used to throw jump passes at Princeton; you can see
them right there in Ed Racely's Cape Cod garage. And here was Tebow
doing the same thing.
Tebow won the Heisman Trophy in '07, passing for 32 touchdowns
and running for 23, a true double threat, and at 6
? 2/2", 238 pounds, a
durable one. The professional game has evolved significantly in many
ways, but the quarterback position really has not. The ideal NFL quarter-
back remains an accurate thrower who can make decisions under pres-
sure and, if rushed, buy time in the pocket. For all its growth, the league
has not yet produced a player who is equally dangerous as a runner and
a passer. (Michael Vick? Vince Young? Please.) With the influx of single
wing-based offensive packages, the door is open. And at lower levels of
the game the position has continued to move closer to the Tebow model
than the statuesque Tom Brady version.
"There aren't many players who can run and throw," says Belichick.
"Tebow, obviously, is a special one. But you've got major questions, be-
cause if you're going to run him 15 times a game, how long will he last
before they break him in half? But he is obviously special, and
it's go-
ing to be very interesting to see what happens when he comes into this
league. Do you just run your regular offense and let him scramble when
he scrambles? Do you put in a few plays just for him? Or do you really
build an entire new offense around him?"
Tebow (who, to the surprise of many, was taken in the first round of
42

THE WILDCAT
the 2010 draft by the Denver Broncos) may or may not not be the player
who bridges the college game to the NFL. Kansas State's Michael Bishop,
a dynamic college player, couldn't do
it because he lacked the passing
skills. Vick was even more dynamic, but ultimately—thus far—has failed
for the same reason, caught between his spellbinding running skills and
his limited passing accuracy. He was a running back playing quarterback,
and that simply can't be anything more than a novelty.
Yet there are those who see the transition to a different kind of player,
and a different kind of offense, as inevitable. "There are only so many
plays in football; all we're doing is finding different ways to run them
all," says Gailey. "But there's no escaping the fact that high school and
college football are developing a different type of athlete. Pretty soon—
I
don't know how long, but pretty soon—somebody is going to find an
athlete who can run and throw and just take the conventional quarter-
back off the field."
