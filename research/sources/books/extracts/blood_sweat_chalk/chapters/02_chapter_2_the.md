THE
WINGT
The offense of the '50s was curated by a legend named
Tubby and elevated by a team of Fightin' Blue Hens
College, a tiny school about 100 miles west of Detroit, where he would be
a two-way lineman in the last decade of single wing dominance in college
football. An hour to the east, in Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan
was turning Tom Harmon into a Heisman Trophy winner in a single wing
backfield that included future Iowa coach Forest Evashevski and a 5' 7",
155-pound halfback named Dave Nelson.
Football innovation repeatedly proves itself the product of coincidence,
of personalities thrown together and forced to improvise strategy for the
sake of survival. In the fall of 1940, while Lude was playing college football
in a tiny backwater and Nelson was playing before 100,000 spectators in
the same backfield as one of the great tailbacks in the game's history, they
could never have known that a decade later they would together change
the course of offensive football.
Lude played three seasons at Hillsdale before spending three years
in the U.S. Marines. Nelson enlisted in the Naval Air Corps. Both were
discharged in the summer of 1946. Lude returned to Hillsdale for his de-
layed senior year, where Nelson, still just 26 years old, with his Michigan

pedigree, had been named the head coach. Nelson installed the single
wing, and Hillsdale went 7-1 in Lude's final college season. For Nelson's
second year at Hillsdale he made Lude, 25, his line coach. They coached
the single wing again, and the Chargers went 7-0-2, giving Nelson a two-
year record of 14-1-2.
(Back down the road in Ann Arbor, meanwhile, coach Fritz Crisler and
Michigan's single wing Mad Magicians, so named for their deft backfield
ball handling, went 9-0 in the regular season and crushed USC 49-0 in the
Rose Bowl. It was the convention of the time to crown national champions
before bowl games. Notre Dame was voted No. 1 by the Associated Press,
but Michigan was given the title in a postseason poll conducted by the AP.
The Mad Magicians are revered by single wing devotees as one of the most
skilled faking teams in the history of the offense. And they were the last
major-college team to win a national title running Pop Warner's offense).
In the wake of his success at Hillsdale, Nelson was hired as an assis-
tant coach at Harvard in 1948 and a year later as the head coach at the
University of Maine. He brought Lude with him to Maine as his line coach
and installed the single wing. The Black Bears went 2-4-1 in that first
year, and though they won the Yankee Conference with a 2-0-1 record,
Nelson, Lude and backfield coach Harold Westerman were unsure that
they should stay with the single wing.
"The biggest problem we had," says Lude,
"is that we kept going
through tailbacks. They were getting banged up. That's what happens
with the single wing—the tailback is going to get hit frequently." There
were other issues, as well, which would ultimately spell the demise of
the single wing at the upper levels of football. Maine did not have a do-
everything athlete like Harmon to play single wing tailback, and
it did
not have the backfield depth to distribute carries in the buzz-saw method
of truly effective single wing teams. Nelson, Lude and the Black Bears
needed another attack.
Throughout the 1940s the two dominant teams in college football had
been Army under head coach Earl (Red) Blaik and Notre Dame under Frank
Leahy. Each was running the full-house T formation, which was inexorably
replacing the single wing as the dominant formation in all higher levels of
football. (Famously, or notoriously, the Chicago Bears had run from the T for-
mation in their 73-0 NFL championship-game rout of the Washington Red-

THE WING T
skins in 1940, still the most lopsided title game in the history of the league.)
The T, which in its original form is largely regarded as the work of 19th
century football architect Walter Camp, put a quarterback under center,
from where he would distribute the ball to any one of three running backs.
It wasn't as tricky and deceptive as the single wing, but it put less pres-
sure on a single back. Its linemen were principally straight-ahead block-
ers, with
little of the complex double-teaming and trapping that made
the single wing effective. But it eliminated the need for a superathlete at
tailback, and it was working at Notre Dame and Army. So in the spring of
1950, as Lude recalls, "Coach Nelson sent me and Harold Westerman out
on the road to learn from Leahy."
Come the summer of 1950, Nelson and Lude were convinced that they
would put a quarterback under center. "Although," says Lude, "none of
us even knew how to teach a center-quarterback exchange because all we
had ever coached was single wing." And they were loath to give up the di-
abolical blocking schemes so effective in the single wing and afraid to let
go of the intricate backfield play fakes. They needed some sort of hybrid.
They stayed up late every night, tinkering with plays, trying to marry
single wing blocking and faking principles to an offense with the quarter-
back under center. "It was 3 a.m. on the night before the players reported
for practice before Dave finally made his decision," says Lude. "He just
all of sudden said, 'To heck with it; let's just go with
it. He took all our
blocking rules from the unbalanced single wing and converted them to a
balanced line." It was a mix of the single wing and T formations, but it
was the first step in bridging the dominant offense of the first half of the
20th century—Pop Warner's single wing—with what would become one
of the most important offenses of the ensuing 30 years.
It would eventually be called the wing T, because—simply enough—it
looked like the T formation with a single wing wingback, and it appeared
to have elements of both offenses. There was a quarterback under center
and a balanced line (T formation), and here were two backs in the back-
field and a wing flanked to the strong side of the formation (single wing).
The name was intuitive and practical.
Nelson's Maine Black Bears went 5-1-1 with their crude, improvised
wing T. In 1952 Nelson became the head coach at the University of Dela-
ware and again took Lude with him. It was there that the wing T really
29

took flight. Nelson coached the Blue Hens for 15 years and won more than
66% of his games. Three years into his tenure at Delaware he hired Har-
old (Tubby) Raymond as an assistant, and it was Raymond who became
the true curator of the wing T. A former single wing quarterback and
linebacker under Crisler at Michigan, Raymond—this can get confusing-
joined the Maine staff under Westerman in 1951 when Nelson and Lude
went to Delaware. The two staffs, Nelson's and Lude's at Delaware and
Westerman's and Raymond's at Maine, wore out clipboards refining the
wing T from its rough beginnings the previous year.
"We took what Nelson started at Maine and worked with it," says Ray-
mond. "The biggest differences between the wing T and everything that
came before it was that the offensive skill requirements were shared more
equally. You didn't need a Jack Armstrong at quarterback to do every-
thing. You had a balanced line, so the positions were symmetrical, instead
of asymmetrical. Now you could threaten several points of attack on the
line of scrimmage on every snap."
Twelve years after arriving at Delaware, Tubby Raymond took over as head
coach, a position he held for 36 years and 300 victories. His teams won three
national titles and 14 Lambert Cups, emblematic of Eastern small-college
supremacy. Raymond's success was sweeping and his offense so ingrained in
his program that the wing T became known as the Delaware Wing T.
The wing T was one of the first offensive systems built on the idea of
forcing the defense to make decisions in response to what it expects the
offense to run and then having the offense attack with something slightly
different. Raymond once told a coaching convention, "It is designed to
create defensive player reacts [sic] to stop a particular play, placing him-
self in jeopardy for a related play."
It was Raymond's staff at Delaware that evolved the wing T into a
truly modern offense, spreading the field, adding straight drop-back pass-
ing and, eventually, an option game. In a 1998 interview Raymond said,
"Prior to 1966, all of the formations [in the wing T] were tight [similar
to the single wing]
Our passing game was made up exclusively of
play-action passes. We didn't have any three-step or five-step drops. [But]
when we started in 1966, we incorporated the wideout and the various
drops
Our [other] contribution [was] running the triple option from
a wing formation, as opposed to the wishbone formation."

THE WING T
The success of the wing T was not limited to Delaware and Maine.
Even as Nelson and Raymond developed the offense, others followed and
sought their advice. It became part of historic programs at the highest
levels of the game. The first of those programs was Iowa, which adopted
the wing T under Evashevski and won the Rose Bowl following the 1956
season. Next came LSU.
Paul Dietzel had played on the line at Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, in the late 1940s on a post-World War II team that included future
coaching giants Bill Arnsparger, Ara Parseghian and Bo Schembechler.
He worked under Red Blaik at Army and Paul (Bear) Bryant at Kentucky
before being named head coach at LSU in 1955. The Bayou Bengals hadn't
won a Southeastern Conference tide since winning back-to-back SEC—
and national—championships in 1935 and '36. And the Dietzel Era did
not start with promise: LSU went 11-17-2 in Dietzel's
first three years,
running principally the T formation.
There was no groundswell of anticipation for the 1958 season. "Uni-
versity authorities expected no surge in fan interest. They ordered 30,000
tickets per game for a stadium that seated 67,510," according to a 2008
article in the Baton Rouge Advocate recalling that era. "There were a little
more than 9,000 season-ticket holders. The LSU student body numbered
less than 10,000."
Dietzel, however, saw promise: Junior running backs Billy Cannon
(who would go on to win the Heisman Trophy in 1959), Johnny Robinson
and junior quarterback Warren Rabb were all talented. "Splendid players,"
says Dietzel. "I knew that Davey Nelson and Mike Lude were running the
wing T up north, and when I had a chance to see it, I thought, That's a
nice-looking offense. The deception is good. With the T formation, the
defense always knows where the ball is going. I also liked that the wing T
always had a double team on the line of scrimmage at the point of attack
and usually a lead blocker. It was physical. It was a tough offense."
Dietzel brought Lude to Baton Rouge in the spring and asked him to
teach the offense to his staff. "They showed us the blocking and the ball
handling, everything," says Dietzel. "But then the real payoff was that
Cannon, Rabb and Robinson
all were working summer jobs in Baton
Rouge that summer. They got fascinated with the wing T. They worked
on the ball handling every day, and when fall practice started, they actu-
31

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
ally taught the offense to the rest of the team. When the season started, it
didn't look like we were running an offense that we'd never used before."
The Tigers opened the season with a 26-6 victory at Rice and then, in
Bear Bryant's first season at Alabama, beat the Crimson Tide in Mobile
13-3. After the game Dietzel recalled that Bryant was asked if the wing T
helped Cannon. "Coach Bryant said, T don't know about that, but I'll tell
you one thing: Billy Cannon sure helped the wing 1?
I guess that would
be true too."
LSU won the national tide in '58, going 11-0. DietzePs Tigers won an-
other SEC title in 1961 and another the year after that, when Dietzel had
gone to Army to replace Blaik and Charlie McClendon had taken over in
Baton Rouge. "The wing T was good for us " says Dietzel. "The best thing
was the toughness. The second-best thing was the misdirection. And
it
was not without passing. You run, run, run, and your receivers get lost out
there. We had a play where we would fake to the halfback on a cross buck
and then dump it off to the fullback in the flat, and I'll tell you, that was
one of the best plays we ever ran."
This was all in keeping with the flexibility of the offense. As the passing
game developed through the 1970s, the wing T evolved with it. Raymond
says, "When I came to Delaware in 1954, if you ran into a quarterback who
could beat you with the pass once every other year, that was really some-
thing. But
I always maintained, 'There
is no defense for a well-thrown
ball that's caught.' We had some great passers at Delaware—Jeff Komlo,
Scott Brunner, Rich Gannon. And when we had those great passers, we
used them in the offense accordingly."
Of course, not every team that turned to the wing T immediately won
a national championship or a major bowl. In the same spring that Lude
visited Baton Rouge, he also went to Fayetteville, Ark., where 33-year-old
Frank Broyles had just been hired as head coach. Broyles installed the
wing T and ran it in the season opener, a 12-0 loss to Baylor. The follow-
ing week Broyles scrapped the wing T and never ran it again. "There was
no problem with Davey Nelson's offense," Broyles recalled recently. "We
had a very inexperienced team, and we just didn't have the backs to prop-
erly run the offense. We didn't have Billy Cannon."
In the spring of 1973 Raymond got a call from Ara Parseghian, who
was looking to retool his Notre Dame offense. The Irish had gone 8-3 in
32

THE WING T
the '72 season, which may not sound disastrous, but it was the first time in
nine years that a Parseghian-coached Irish team had lost three games in
a season. Two of those came at the end of the season with a 45-23 loss at
USC and a 40-6 thrashing by Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. Parseghian
was looking for a change.
"He flew me into South Bend, and we met up in a room at the airport,"
recalls Raymond. "I showed him the offense and then we talked every
week afterwards, sometimes a couple times a week." Notre Dame went
11-0 in 1973 and won the national championship. The title was iced when
Notre Dame quarterback Tom Clements faked a cross-buck handoff on
third down from his own two-yard line and completed a 35-yard pass to
tight end Robin Weber, giving the Irish a first down and allowing them to
run out the clock against Alabama.
Parseghian invited Raymond back to South Bend in the spring of 1974
to watch film and evaluate Notre Dame's use of the wing T throughout the
previous season. Raymond had always put great stock in the sequencing
of plays, using certain formations and plays to set up others. He felt that
Notre Dame, despite its success, had been too random in its use of the of-
fense. "Your quarterback doesn't understand play- calling," Raymond told
Parseghian as they sat in a darkened film room.
Parseghian recoiled. "I call the plays!" he shouted.
Thirty-four years later, in the winter of 2008, seven years after his re-
tirement, Tubby Raymond, at age 81, was invited to speak at a national
wing T clinic in Pittsburgh. More than 700 coaches—most of them from
high schools and small colleges—attended, enthralled listening to the
original master of a still-vibrant attack.

WILDCAT SPEED SWEEP
It is the simplest ofplays but ruthlessly efficient. From an unbalanced
line to the right, the "quarterback " usually a single wing tailback-type
player (like Ronnie Brown ofthe 2009 Dolphins), takes a shotgun snap.
Theflanker (on those Dolphins, usually Ricky Williams) runs hard
across theformation in front ofthe QB. The QB can eitherfake the ball
to theflanker or, in the speed sweep, give it to him; theflanker then runs
behind the blocking ofthe heavy side oftheformation, in this case the
right. Theplay, ofcourse, can be run exactly the same way to the left.
