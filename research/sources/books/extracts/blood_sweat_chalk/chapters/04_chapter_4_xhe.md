WISHBONE
A good of Texas coach had a crazy idea, his boss said O.K.,
and the damn thing tore through football like a tornado
South Bend to play Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish were three seasons re-
moved from their last serious national title run, but they still represented
a formidable program, stocked with prized recruits. Notre Dame was 4-1,
having lost only to a powerful Ohio State team. Air Force was 3-2, hav-
ing been beaten in September at Wyoming and by Navy on the weekend
before flying in to face Notre Dame. The Falcons were overmatched and,
remarkably, were still using a piece of college football memorabilia that
was seemingly the province of only the stubborn and the desperate.
College football fans of a certain age would recognize the formation and
its basic plays: A quarterback under center with three running backs be-
hind him in a Y shape, a fake (or handoff) to the fullback and then a classic
keep-or-pitch option to the outside. It was a part of history. At its birth in
1968 Texas sprung the wishbone on an unsuspecting Southwest Confer-
ence and tore through 30 consecutive victories. The Longhorns' formation
begat Oklahoma's wildfire 'bone that ripped up the sport for a decade and
a half and spawned hundreds of imitators at all levels of the game. "That
offense, it changed the game of football for 20 years," says Bill Bradley, a
South Bend, Ind.

HEY CAME bearing a relic.
On a splendid college foot-

fall weekend the Air
Force Academy arrived in
45

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
veteran NFL assistant coach who also happened to be the first wishbone
quarterback in history while a senior at Texas.
The wishbone had even carried into the NFL. In 1981 Archie Manning
was in his 11th year as quarterback with the New Orleans Saints. Bum Phil-
lips was in his first season as the team's head coach, and he thought it might
be useful to install an option play, recalling Manning as a scrambling folk
hero from Ole Miss. In the third game of the season the Saints played the
Giants in New Jersey, and Phillips called the option. Manning was ever the
good soldier but, at age 32, he'd been battered by years of pounding on poor
teams and long ago had been robbed of his quickness. He wobbled down
the line of scrimmage with the ball and at the corner found himself face-
to-face with Giants rookie linebacker Lawrence Taylor, a 22-year-old, 6' 3",
237-pound force of nature. Taylor exploded into Manning and deposited
him on the concrete-hard artificial turf. "I knew I was done right there," said
Manning. "And that was the last time we ran the option with the Saints."
Yet it was instructive that they tried. At the college level Texas (1969),
Oklahoma ('74 and '75) and Alabama ('78 and '79) won national titles with
the pure wishbone not long after its inception. Oklahoma (again, in '85),
Notre Dame ('88) and Colorado ('90) did likewise with offenses based
largely on triple-option principles. Yet by that day in South Bend in '96
it had become almost invisible on Saturday afternoons. Nebraska alone
among major powers swam upstream against the trend, winning national
titles in '94, '95 and '97 with an I formation-based option game. The wish-
bone was used almost exclusively by the service academies and dismissed
by many as a crutch for the undermanned.
Reasons for the wishbone's decline were unclear. "I think it's one word:
recruiting," says Lou Holtz, who ran option football at five stops in his col-
lege coaching career, including with his Notre Dame national champion
in 1988. "Once alumni started treating recruiting like it was a season in
itself, it became very difficult to run the option. All of a sudden, [if you were
an option team,] you couldn't get the dominant quarterback, because you
weren't going to throw the football and get him ready for the NFL. You
couldn't get the dominant left tackle, because you weren't going to teach
him to pass-block. You couldn't get the dominant running back, because he
wasn't going to be featured enough. Now, you can still win with the option
even ifyou don't get those people, but if you're not getting those top recruits,
46

THE WISHBONE
the alumni start to think you're losing and you're not exciting enough."
It was within this atmosphere, though, that the 1996 Air Force team and
its 13th-year head coach, Fisher DeBerry, remained scrupulously committed
to wishbone and flexbone hybrids. A year earlier in Colorado Springs, Notre
Dame had pounded Air Force 44-14, racing to an early lead and shutting
down the 'bone with a physical front. In '96 the Irish were physical again.
Air Force was led by senior quarterback Beau Morgan, a rugged Texan
who would leave the academy as the first college quarterback in history
to pass and run for 1,000 yards in each of two consecutive seasons. But
Morgan had serious doubts about this game. In midweek, after watching
film of the Fighting Irish, he called his father, Barry, who had coached him
at Trinity Christian Academy in Texas. "These guys are so good up front,"
Beau told his dad, "I don't know if we'll gain a yard."
As
it turned out, they gained lots of yards—304 on the ground and
355 overall. Morgan rushed for 183 yards on 23 carries, repeatedly attack-
ing the middle of the Notre Dame defense with a wishbone variation called
the midline option, in which Morgan often carried behind a blocking back
nearly straight up the middle of Notre Dame's defense. They did
it with
a makeshift offensive line—sophomore Zach Jordan, a 240-pound guard,
replaced injured Shawn Tellers after just three plays, and sophomore tackle
Frank Mindrup started the game for the injured Chuck Parks. Most of all,
they did it with superb wishbone execution, leaving Notre Dame in befud-
dled frustration. It was a classic predicament: Notre Dame, with superior
talent, faced a seldom-seen offense with just a week to prepare. The Irish
knew it too. Before the game, according to a story published in USA Today
three days later, Notre Dame defensive coordinator Bob Davie, who would
become head coach the following season, said he'd told Holtz before the
game, "Coach, I am just amazed that more people in college football don't
run the wishbone." Davie added, "I was always afraid to say that publicly
because I'm a defensive coach. I don't want more guys going to it. It really is
an amazing offense." (As for Holtz, his appreciation of the offense has never
wavered. "If I was hired again somewhere," Holtz says, "and they told me
they wanted to win the national championship, I would immediately put in
the option. The dumbest thing I ever did in my career was get away from it.
To this day, it is an offense that cannot be defended")
The game's critical call came with just over seven minutes to play, when
47

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Air Force faced fourth-and-one at the Notre Dame 26-yard line, trailing 17-10.
The Falcons ran their basic triple option, Right 35—"It took me two seconds
to call the play," says Morgan—and Notre Dame attacked Morgan on the cor-
ner with two tacklers, trying to force a rushed decision and an errant pitch
or fumble. Typical of good wishbone teams, however, Air Force had spent
15 minutes every day on a drill called Ride and Decide, in which scout-team
players would attack Morgan even more aggressively than the Irish defend-
ers did, making him pitch with urgency under heavy pressure. "What Notre
Dame did to me," Morgan said, "I had seen every day for three years."
Morgan kicked the ball outside in the instant the pressure reached him,
sending halfback Tobin Ruff to the outside—and all the way into the end
zone for the tying score. Air Force won with a field goal in overtime. In the
locker room after the game, Notre Dame freshman free safety Deke Cooper
put words to the helplessness felt by so many teams beaten by wishbone
football. "I was just confused," said Cooper. "I didn't know what was going
on. In practice I was picking it up. But on the field it was totally different."
Today Beau Morgan understands even better what took place on that after-
noon and many others like it. "Notre Dame was a step behind all day," he says.
"They had a defense that was very skilled, very tough, very fast, but they were
unable to play the way they played against Ohio State or some other team with
similar talent, because against us, they didn't know who had the ball."
Austin, Texas
Summer 1968
THESE WERE restless times for Longhorns football. A decade earlier coach
Darrell Royal, a native Oklahoman who once played postwar defensive back
and quarterback for Bud Wilkinson's powerhouse Sooners, had crossed the
Red River to restore Texas to its burnt-orange glory. He took over in 1957
and had it rolling by '59, when the Horns went 9-2. They lost only eight
games, with two ties, in a six-season stretch that included a national title in
the 1963 season, when they beat Roger Staubach and Navy in the Cotton
Bowl. But by '68 those days seemed long distant and memories had grown
short. Texas had lost four games in each of three consecutive seasons, fall-
ing twice each to Arkansas, SMU and TCU. After closing the '67 season
with consecutive losses to TCU and rival Texas A&M, Royal turned down a
48

THE WISHBONE
bid to the Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston, the same bowl the Longhorns had
played in to end their previous season. It seemed that Royal was downright
embarrassed to go back a second time to a consolation bowl.
Changes would ensue. Royal reworked his staff, most significantly placing
the Longhorns' inert offense (just 186 points in 10 games in '67) in the hands
of 40-year-old linebackers coach Emory Bellard.
It was a curious choice—
Bellard had been in college football for all of one year after coaching 17 years
of high school football at three different stops in Texas. On Dec. 17, 1966, Bel-
lard's team from San Angelo Central High in West Texas had beaten Spring
Branch High of Houston 21-14 for the Texas State Class 4A championship at
Memorial Stadium in Austin. That victory had come on Bellard's 39th birth-
day, and soon thereafter Royal summoned him to the state university. "Every
year since 1954 1 had opportunities to go to at least one school in the South-
west Conference," says Bellard. "But
I loved the high school atmosphere.
Then Darrell called, and of course, that's the only place I would have gone."
Bellard was disappointed in what he found. "We had a really poor football
team," he says. "We went 6-4 that season, nothing like what I would have ex-
pected from the University of Texas." He was on the road south of Abilene in
central Texas recruiting a linebacker that spring when Royal called to inform
him that Bellard would now be calling plays in the autumn. Lord help me,
thought Bellard. But he knew the freshman squad—first-year players were
ineligible for varsity in those days—was strong, led by fullback Steve (Woo)
Worster and wide receiver Charles (Cotton) Speyrer. As the spring unfolded,
Bellard began installing a basic split-T formation offense, which had first
been used by Don Faurot at Missouri in the 1940s and included rudimentary
option plays. He had a different idea in his head, but that he took home with
him, letting it rattle around his brain, imagining what it could do, as the Texas
spring turned to summer, the temperature rising and the pressure building.
Forty years later Emory Bellard, 80 years old, stands on the back patio of
his ranch home in Georgetown, Texas, a half hour north ofAustin. The house
abuts a golf course, and just off the porch is the tee box for the 3rd hole, a long
dogleg right. Bellard doesn't play much golf anymore, but slim and vibrant in
a green sweater and khaki pants, he looks like he could tee it up just fine.
He holds the wishbone close to his soul. In a sense
it was the perfect
marriage of man and method, an offense for the overmatched created by a
small-sized man working in a big man's game.
49

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
Like almost all football coaches, Bellard paid his dues toiling for years at
the lowest levels of the game. Born in Luling, Texas, south of Austin, Bellard
was raised in the small South Texas town of Port Aransas but didn't play
football in high school until he was a junior, a single wing tailback at Aransas
Pass High. (He was also on the track team and claims he once did 63 chin-ups
in one minute while competing in a now extinct state championship event
called the rural pentathlon.) He enlisted in the Army shortly after graduat-
ing in the spring of 1945, but the war ended soon after, and Bellard headed
off to the University of Texas, a 5' 9", 165-pound scatback joining the biggest
nationwide influx of college football players in the history of the game. He
played on the freshman team in the fall of '45 and broke his leg. "Went from
10-flat in the hundred to 11-flat," he says. He never won a letter in Austin and
finished up at Southwest Texas State Teachers College. He became a coach in
the fall of '50 at Alice High, west of Corpus Christi, where he worked under
former Detroit Lions offensive lineman Ox Emerson, who taught him the
basics of scouting and strategy. He would spend 16 more seasons coaching at
three more Texas high schools and win three prized state titles.
It was during Bellard's last year at Ingleside High in 1954 that he began
to experiment with the roots of what would become the wishbone. "We
had a good athlete playing quarterback that year and another good one
coming up," says Bellard. "They could both do a lot of things. There were
some things I thought we might be able to do with the quarterback and the
fullback." Option football was not new; when Royal played at Oklahoma,
the Sooners ran a straight down-the-line option with no fake to a fullback.
Other teams had done likewise, sending the quarterback to the corner of
the line with the "option" to keep the ball or pitch it out, based on the reac-
tion of the contain player on the edge. But Bellard started thinking of ways
to incorporate the fullback, for a third option. (In keeping with the overlap-
ping nature of the history of football innovation, Barry Switzer would later
suggest that Bellard may have picked up some of his ideas from Charles
(Spud) Cason, a junior high school coach in Fort Worth in the '50s, who is
said to have experimented with similar schemes.)
Between 1955 and his arrival at Texas in '67, Bellard was endlessly sketch-
ing possibilities for his new offense. He was clearly influenced by Bill Yeoman,
the University of Houston head coach; it was Yeoman who truly introduced
the triple option to college football, in the form of his split back
tcveer" offense
50

THE WISHBONE
in 1965. Yeoman was a Midwesterner who had played for coach Red Blaik at
Armyjust after World War II and got his first head coachingjob at Houston in
'62. After starting out a promising 7-4 in his first season, Yeoman's Cougars
slipped to 2-8 in '63 and were 2-4-1 in November of '64, preparing to play
Perm State at home, when they happened onto the triple option by accident.
"We were getting ready for Penn State, Coach" recalls Yeoman—he calls
his interviewer "Coach" throughout a long conversation. "And I wanted to
run an old power sweep into a short slot. For some reason, I don't remember
why, we had the two halfbacks lined up behind the guards on each side. Well,
we ran a dive inside there, and the defensive tackle came way upheld and we
cut it up inside him. The next morning we looked at the film and I said, 'Hold
on a minute, let's look at that.' And we put it in against Penn State, and even
though we got beat, Coach, we ran for a whole bunch of yards."
In the spring Yeoman installed the veer, so-named because the front-side
halfback "veers" slightly to the outside while the quarterback puts the ball in
the halfback's belly and either gives it to him (option 1) or keeps it, depending
on the movement ofthe defensive tackle. After that initial read, the quarterback
would either run upfield (option 2) or pitch it to the trailing halfback (option 3)
from the back side of the formation. Early in the '65 season Yeoman got cold
feet and didn't often run his new triple-option veer, and the Cougars started
out 1-5. Before a Halloween weekend game against Tennessee-Chattanooga
("Good thing it was Tennessee-Chattanooga," he says), Yeoman told his team,
"We're going to run this thing the way we ran it in the spring."
The Cougars went 3-0-1 in their last four games and went 47-15-2 over
the next six seasons, half a step ahead of America in running the triple op-
tion. "We weren't going to be able to muscle anybody out," remembers Yeo-
man. "But with the veer, at least for a few years, nobody knew what we were
doing, so they couldn't stop us." It helped that from 1965 to '67 Yeoman had
a brilliant halfback named Warren McVea and in '67 and '68 a smart, slip-
pery quarterback named Paul Gipson.
Bellard was watching Houston's success and kept tinkering with his
own version. He conceived three building blocks, some of which mirrored
Yeoman's offense, and some of which did not:
1) Formation Instead of two running backs behind the quarterback, there
would be three. They would line up in a fashion similar to a straight-T full
house (which was not new), except that the fullback—the middle of the
51

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
three running backs—would be moved forward. Conceptually, this would
allow the first option (the fullback dive) to hit more quickly, speeding up
the entire offense and forcing quick decisions from the defense. Visually, it
would look like a letter Y.
2) Reads The triple option, right or left, was the basis from which all wishbone
plays would develop. Its first movement, again, had the quarterback putting
the ball in the belly of the fullback and reading the defensive tackle, who was
not being btocked; instead, he was allowed to come free. If he attacked the
fullback, the quarterback pulled the ball out of the fullback's belly and con-
tinued on down the line for the second and third options. If the tackle ignored
the fullback, driving straight upheld to impede the quarterback's movement
down the line, the quarterback gave the ball to the fullback. If the quarter-
back kept the ball, he would sprint down the line of scrimmage until he en-
countered an outside defender, usually a defensive end or outside linebacker,
but occasionally a strong safety. If that defender attacked the quarterback, the
QB would flip—pitch—the ball outside to a trailing halfback. "If you're doing
it right, there are two defenders on the line of scrimmage who you don't even
have to block," says Fisher DeBerry, who ran the option for 23 seasons at Air
Force. "You're just reading them both with the quarterback."
3) Blocking Not only was Bellard proposing to read two blocks on the of-
fensive front (Yeoman's veer read only the outside defender), but he was
also using the front-side halfback (the one closest to the corner) as a lead
blocker. While the quarterback worked down the line of scrimmage, the
trailing halfback accelerated into open space to receive the pitch (ideally
slashing upheld just as the quarterback flipped the ball to him). The lead
halfback would barrel forward, blocking any defender in the gaps.
THERE WERE other wrinkles in the offense that Bellard had in mind, and
other coaches would later add many more. "It all came down to one-two-
three," he says. "One, somebody has to take the quarterback on the outside.
Two, somebody has to take the pitch man. Three, somebody has to cover
the deep third or you can beat 'em with the vertical passing game. And we
did that." As summer arrived in '68, Bellard still wasn't ready to bring his
offense to Royal. In the backyard of his Austin home he lined up his sons-
Emory, Jr. was 18, and Bob was just eight—and one of their friends in his
new formation. Bellard played quarterback himself. Just to see it with live
52

THE WISHBONE
bodies. And it looked like it worked. He went over to the Texas campus and
rounded up some football players who had exhausted their eligibility, and
he again played quarterback while they ran the other positions. Again, it
looked viable. "One thing I knew," says Bellard. "If I could run
it, I knew
durn sure I could teach good athletes to run it."
Still, he kept his baby under wraps. Royal was under intense heat from
spoiled Texas alums; for Bellard to suggest a virgin offense, virtually un-
tested, was a mighty risk. Bellard found a former UT quarterback named
Andy White, who had been with the Longhorns in '66, and asked him to
run the formation with Bellard's band of postgrads. Again,
it seemed to
click, and at last Bellard felt ready to take it to the head coach. He went to
Royal's office in Gregory Gym, Bellard smoking his ever-present pipe, and
drew the new scheme up on a chalkboard. Then he walked Royal down to
the field in Memorial Stadium, where White and his ersatz teammates were
waiting to demonstrate. Royal watched impassively at first and then began
to coach. After little more than an hour of repetition, he turned to Bellard
and said, "Let's go with it."
To this day Bellard is humbled by the thought of that. "People hardly re-
member how tough those times were," he says. "Darrell had gone 6-4, 7-4,
6-4, and here I am suggesting something way out of the mold. But he looked
at it, and he understood it, and he put his stamp on it. That took a lot of guts."
They would need the right quarterback to run
it. At the start of two-a-
day practices in the summer of 1968, Bill Bradley was the Texas Longhorns
quarterback. Bradley had been dubbed Super Bill for his high school ex-
ploits; he was a Texas schoolboy legend in a state that worships at the altar
of Friday-night football and exalts its young heroes more fervently than
most. His reputation took root in the fall of '64. As a senior quarterback at
Palestine High ("God's country!" a wisecracking Bradley would hoot more
than four decades later. "The Holy Land!"), Bradley led his team to the Tex-
as Class 3A state title. He was a righthanded quarterback who sometimes
threw with his left. He punted too, and Texas teammates would recall that,
just for fun, he would occasionally launch a high hanger during practice
and then sprint down the field and catch it, cackling all the way. At Texas
he had presided over the last two of Royal's four-loss seasons, but it never
occurred to anyone that the mediocrity was the fault of Super Bill.
As the starter for the '68 season, Bradley would operate the new offense,
53

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
which did not yet have a name. The halfbacks would be senior Chris Gilbert and
junior Ted Koy (whose father, Ernie Sr., had been a Longhorns star in the early
1930s and whose older brother, Ernie Jr., was in the NFL with the New York Gi-
ants). Steve Worster, the heralded sophomore, was installed as the all-important
fullback The pieces were in place. And they almost instantly crumbled.
Texas was tied by Houston 20-20 in the season opener at Memorial
Stadium. But Bellard's offense did get its name that night when Royal met
with a group of sportswriters at the Villa Capri Hotel in Austin. According
to historian Bill Little, one of the reporters asked Royal what he should call
this new offense, albeit such an unsuccessful one in the opener. Said the
writer, "It looks like a Y."
From near the door Mickey Herskowitz of the Houston Post said, "It
looks like a pulley-bone." That sounded about right to Royal, who said,
"O.K. The wishbone."
It appeared the name might die a quick and quiet death. A week later
in Lubbock, Texas Tech beat the Longhorns 31-22, a loss that would knock
Texas from the national rankings. Bradley was struggling with Bellard's of-
fense. "One of the greatest athletes I've ever seen," recalls Bellard. "But he
was Super Bill, and he had created so many things in his mind that he just
had to do, and he was trying to do it all. And nobody can do it all."
In the spring of 2008 Bradley was employed as the defensive backfield
coach for the San Diego Chargers, as full of piss and vinegar as he had been
as a teenager in Austin, and he remembered the start of the '68 season as if
it had just happened. "Here's what you're lookin' at," says Bradley. "You've
got a team that went 6-4, 7-4 and 6-4. Now we're 0-1-1 in 1968, and we're
all flyin' on two twin-engine planes out of Lubbock in the middle of the
night back to Austin. We've got an embryo offense and a quarterback who
can't operate it properly. Got that? So we land at, I don't know, two or three
in the morning, and then there's a knock on my door at 5:30 a.m. Sunday.
I'm dead asleep. Voice on the other side of the door says, 'Bill, Coach Royal
wants to see you in his office.' Well, you know what Coach Royal used to
say: 'When you pass the ball, three things can happen, and two of them are
bad'? Well, when you get called into his office at 5:30 on Sunday morning
and you're the quarterback and you're 0-1-1, there's about five things that
can happen, and all of 'em are bad."
Bradley dragged himself over to the same Gregory Gym office where
54

THE WISHBONE
Bellard had sold Royal on the new offense two months earlier. Royal, a
dominant and intimidating figure in the game and in the state, fixed his
eyes on Super Bill and said, "Bill, we're fixin' to make some changes, and
I'm startin' with you."
Says Bradley, "I'm 20 years old. And I am devastated." Royal shuffled
four or five other positions that day, but none, of course, was more impor-
tant than quarterback. Super Bill would be replaced by his backup, James
Street, a 5' 11", 170-pound junior out of Longview, Texas. Everybody called
him Rat, short for River Rat, because on a team canoeing trip he had tipped
over and helplessly fought the cold water, terrified and panicking because
he didn't swim well. He wasn't half the athlete that Bradley was. "But he
was a competin' jackass," says Bellard. "He was wound up like a nine-day
clock." Street had finished the Texas Tech loss and injected some life into
the Texas offense in garbage time. There had been a little spark, and that
was enough of a catalyst for the change.
Four decades later James Street is a wealthy man, running The James
Street Group out of an office building in Austin. His company specializes in
structured settlements, arranging long-term disbursements to claimants in
personal injury and wrongful death cases. He is the father of five boys; the
oldest, Huston, is a major league pitcher, now the Colorado Rockies closer
and one of the game's best relievers. James
still walks and talks with the
jaunty confidence of a little man with something to prove. In 1968, he was
close friends with Bradley when he replaced him, and they remain close
friends to this day. Surely their friendship was cemented during the first
practice after the change.
"Monday after the Texas Tech game, we come out onto the field for practice,
and I'm nervous as hell," says Street. "Bradley comes out and lines up with the
split ends, because he's not a quarterback anymore. Everybody is kind of tight
because we're 0-1-1 and we've got a new quarterback. So Bradley lines up to
run a pattern and he unties his pants, so as soon as he starts running, his pants
fall down around his ankles. And that just broke the ice for everybody.
"Then we get to the next game, and we're playing Oklahoma State at
home," says Street. "Before the game Bradley stands up. He's the captain.
He tells everybody to be quiet and he says, 'All right, the Rat's gonna lead
us to victory today. We all gotta support the Rat.' He threw his full support
behind me that day, and it was big, because he was still Super Bill. What
55

Blood, Sweat and Chalk
he did that week, and every week after that, allowed me to do everything I
did." One more schematic change helped: Bellard and Royal moved Wor-
ster back one step, still in front of the halfbacks but not quite so close to the
line of scrimmage. It gave both Street and Worster a split second longer to
read the dive option, while keeping pressure on the defense.
All Street did was win every game he started, 20 in a row, from a 31-3
rout of Oklahoma State in that first week all the way through a 21-17 win
over Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl on New Year's Day in 1970. During
that stretch Texas averaged nearly 39 points a game and opponents floun-
dered trying to decipher the option attack. Street's decision-making was
flawless. Worster attacked the first option with abandon, often turning the
quick-hitting fullback dive into a long gain. Koy and Gilbert were perpetu-
ally loose on the corner, and just as Bellard had predicted, confusion and
missed assignments often left wide receiver Cotton Speyrer open deep. In
a 47-26 rout of Baylor in '68, Gilbert (212 yards), Worster (137) and Street
(108) all cracked the 100-yard mark. On New Year's Day 1969 in the Cot-
ton Bowl, the Longhorns trampled Tennessee 36-13 and finished the year
ranked No. 3 in the nation. And the next season would be even better.
After sputtering in a 17-0 season-opening win over California in Berke-
ley, Texas tore through eight consecutive opponents by an average margin
of nearly 37 points a game. Sophomore halfback Jim Bertelsen had seam-
lessly filled Gilbert's spot, and Street, Koy and Worster seemed to get slicker
with every game. On a raw afternoon in December in Fayetteville, Ark., the
No. 1-ranked Longhorns beat No. 2 Arkansas in the second so-called "Game
of the Century" in modern college football history. (The first had been three
years earlier, when No. 1 Notre Dame and No. 2 Michigan State had played
to a 10-10 tie.) The Texas-Arkansas matchup turned on a single play that is
central to the history of the sport and to the lore of the wishbone.
Trailing 14-8, Texas faced fourth-and-three on
its own 43-yard line.
Royal called Street to the sideline and shouted into the ear hole of his white
helmet: "53 Veer Pass." Street paused and looked at Royal. The coach re-
peated, more loudly, "53 Veer Pass" and sent Street back onto the field. It
was a fairly standard wishbone play that included a fullback ride to the
tight end (strong) side. Except on this play Street pulled the ball from Wor-
steds belly, dropped back five yards and threw deep up the seam to tight
end Randy Peschel, the only receiver in the pattern. The ball was thrown
56

THE WISHBONE
with perfect touch, and Peschel made a beautiful catch on a ball that came
directly over the top of his helmet in tight coverage. It was a 44-yard gain.
Two plays later Bertelsen scored the tying touchdown and Happy Feller
kicked the winning extra point. Even before Texas wrapped up its first na-
tional title since 1963, Street was a legend.
"You know what I'm known for, more than anything else in my life?"
says Street. "Fourth down and three, I could get it done. And I've lived my
whole life that way."
The ensuing spring was a once-in-a-lifetime whirlwind for Street. He met
John Wayne. He hung out with Elvis Presley. He turned down a chance to visit
former president Lyndon Johnson at his ranch because, says Street, "Shoot,
that sounded boring." Publications of the day kept referring to Street's side-
burns, as if his facial hair underscored his cool. "How lucky I had to be that
I was in the right place at the right time," Street says. "They changed the of-
fense, and it was new and it fit my style. And I take no credit. Hell, the first
time Emory showed it to me and Bradley in training camp, we said to each
other, 'What in the hell are they doing?' But it just took off, and for the rest of
my life I'm quote-unquote James Street and people treat me differently." (For
his part, Bill Bradley eventually moved from wide receiver to defensive back,
started the last few games of his senior year at Texas and played nine years in
the NFL, eight of them for the Philadelphia Eagles. Super Bill, indeed.)
It was at a 1990 reunion of the '69 Longhorns that Street connected with
billionaire Houston attorneyJoseph Jamail, an ardent supporter of their alma
mater. As Street tells it, Jamail said, "Street, I'm fixin' to buy some life insur-
ance;
I'll buy it from you." Soon thereafter, JamaiPs tax attorney introduced
Street to the world of structured settlements. Says Street, "I got lucky."
On the football field the Longhorns' wishbone didn't slow in Street's
absence. Eddie Phillips stepped in at quarterback, and Texas went 10-0 in
the 1970 regular season before losing a rematch with Notre Dame in the
Cotton Bowl on New Year's Day 1971. But by then the wishbone was already
sweeping through the sport like a Texas windstorm, being copied franti-
cally throughout the game.

I-BONE MIDLINE OPTION
The Nebraska Cornhuskers ofthe mid- andlate '90s used the midline option with
huge success behindquarterbacks Tommie Frazier, Scott Frost andEric Crouch
They ran it out ofa wishbone variation calledthe I-bone, in which thefullback
and tailback arepositionedin a straight line (T) directly behindthe quarterback.
As in the wishbone, the quarterback 'rides " thefullback into the middle and,
reading the reaction ofthe defensive tackle, decides whether to give the ball to
thefullback orpull it back. Ifhe keeps it, insteadofrunning along the line of
scrimmage andmaking the keep-orpitch readwith the tailback, the quarterback
follows thefullback (2) into the inside hole behindblocks by thefullback and the
play-sideguard. The speedy Nebraska quarterbacks often reachedthe secondlevel
ofthe defense before the linebackers hadeven readthe initialfake.
