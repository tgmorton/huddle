Can We Do Better?

T
he 2018 draft class has proven to be an ideal laboratory for studying quarterbacks: who rises to the top of the draft, who has performed on the field, who is falling short, where the experts appeared to be right—and wrong. Most important, it has given us some insights to understand why. Everything is happening the way it always does. That is to say, we’re being surprised. The top pick of the first round is a question mark. The last pick of the first round is the MVP. The guys in the middle are… in the middle. Except for one who may be heading for the door.

So, what, if anything, can we learn about who, when, and why to make our picks in the future? How do we get better at evaluating young quarterbacks 
before
 they get to the NFL, so that once they get there, they deliver? How do we spend our money and our opportunities more wisely? One thing we know is how much we don’t know. Despite the reams of data available, despite all the analytics we can analyze, despite the years of experience/eyeballing/
instinct of pro scouts, despite their collective gut feel, radar, and clairvoyance, despite the best breakdowns by outside pundits and gurus, despite the Todd McShays and Mel Kipers, despite the ex-players and ex-coaches (like me), despite fantasy football and Vegas odds, we’re still not as good at predicting success as we could be. And we should be. How do we use the tools we have more effectively? How do we see past our blind spots? How do we separate the good information from the bad? What can we learn from our misses and our occasional hits? How do we project instead of just hope? 
How do we get better?

The tools/information/clues are there… if we use them better. Even a little better, even 2 or 3 or 5 percent, can translate to a little more success, and a little more success may mean one more touchdown or one more win, which could put a team in the wild card round, and that could lead to the divisional playoffs, and that could mean the Super Bowl. That’s how important a little better is. If, instead of picking quarterbacks at 50-50, it was 51-49 or 55-45, it would have profound impact on the game, lots of games, maybe even the biggest game. Think of it off the football field. (There’s a whole world out there that isn’t playing football.) If the board of directors of a public company is able to find and pick a slightly better CEO, one who has even a fraction more foresight, a tiny bit better grasp of the opposition, faster reaction time when under pressure, the ability to scramble when the competition closes in, that can make all the difference in the fate of the company. It can be the difference between a dividend or a loss at year end. It can mean more investors investing. It can mean knocking off a market leader. That’s what a little better can mean.

If the game is changing, we better change with it

Throw away any single piece of data. Completion percentage? Interesting but not by itself. Average yards per pass? Not by itself. Even interceptions don’t tell enough without context. Context is actual play, actual games, actual footage. Miles of it.

Throw away the “tried and true” methods of picking. They’re tried but not true. The draft won’t make picks for you, with the cream rising to the top. Draft order doesn’t prove anything except that the order is often wrong.

Throw away the school level or style of play. Small-school quarterbacks don’t make it in the NFL… except when they do. West Coast offenses don’t translate to the pros… except when they do. Mobile quarterbacks don’t succeed as much as pocket passers… except when they do.

Throw away the old quarterback guides. Height, school, IQ, “look.” They’re not wrong. They’re not right. They’re largely irrelevant or out of date.

Throw away the height thing. 
Quarterbacks have to be six foot three or more.
 Bull. But that’s a sure way to draft a tall bust. And pass up a shorter Hall of Famer.

Throw away the old intelligence measurements—GPAs, SATs, and, by all means, the Wonderlic test used by NFL teams at the Combine. Most tests have been designed to see how much information—facts, figures, language—we can provide on demand. They have not been designed to measure ability to process information and make decisions; that is, to think. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to figure out if a quarterback is “smart,” but we should first figure out what “smart” is.

And please throw away “he looks like a quarterback.” In baseball, they used to say that about pitchers. “They,” of course, were old, tobacco-chewing AAA road warriors who could just tell when a major league pitcher came along. Except they were wrong a lot. Quarterbacks don’t look a certain way. Okay, they all smile and fist-pump after a touchdown.

If we keep reusing the old bromides, the quarterback clichés, we’re sure to keep picking at a 50-50 rate, at best. This is one case where recycling isn’t the answer.

The Insteads

In place of the throwaways, we have to use more objective, more open-minded, fresher thinking. Some of it is common sense that maybe we ignored. Some of it is new thinking. All of it is based on what we actually see and know, not what we wish for.

Instead of single metrics, only metrics in context

The 2018 draft class and the cumulative wisdom of past classes have taught us that data is valuable, but not in isolation. We have to look at and use the information we have more objectively, more dispassionately, more in combination than in a vacuum. Look at the numbers—completion percentage, yards gained, TDs to INTs—but view them in the context of each other. And the word “view” is key. Really view/review/study them. That means the tape, film, video, digital files—the record, in motion, of what really happened. Data doesn’t play football. A guy does. Data doesn’t 
complete a pass. A guy does. Watch how he does it. Over and over. There is no such thing as watching too much tape. The tape alone will show you a great play. Or a lousy one. But the tape plus the numbers will tell you more. The numbers will tell you how often he does something. The tape will tell you 
how
 he does it.

As explained earlier, the only good data is data we can project from; that is, trends/patterns/directions, not instances. And the best data is data in combination with other data. Completion percentage is more telling when measured under pressure, like when the QB is being blitzed. And still better when it becomes a pattern, year after year. How did he do from his first to his second season to his third? But that data is best when compared to the tapes showing the reality of a game. Lots and lots of game tapes. How is his footwork when he’s being chased? What does his release look like? Does he see the open man when the first read falls apart? Tape, tape, and more tape. Film, film, and more film. Video truth. Don’t stop watching until you see a trend. If it’s a good trend, keep this guy in the running. If it’s not, scratch him. In spite of any single number that may look good.

Really? Do the old vets believe in that too? We asked Gary Kubiak, whose quarterback credentials are a mile long, “Gary, how do you evaluate prospective quarterbacks?” He gave us a two-word answer: “Watching film.” That’s it? Yup. Not just watching, but watching to compare to the data. He says, “I was old school until fifteen years ago,” but he’s become “a big believer in analytics” and says now you have to “grow with it, lean on it, listen to it.” His litmus test is “watching film” to see if the analytics show up on it.

Instead of the tried and true, find the real truth

Instead of hoping the draft will find talent for us, we have to find it ourselves. A lot of old pros believe the draft process itself pushes the best talent to the top, and the job of a team is just to maneuver and trade draft picks to climb up the ladder and increase your chances of getting that best guy. The draft process is the cumulative information of each prospect’s college career—where he played, his stats—plus the evaluation at the Combine, plus the views of scouts, plus the draft wizards in the media, plus the relative needs of each team. All that information and momentum and popular wisdom ought to push the best talent to the top. Does it happen that way? Does reality follow “ought to”? We took a hard look at the results.

Two decades, over 200 quarterbacks.
 In the last twenty years, over 268 quarterbacks have been taken in the NFL draft. How did we do? No shock: no better than 50-50. The real questions will be why, when, and what can we do to improve that? I looked at the picks as (1) successful, (2) moderately successful—backups, (3) still too early to tell, and (4) busts. I only put the “bust” label on first-rounders, since later picks carry lower expectations. Admittedly my evaluation is subjective, but so is most of the selection process, at least until recently.

1998: This was the Peyton Manning draft, but also the Ryan Leaf draft, the definition of 50-50. The next group fell into the moderately successful bucket—Charlie Batch (number 60), Brian Griese (number 91), and Matt Hasselbeck (number 187)—backups and sometimes starters, largely “system” QBs or game managers, hardly a compliment.

1999: This was a colossal bust year, with the first and third picks—Tim Couch and Akili Smith—sandwiching Donovan McNabb at number two, the only one who had a solid career. Then came the eleven and twelve picks of Daunte Culpepper to the Vikings and Cade McNown to the Bears. Culpepper had a moderately successful career surrounded by Hall of Famers in Randy Moss and Chris Carter. McNown didn’t.

2000: The busts of 1999 led to a QB-fear year. The only first-rounder was Chad Pennington at eighteen, the ultimate system QB who had an average arm and athletic ability but good field intelligence. Let’s not forget that this was also the year Tom Brady was missed by almost everyone and not taken until number 199.

2001: Like the previous year, there was only one QB taken in the first round: Michael Vick, number one overall. Drew Brees was technically a second-round pick, but it was with the number thirty-two overall pick since a team had forfeited a first-round draft choice. Two out of two is a good year for quarterback picks.

2002: Quarterback caution should have continued, but due to team “need,” the dangerous motivator, it did not. Three QBs were taken in the first round. David Carr was the first overall pick, and Joey Harrington was the third. Neither lived up to their draft position. Patrick Ramsey was the last pick of the first round, taken by Steve Spurrier and the Redskins. Probably the best quarterback in this draft was the eighty-first pick: Josh McCown, the classic system QB, lasted sixteen years in the NFL with nine different teams.

2003: If need was a factor the year before, it was a demand in ’03. Carson Palmer was the first overall pick and had a solid career with the Bengals and Cardinals. Byron Leftwich was number seven and went to Jacksonville, while Kyle Boller went at nineteen to the Ravens (yes, me), and Rex Grossman was taken at twenty-two by the Bears, all less-than-average careers. At best, a 25-75 year.

2004: Maybe it was the law of averages: After a bad year, this one was pretty good. Eli Manning was the number one overall pick to the Chargers, and Philip Rivers went at number four to the Giants (then they swapped when Manning said he wouldn’t go to San Diego). Both have gone on to potential Hall of Fame careers. Ben Roethlisberger was picked at eleven by the Steelers and also has had a Hall of Fame career. J. P. Losman went at twenty-two to Buffalo but had only one year as a starter. That flipped the outcome to 75-25.

2005: This was a solid follow-up year with Alex Smith number one overall to San Francisco and future Hall of Famer Aaron Rodgers at number twenty-four. Next was number twenty-five, Jason Campbell, with a nine-year, five-team backup career. Ryan Fitzpatrick of Harvard was the last QB taken in the draft, in the seventh round at number 250, and “Fitzmagic” has had a fifteen-year career with eight different teams.

2006: Big bust year, period. Vince Young went at number three and Matt Leinart at number ten, both disappointments. Jay Cutler was probably the most successful pick, at number eleven, but he had a checkered career at best.

2007: An even bigger bust. JaMarcus Russell was the number one overall (and maybe the number one overall bust in the NFL ever), and Brady Quinn at twenty-two went to the Browns to continue their bad luck at drafting QBs.

2008: After two bad years, this one was solid, maybe solid-plus. Matt Ryan went at number three to the Falcons, while Joe Flacco was taken at eighteen by the Ravens. Ryan has been a very good starter his entire career, and Flacco was a solid player with flashes of brilliance and a Super Bowl ring and MVP.

2009: Another less-than-sterling year, with a one-out-of-three hit ratio. Matthew Stafford, number one overall, has had a good career with the Lions (but not a great supporting cast). Mark Sanchez, the number five pick, took the Jets to the AFC Championship game, but from then on has been a letdown. And Josh Freeman disappointed big time at number seventeen with Tampa Bay.

2010: The bust streak goes on. Sam Bradford was number one overall, showed signs of potential, but couldn’t stay healthy. Tim Tebow was the twenty-fifth pick, but was a case study in the importance of skill emphasis in the NFL. A good-throwing quarterback who also has some athletic abilities brings an added asset, but an athlete-first who has some ability to throw has a limited future in the pro game.

2011: This was one of the more interesting QB draft classes. Cam Newton went at number one, despite some worry he was a risk, having only started one year at Auburn. But his one year was an incredible 
year: He won the Heisman Trophy over Andrew Luck by throwing for 30 TDs to 7 INTs and having a 66 percent completion rate. After Newton, there was a stampede for QBs, from Jake Locker at number eight to Blaine Gabbert at ten to Christian Ponder at twelve. All were thought to be second-rounders, but need took over and they got scooped up early, way too early. All ultimately failed in the NFL. But two players taken early in the second round, Andy Dalton and Colin Kaepernick, had okay-to-good careers, Dalton as longtime starter with the Bengals, and Kaepernick leading the 49ers to a Super Bowl (before having a rough aftermath and endless controversy).

2012: This year looked like a gold mine, with four quarterbacks taken in the first round. At number one, Andrew Luck was as close to being a sure thing as we’d seen. Right behind him was Robert Griffin III (RG3). Luck lived up to his promise and his name, while RG3 had a spectacular rookie year followed by a near career-ending injury. Ryan Tannehill went at number eight to the Dolphins and had an up-and-down career, probably bust-worthy, until 2019, when he was traded to the Titans, came in at game six, and racked up a spectacular 70 percent completion, 22 TD to 6 INT performance, and took them to the playoffs. By the way, he replaced first-round bust Marcus Mariota. And if ’12 was supposed to be a gold mine, let’s not forget the nugget that most teams missed—Russell Wilson, taken in the third round at number seventy-five. He outperformed all five taken ahead of him. The clues were there but were ignored. Failure to extrapolate.

2013: This was a long-overdue gun-shy year, but not gun-shy enough. After years of first-round overreaches, this year saw only 
one quarterback taken. E. J. Manuel went to Buffalo at number sixteen, and his career never materialized as a starter.

2014: An oops year. Oops, three QBs were drafted in the first round but none should have been. Blake Bortles went at number three to Jacksonville; the Browns wasted their number twenty-two on Johnny Manziel (“Johnny Football”—really?); Teddy Bridgewater went as the last pick of the round to the Vikings. Teddy’s career had a late upturn when he filled in for the injured Drew Brees at the Saints, winning seven games in 2019. Two of the better picks this year came in the second round with Derek Carr (great stats, not enough wins in Oakland) and Jimmy Garoppolo (Brady understudy who took San Francisco to the Super Bowl in 2019).

2015: A cautious but unsuccessful year. Only two quarterbacks were taken but they were number one and number two, Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota, and both range from so-so to near busts.

2016: Some could argue that 2016 fates are still “too early to tell,” but they’re sure inching toward “we better know soon.” Jared Goff, the number one overall pick, led the Rams to the Super Bowl in 2018 and landed a mega-contract, but he and/or his team fell flat in 2019. Carson Wentz at number two has had solid starts, but injuries are haunting him, causing questions on his durability and overall production. Paxton Lynch went at number twenty-six to Denver, and it’s probably not too early to tell he’s been a bust. One of the late-draft surprises has been Dak Prescott, a fourth-rounder, who went to the Cowboys, replaced Tony Romo as the starter, took the team to the playoffs, became a Pro Bowler, and has gotten a franchise tag from Dallas.

2017: This draft is worthy of scrutiny, not because of 
who
 was drafted but because of 
when
 they were drafted, the order and the outcomes. The number two overall pick was Mitchell Trubisky to the Bears, and he is still trying to prove he was worthy of the high selection. But further back in the pack, Patrick Mahomes at number ten and Deshaun Watson at number twelve are both at the forefront of the style of quarterback play that may be revolutionizing the game. It seems that even when we get it right—picking the right guys—we still get it a little bit wrong, picking them in the wrong order.

2018: This year, the year we are examining under the microscope, has been one of the largest-ever first-round quarterback draft classes—five guys. To say the least, these quarterbacks and the order in which they were drafted are worthy of study, analysis, second-guessing, and will provide some understanding for the future.

2019: After the boom of ’18, we had three very strong candidates this year. Kyler Murray was number one to the Cardinals (after they discarded last year’s number ten, Josh Rosen), Daniel Jones was number six to the Giants, and Dwayne Haskins was number fifteen to the Redskins. All are unknowns so far, but all are starters for their teams.

Observations

Some teams pick badly.
 In the last twenty years, the two teams that have taken the most first- and second-round quarterbacks are the Browns and the Jets, six each. While the jury is out on their picks 
from 2018, the jury has been unanimous in finding both teams guilty of poor picks in the past. And keep in mind, that’s with changing coaches, changing GMs, even changing ownership. Is there such a thing as a curse? Logic says no. Data says maybe.

Players who drop to number five to ten have an explanation for not doing so well.
 They fell below the very top. But… Patrick Mahomes and Daniel Jones may prove to be exceptions.

Picks from number ten to twenty seem to have a better shot at success.
 Maybe we miss them. Maybe some smart GMs see what we missed. Culpepper, Roethlisberger, Cutler, Pennington, and Flacco all did well. (By the way, they also all went to smaller schools. More on that below.)

Selections from twenty to thirty-two have been lethal… usually.
 They seem to belong in the second round but rise because teams reach out of desperation. And sometimes there are hidden gems there, guys who might have been snagged in the second round that you can steal late in the first. Maybe there’s a Lamar Jackson being overlooked. Eric DeCosta, Ravens GM, told me about how they went to great lengths to keep their interest in Lamar secret to avoid competition from New Orleans or New England. That’s why Ozzie Newsome traded up to the last spot in the first round, to stay ahead of the other suitors. That’s finding the right guy at the right time and getting the right value, or bonus value.

Order of talent doesn’t follow order of pick.
 The number one draft pick of the 2018 class, Baker Mayfield, has shown promise but is 
struggling. In contrast, the last pick of the first round, Lamar Jackson, set the league on fire. The three QBs in the middle are (a) Sam Darnold—fate unknown, (b) Josh Allen—some good signs, and (c) Josh Rosen—almost out of the game. Mathematically, the upshot is about a 50 percent rate of picking success—think Ryan Leaf vs. Peyton Manning—which is consistent with what we’ve seen through the years. But the order of those results is hardly what we would have expected. While top QB picks like Deshaun Watson, Andrew Luck, and Cam Newton largely lived up to their hype, plenty haven’t. David Carr (poster boy for draft busts), Sam Bradford, Jameis Winston, Blake Bortles, Tim Couch, Joey Harrington, and Akili Smith were all high picks and highly disappointing. At the other end of the spectrum, in addition to the perennial example of Tom Brady as “the guy we missed,” there’s Drew Brees at number thirty-two (same spot as Lamar Jackson), Russell Wilson at seventy-five, Joe Montana at eighty-two, and Kurt Warner, undrafted free agent and Hall of Famer. We’ve had plenty of upside-down results. And that will continue until we get better at this.

Instead of 
where
 
a kid played, look at
 
how
 he played

Aren’t there some college programs that turn out more pro quarterbacks than others? For sure. Purdue has had sixteen, but the stars have been few and far between—Len Dawson (1957), then Bob Griese ( ’67) and Drew Brees (2001). USC counts eight, but only one who has made it big, Carson Palmer. LSU gave the NFL seven, but exactly none who have been stars (unless you count Y. A. Tittle, drafted in 1948, playing in the ’50s). Oregon, six—other than Dan Fouts, no standouts. Michigan, six—one superstar, Tom Brady. What about Alabama, no doubt the best college football team in 
modern times? They’ve won seventeen national championships, five in just the last few years. And when they haven’t won, they’ve been close. The joke is that Nick Saban, the Crimson Tide coach, can’t afford to take a pay cut to become an NFL coach. So they must turn out great quarterbacks, right? Not really. Other than Bart Starr from the fifties and Joe Namath from the early sixties, and maybe Ken Stabler, not too many have been successful in the NFL. Alabama has sent lots of future stars to the pros, but in positions other than quarterback. However, 2020 may be a turning point with two ’Bama QBs on the board, Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts, who transferred to Oklahoma. And at least an NFL team or two are going to bet their futures on a “Roll Tide” quarterback, so we’ll see.

So schools and levels of competition haven’t been exactly a treasure map to quarterbacks. Even the size of the program hasn’t been particularly indicative. Little Boston College has churned out three NFL QBs—Doug Flutie, Matt Hasselback, and Matt Ryan. Carson Wentz came out of North Dakota State. Eastern Illinois gave us Tony Romo and Jimmy Garoppolo. And three-time Super Bowler Ben Roethlisberger came out of Miami of Ohio, playing against opponents like Buffalo, Akron, Ball State, Bowling Green, and Kent State.

Instead of style of offense, conference, height, weight, or hometown, look for performance. Period.

If the obvious clues were reliable, like conference or level—SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, ACC, Mountain West, big school, small school—or style of play—wide open, run and gun, pocket, shotgun, pistol, pro style, West Coast—or where he grew up—small town, big city, Sunbelt, rust belt—or what he looked like—stocky, lanky, angular, boxy, 
tall, taller—or his grades or his economics or his ethnicity—if any of those, or all of them combined, could tell us who’s going to make it and who isn’t, we wouldn’t be scratching our heads every year asking, “What the hell just happened?” The clues aren’t clues. They’re a collection of legends, easy answers to hard questions. And easy answers are most often wrong. Here’s a guy who is six foot five, rugged good looks, raised by hardworking middle-class parents, grew up in Montana, multisport jock, played football every Friday night in high school, swamped with full-ride offers, went to Washington State, Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year, took his team to the Rose Bowl, has an arm like a rocket launcher, and is impossible to knock down in the pocket. No wonder that guy was taken number two in the first round. If he isn’t a model for an NFL quarterback, who is? Okay, now how about a guy who’s barely six feet tall; didn’t play tackle football until he was in high school; son of an affluent trial lawyer; got injured in high school; received only two college offers and took the one with the best academics, not the best sports program; had a good college career but didn’t get drafted until the second round. Not exactly the prototype NFL quarterback, right? Well, the first guy, the surefire guy, is Ryan Leaf. The second guy is Drew Brees. Not to pick on Ryan Leaf, because he had plenty of personal challenges, but only to say that the obvious clues may be obvious but they’re hardly a guarantee of anything. Same goes for Drew Brees in reverse.

Instead of GPAs, SATs, and Wonderlics, look for AIQ

If a quarterback is the leader on the football field, how do we determine who has the intelligence, judgment, reason, vision, and guts to lead? It’s the same problem businesses face when they look for 
executives and ultimately CEOs. Do they recruit only from Ivy League schools, the hardest colleges to get into? Or do they hunt for hungry, driven young people trying to prove their worth? Is it discipline or imagination? Or both? And how do you measure the “it”?

The scuttlebutt in football is that some coaches don’t want a player who is “too smart” because he’ll be hard to coach. Of course, that’s a bunch of bull. I’ve coached plenty of high-IQ guys who were extremely coachable, smart enough to know what they don’t know. And plenty of not-so-bright lights who couldn’t be taught to turn a light on. And everything in between. There are even coaches who don’t want a kid with too high a Wonderlic test score. Personally, I prefer a guy without a Wonderlic score, since it doesn’t tell us much of anything. Nor does an SAT or, in most cases, even a GPA. SATs depend on accumulating facts and knowledge and being able to spit them out on demand—no minor skill but not indicative of whether a guy can process information in 2.5 seconds. GPAs are dependent on even more variables, from level of classes to level of school, to class size, to whether the teachers gave easy grades to jocks or the reverse. A 4.0 is not a 4.0 everywhere or all the time. The Wonderlic test was created in 1936 to gauge cognitive ability, specifically in mathematics, language or vocabulary, and reasoning. It has been used by the NFL since the 1960s. With only fifty multiple-choice questions, so it could be given and scored quickly, right at the Combine, it seemed like a good idea at the time. We didn’t have anything else. And now they give out the test to all NFL teams for free. It’s good PR for them. But as far as I can tell, there is only one number that comes out of the Wonderlic that is reliable. Zero. There is zero correlation between Wonderlic scores and NFL success. So, what’s better?

Interview the kid and ask better questions. Ask hypotheticals—some about football, some about life. “If you see a dime defense 
and the play is supposed to drop the ball into their coverage, do you dump it off to a running back, roll out and look for a breaking receiver, keep it and run, move around until the coverage changes, or throw the ball away?” And ask him to answer very fast. “When you’re being blitzed from the left, do you look right? 
Answer fast.
” “On a quarterback keep, what if the hole left of center closes? 
Answer fast.
” “When you meet a girl you want to go out with, do you ask her right away in a crowd or wait until no one else is around?… If it’s raining, do you wear a hat?… Do you ever run yellow lights?” It’s not just what his answer is, it’s how fast he gives it and whether it makes sense. It doesn’t have to be what you would do. Let’s say you never run yellow lights. Maybe you want your quarterback to be gutsy enough to do it. But not red lights. Also look for dumb answers. Cocky, full-of-himself answers. Confident yes, cocky no.

Ask other people. Teammates, roommates, friends, parents, coaches, teachers, next-door neighbors. Look for people who know him away from football. Sure, most will tell you the good stuff, but if you listen closely, people tend to tell the truth. 
He’s a smart kid but not as smart as he thinks he is… He’s quiet but don’t let that fool you.

It’s much harder work for you to do the detective work than to look at a test score, but it may tell you more. You have to know if he’s smart enough to lead. You’re not looking for all the facts he can regurgitate. He’ll learn the facts of plays, formations, packages, schemes on your team, from your coaches. Not the date the Magna Carta was signed (with all due respect to the year 1215 and the beginnings of constitutional democracy). You’re looking to see if he can process and think with the information on the chalkboard, in his playbook, on the practice field, and on the football field. Is there a way to measure that ability? It looks like maybe yes.

There’s an emerging field of intelligence evaluation that shows a lot of promise—athletic intelligence. (Although it’s called “athletic,” it’s equally applicable to first responders, firefighters, EMTs, military officers, pilots, even entrepreneurs, any endeavor that requires evaluations of “smart” by pragmatic and situational gauges.) There are several variations, but essentially, evaluation is based on something called the Cattell-Horn-Carroll test, one of the dominant assessments of intelligence. A basic tenet of the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory is that “intelligence is a stable genetic trait.” That means, if you have intelligence, you have it. It 
doesn’t
 mean the usual tests always find it. If we get better at finding it, we will find better minds to perform better, to think and act more effectively. So say Scott Goldman, PhD, and Jim Bowman, PsyD, co-founders of Athletic Intelligence Measures, which administers the AIQ (Athletic Intelligence Quotient). Here’s how Scott explains the need for a better test. “People use ‘intelligence’ and ‘knowledge’ interchangeably when they’re not. Intelligence is the ability to acquire, process, and apply information. If you have a puzzle and you don’t already know the answer, then you use intelligence to problem-solve it. When you already possess the answer, that is knowledge, or experience.” So the AIQ doesn’t test what you know. Rather, it measures how you solve for what you don’t know as well as how you acquire new information. For example, the AIQ measures visual-spatial processing and decision-making; that is, what someone sees, how he/she processes it to come to a solution, as well as learning efficiency, which indicates how many “reps” are needed to absorb the information, and how well a person can recall it later when needed. It’s like playing against a shot clock in basketball, or a play clock on the football field, or what happens in the next seconds after the snap.

One of the keys to Goldman and his team’s success is that their 
test is not delivered on paper or in a written form. The tests are done on an iPad, with instructions given visually and verbally, in the native language of the test-taker (baseball teams are taking the tests to Latin American countries, using the Spanish versions developed to align with local dialects), and instructions are repeated as necessary without penalty. The questions are in the form of gamelike exercises, not unlike Tetris. They are not language- or culture-dependent. But they are timed because, like a sports activity, there is temporal pressure to find a solution. You must process fast and correctly, not one or the other. Goldman says one of the most common responses from athletes after taking the test is, “Damn, that was hard… and fun.”

Is it credible and predictive? Clients seem to think so. The company has a database of six thousand elite athletes across all five major leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and MLS) as well as Olympians, Power Five conference schools, special forces in the military, and e-sport gamers. In the NFL, they have been collecting data since 2012 and have over two thousand players in their database. For 2020, they are under contract with eight teams, and tested over four hundred players at the East-West, Senior Bowls, and the Combine. And remember, unlike the Wonderlic, this test is not free, so they have to believe in it to pay for it.

Does it work in football? Goldman says, “Yes, it accurately measures what it is intended to measure.” But, does it predict? He adds, “Well, nothing really predicts in sports. If you could predict game outcomes, you should go to Vegas.” Goldman is too much of a scientist to promise outcomes, but as a scientist, he offers data. They have found “statistically significant” correlations between the AIQ and outcomes such as rushing yards, sacks, interceptions, and “weighted career approximate value” (Pro Football Reference’s Approximate Value stat—seasonal value, per player).

Does it work specifically for quarterbacks? So far, they’ve tested over a hundred quarterbacks or quarterback prospects. Goldman offers one example that he can share (carefully worded out of respect for his non-disclosure agreements with his clients). The AIQ found eleven quarterbacks with superior scores on a “narrow ability.” Examples of narrow abilities are: spatial awareness—knowing where the end zone is when you’re in motion or turned around, and being able to recalibrate; reaction time after distraction—a blitz or change in coverage; adjustment to stimulus—defensive shifts; learning efficiency—how quickly the athlete absorbs and comprehends new input. Six of the eleven QBs demonstrated scores on reaction time after distraction, a narrow ability which, when coupled with other key factors, is believed to be indicative of QB mobility: Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, Daniel Jones, Teddy Bridgewater, and Ryan Tannehill. The other five who showed superior scores on this ability (perhaps lacking other needed factors) are no longer in the game. That, by the way, is a 54 percent success rate, well above our 50-50. And the more he tests, the more he learns.

By way of anecdotal examples, someone leaked Baker Mayfield’s AIQ to 
Sports Illustrated
 as one of the top-scoring quarterbacks of his class or of any class. And Lamar Jackson showed clearly superior scores in several elements of the AIQ, displaying, in Goldman’s words, “the cognitive abilities to be a good QB.”

None of that guarantees anything, but it seems to reveal much more than we’ve known before. As Goldman says, “The test is not a predictor; it’s a descriptor. In other words, it is meant to help teams understand 
how
 the player is successful as well as 
how
 the team can maximize their abilities.”

My conclusion is, it’s early and more tests will tell us more, but 
the AIQ is already a better “descriptor” than most we’ve seen. The real lesson is, it’s not the same; it’s change.

A subset of “smart”—character and leadership

There is no test for character other than life itself. But one company that also utilizes the AIQ, Premier Sport Psychology, does give a behavioral profile test called DISC (they got it from Athletes Assessment out of Australia) that seems to show correlations between real-life behavior and performance. Premier currently consults with teams in the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, USA National Teams, and a university athletic department within the Big Ten Conference.

DISC is a behavioral assessment that looks at/for four traits: dominance, influence, steadiness, and compliance. Just by the names of the traits, you can see that if the DISC test works, it could really give us a preview of how a kid may perform. Dominance can be a clue to natural leadership… or power madness. Influence can tell us if that young person’s words and actions sway others… or turn them off. Steadiness can reveal cool under fire… or panic. Compliance may be the key to getting along or causing revolt when it comes to crunch time. Justin Anderson, PsyD and founder of Premier, himself a quarterback at the University of Minnesota Duluth and three-sport high school athlete, explains it this way: “DISC looks for a behavioral profile. Like being right- or left-handed, there’s no right or wrong way.” But he says it helps to know which way a person is wired. Can you really alter or modify someone? Yes, like when you break an arm and learn to use the other arm. But when under stress, people often return to the baseline, their original arm. DISC looks for these traits, but underlying 
the traits are motivators, what drives people. Some people want to be the best, period. Others are after money or security. Some are looking for a good relationship. If you know the motivator, you can connect with the athlete better and maybe elicit better performance. If you don’t, you rely on what would motivate you, not him.

Has DISC worked in looking at quarterbacks? Anderson says yes, cautiously. He has given the test formally at Pro Days in the NBA and on top-30 visits in the NFL (when teams ask certain players to come to their facilities). But he has also employed it informally, not giving the full test but relying on his own experience to sit in the interview room at the Combine while GMs or coaches talk to a prospect. During the interviews, Anderson observes the clues to see if a kid would show a strong trait, which may tell us how the person will deal with problems. For instance, a high D (dominance) might be indicated by a strong handshake, looking right in your eyes, or sitting assertively. A high I (influence) would be seen in a more extroverted, emotive type, maybe quick-witted. Low I would show as more reserved, less personable, even speaking in lower tones of voice. S (steadiness) gives a picture of how a person deals with pace—particularly changes in pace, stress, or attack—and whether the person has patience and persistence and prefers not to shift gears. And C (compliance) indicates how a person deals with rules, detail, accuracy, and data. Does he rely on facts? Does he aim for high standards?

Prior to the last two drafts, Anderson sat in on several quarterback interviews, even asking his own questions on occasion. The interview lasts fifteen to eighteen minutes, so it’s a reasonable conversation length, long enough to reveal, short enough to maintain interest. Overall, he sees a high-D kid as likely to have command, be strong in the huddle, and have a clear drive toward goals. 
Influence is important too, but he notes it can be expressed differently by different people: strong, quiet types or strong, expressive types. Anderson says it’s good to see a level of S, or steadiness, but not have it be the ruling trait for most quarterbacks. Impatience can be good too. Similarly, compliance is good up to a point. Know the rules. But then you may have to break rules to overcome adversity.

The test claims to have another benefit: what you can do with the results. The company maintains they can identify areas for improvement and even provide tools to improve or modify behavior. That last element is a big promise, but if it’s true, we could find ways to lessen or eliminate insecurity or knock down and recalibrate arrogance. Their results to date are modest.

But these are the kinds of tools we need. Especially if we put them together with “going to the film”—that is, looking at the evidence from the past, meticulously, repeatedly. In the case of personality or character, that means digging into the anecdotal past of these star players. Digging deep. College, high school, middle school, summers. Coaches—not just of football but other sports too—teachers, parents, next-door neighbors, ex-girlfriends, summer bosses, anybody who had good, bad, or neutral contact. That means, if possible, not just the people who want to give a good reference, but also those that can offer insights. 
He played on our middle school baseball team and he had a terrible temper… He took piano lessons, and if it hadn’t been for football, I thought he could be a musician… We broke up in the tenth grade but he was nice about it… He got in trouble but always got out of it because he was a hotshot.
 Of course, look for patterns, not just isolated stories. There’s always someone who wants to say something glowing. And someone who wants to be a naysayer. And we must allow for mistakes. Kids do dumb things. (So do adults.) We’re not looking for flawless kids. We’re looking 
for kids who learn from their mistakes, who show patterns of improvement. Kids who really do mature. And there are signs, if we look hard enough. It’s your job to go to the film—the film of life—over and over and over. Every kid we see in the NFL has a past that gives away his present. Sometimes it’s good, sometimes not so good. Lots of times we don’t want to face it because he has an arm like a rocket launcher and can pinpoint a moving target. Personality and character matter. They seem to be opaque; that is, hard to view and assess. But maybe not. Maybe new tools can enable us to get a window into personality and character in advance of the draft and see what they look like and even how to shape them.

Dr. Anderson’s approach, while maybe raw in its development and database, takes a fresh look at personality as a determining factor for a player, particularly for a quarterback. While the AIQ (Goldman and Anderson know and share each other’s work) may “tease out aspects of intelligence,” we need to know how a player uses that intelligence, what his go-to tendencies are. Anderson uses the expression, “Knowledge suffocates the ability to process,” meaning you need to stay present, weed out distractions, not get bogged down in information overload. Personality may well tell us if a player has the tendency or trait to let too much input overwhelm decisions. Anderson points to the contrasting cases of Christian Ponder, a first-rounder who seemed to overprocess and let anxiety rule, and Brett Favre, who could filter and process at lightning speed.

Most critical in the personality equation, says Dr. Anderson, are tendencies and compatibility. He and his test can tell us a lot about a player’s personality and character traits. But are those traits compatible with what the coach or scheme demands? DISC can identify a beautiful, perfect, well-honed round peg. But a coach may have a perfectly 
formed, sharp-edged square hole. Not a fit. On the other hand, when the fit works, it is powerful. Joe Montana and Bill Walsh. Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes. When you put a quarterback in situations where he has a high chance of success or cannot fail, he gains confidence. When you do the opposite, he bleeds confidence. Anxiety and confidence have an inverse relationship. Confidence is the most fragile body part on the football field. Yet NFL teams do little or nothing to train coaches to adjust to the player—instead of the reverse—especially the quarterback, to welcome and utilize change to build confidence.

Which brings us to the issue of fit…

Instead of drafting a quarterback, look for a marriage

A quarterback is only as good as the match with his coach or coaches. There is an age-old debate about who’s the most important person in a football organization: the quarterback, head coach, GM, or owner. We could look around the league and draw our conclusions. Instead, we went back to our Harvard Business School experts/weekend football fans for their take. They actually studied the question. Logic and outcomes tell us that the “who’s most important” controversy quickly comes down to the quarterback and the head coach, though the other two figures, GM and owner, can play important parts. We asked Dr. Groysberg the question directly, “Okay, who is it?” (By the way, on the subject of relative importance, Groysberg declined to acknowledge himself as the lead author of the study, but rather as one on a team of equals.) For the answer on the football field, Groysberg turned to the favorite sports bar argument—Brady or Belichick? The consensus seems to be Brady in that case, but it’s close. The question of who is more important in general is answered by the draft.

The 2020 draft as evidence

As always, the draft was the symbolic kickoff of another season of NFL excitement. But this one was different. It came in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic. That meant no stadium hoopla, no fans in attendance, no players walking onstage and shaking hands with the commissioner. All remote. All distant. All virtual. So was it a downer? Hardly. Broadcast from Roger Goodell’s basement, from team “war rooms,” from players’ homes, surrounded by anxious families, fans starved for sports flocked to their screens—15.6 million watchers, up 37 percent from the previous year! Viewership literally “Zoomed”! As for the outcomes, they reinforced what we knew. In the past twenty-one NFL drafts, the number one, top-of-the-board pick has been a QB fifteen times. With the 2020 draft, that makes sixteen times. The consensus “best player in the draft” was Chase Young, defensive end from Ohio State, but he was picked second, not first. The number one overall pick, and no surprise to anyone, was QB Joe Burrow out of LSU, who went to the Bengals. As predicted, the Dolphins essentially gave up on Josh Rosen by taking Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa at number five. The Chargers followed at number six with Justin Herbert, QB from Oregon. Green Bay, with Aaron Rodgers at QB, hardly had an immediate need but couldn’t resist Jordan Love from Utah State. (Remember past Packers GM Ron Wolf drafting a quarterback in seven of eight drafts while he still had Hall of Famer Brett Favre.) Four quarterbacks in the first round. And QB Jalen Hurts went to the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round, despite the Eagles’ healthy Carson Wentz. The results are flashing in neon: 
Quarterback—Quarterback—Quarterback.

But on the other hand…

The head coach in football, more than any other sport, actually determines the play on the field, whether it’s offense, defense, or even special teams. He’s the play caller. Or at least he’s getting the plays from his coaches and then deciding what play to call, what the quarterback or linebacker hears in his earphones. Nobody has more influence over strategy and tactics, with the possible exception of a military general. As Boris and his team remind us, the trophy for the biggest win in sports, the Super Bowl, is named for a coach, Vince Lombardi, not an owner or GM or even a great player. But hey, what about that GM? He’s on the hot seat to size up players and put the personnel together, trading, signing free agents, and of course, drafting. My longtime GM Ozzie Newsome turned our franchise from a loser to a winner, with two Super Bowls. He found Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Jonathan Ogden, Jamal Lewis, and plenty more. I give him the lion’s share of the credit. Well, maybe I should give the credit to the owner, Art Modell, who put Ozzie in charge, but we’ll look at owners in a minute. Ozzie and his successor, Eric DeCosta, get the credit for drafting Lamar Jackson. That’s a pretty good case for the importance of the role. The same might apply to Ron Wolf at the Packers or John Dorsey in Kansas City and Cleveland, and now Howie Roseman of the Eagles.

But can’t the owners get some love here? After all, they pay for all of this. And they make the initial picks of GM and head coach… and if they’re smart, they don’t try to pick the quarterback. Some teams turn over the reins to the GM, some to the coach, and some try to do it literally as a family. Sometimes that works—like in New Orleans and Kansas City—and sometimes it doesn’t—like in places 
that have family feuds instead of family harmony. Some have just one guy who calls almost all the shots, like Jerry Jones in Dallas. When it works, he’s brilliant, and when it doesn’t, he’s a dictator.

All that is conjecture. What did the researchers find? First, overall “combined leadership”—all four roles working in sync—accounts for most success. But within that, there are some key revelations. Statistically, over a thirty-plus year study of results, of what the authors call the “explained variance” in wins and losses, owners get credit for 11 percent of success, GMs about double that, coaches almost 30 percent, and quarterbacks 37 percent. The quarterback is three times as important to winning as the owner… if you don’t count the fact that the owner signs the QB’s paycheck. Together, the GM and coach add up to over half of the successes. But quarterbacks and coaches together get credit for two-thirds of the success.

And here’s a key finding: Of the explained variance (as opposed to the unexplained variance, which are those factors that cannot be specifically attributed), owners and GMs were more important in the past than today. QBs and head coaches are now the pivotal figures. The quarterback’s contribution has risen; the head coach has stayed about even, dropping slightly; but the GM, already lower than the other two, dropped a fraction, and the owner’s influence dropped a good deal. Why? A more wide-open, offense-driven game—more passing, more run-pass options, and more innovative, on-the-fly plays. A game that demands a great quarterback. The league MVP award now almost automatically goes to a quarterback: 2015—Cam Newton; 2016—Matt Ryan; 2017—Tom Brady; 2018—Patrick Mahomes; 2019—Lamar Jackson; and Peyton Manning five times. So it’s the quarterback. But we still haven’t figured out how to find the right guy. FiveThirtyEight.com, the statistics, polling, and metrics website, wrote: “NFL scouts, coaches 
and general managers—the world’s foremost experts on football player evaluation—have been notoriously terrible at separating good QB prospects from the bad through the years.”

The marriage—arranged or true love?

It takes more than just identifying the guys who appear to be good or potentially great. It takes something else. It takes a match. It takes a coach who wants that guy who’s about to be picked, who wants and will adjust to that style of play that taps the player’s strength, and will not try to jam him into a scheme that ties him in knots. It takes a coach who knows how to talk to and work with a kid, literally a kid, who has enormous talent but needs to hone it and direct it. Some coaches I’ve seen over the years work far better with veterans just because they don’t have to explain as much. With young QBs, we should remember what Kevin Stefanski says, “put your arm around the kid” and be his “father, brother, shrink, and confessor.”

It’s easy to see the matches that have worked and the ones that haven’t. Belichick and Brady, though they may not be best pals off the field, together are at the top of the success ladder, leading to the who’s-most-important debates. But well before the two of them came Joe Montana and Bill Walsh. I was there; I saw it; and it was as remarkable a display of how to nurture a youngster into a leader as I’ve ever seen. Would Montana have done as well for someone else? I doubt it. Would Walsh have done as well with another quarterback? Based on what he did in developing Steve Young, I’d say yes. In recent times, we’ve seen the Hue Jackson–Baker Mayfield mismatch, and Aaron Rodgers and Mike McCarthy’s divorce over irreconcilable differences. On the other hand, Sean Payton and Drew Brees have been in sync from day one. The same can be said of Pete Carroll and Russell 
Wilson. Andy Reid showed he “gets” quarterbacks, especially mobile QBs—Donovan McNabb in Philly, then a late-career Michael Vick, and then in KC, bonding with the most innovative quarterback in football, Patrick Mahomes. Put Mahomes into a Green Bay offense and I venture to say it wouldn’t be nearly as game-changing. As we’ve said, one of the best pivots in football in recent years was John Harbaugh, moving from the very conventional, and largely successful, pocket-passer offense with Joe Flacco to the wide-open—very, very wide-open—you-don’t-know-what-to-expect offense of young Lamar Jackson. And I emphasize young because John, in his late fifties, has been remarkable about bonding with a raw but immensely talented kid. John has done most of the adapting. And that’s why they’re winning. It’s not the quarterback. It’s not the coach. It’s the match. It’s the marriage. And like a marriage, sure, one person earns more money. One person manages the family. But they are not often the same person. So they better be a good match.

We know that college and pro quarterbacks who go through a lot of change in coaches often struggle to find themselves, or their game, or the best schemes. But it’s more than just consistency; it’s the fit between the quarterback—in style of play, in communication, in personality, sometimes even in sense of humor—and the coach. At the risk of repetition because it warrants emphasis, a coach who has tunnel vision for the old pocket-passer offense and tries to jam a mobile QB into that model is likely going to see a guy uncomfortable with his role and a team struggling to make it work. A coach who is not open to another style of play better make sure he and the GM agree to draft a quarterback who fits his style, not just the next guy up who is ranked high. When the GM and coach don’t agree, they get the wrong quarterback for the coach or the wrong coach for the quarterback. And as 
we well know, if/when the team has taken a first-round QB and things go wrong, the coach will be the casualty, not the kid. But in spite of how much sense it makes to have a good match, we—NFL coaches and teams—keep trying to force-fit bad matches.

One interesting observation, or hypothesis, is that maybe, from the been-there-done-that experience, former QBs make good mentors for QBs. And going further, maybe former backup QBs are even better mentors because they faced longer odds. They understand the game from the perspective of the kid carrying the weight of the world, the need to rally and improvise and rise to the occasion to keep the game, your team, and often your career alive. Nobody has to scramble, literally and figuratively, like a backup quarterback. You come into the game as a second choice, and then you’re asked to save the day. Joe Montana had to do it. So did Tom Brady, replacing starter Drew Bledsoe. Brett Favre did it. Steve Young did it after Montana. Aaron Rodgers did it after Favre. Ben Roethlisberger did it. Kurt Warner did it. Jim Plunkett did it back in the 1970s. They all became starters and stars. But it seems it’s the guys who didn’t become stars who may have more empathy, more affinity and comradery with which to connect to young quarterbacks—big brothers, tough love, coaches in every sense.

The backup-as-coach brotherhood may be just a theory, but history gives it some validity. Take Tom Flores, a starter and backup with the Raiders, later head coach of the Raiders and Seahawks, working with quarterbacks Ken Stabler and then Jim Plunkett, who led the Raiders to two Super Bowls.

Frank Reich originally backed up Boomer Esiason at Maryland, then among others, Hall of Famer Jim Kelly in Buffalo and Kerry Collins at the Panthers. Hall of Fame executive Bill Polian, former GM in Buffalo, said Reich was “the greatest backup quarterback in 
NFL history”… sort of a compliment, I think. But Frank has been something of an offensive whiz as a coach with the Colts, Cardinals, Chargers, and Eagles, and head coach of the Colts in 2018, taking them to the postseason.

Sean Payton was a backup to a variety of unknowns in the Arena Football League and the CFL, and was even a strikebreaker in the NFL with the Bears, hardly a distinguished playing career. But he’s considered one of the best offensive and coaching minds in the game as head coach of the Saints since 2006, in perfect harmony with Drew Brees through all of those years.

Jason Garrett was with the Cowboys, behind Troy Aikman on two Super Bowl–winning teams. But after his playing career, he went on to become offensive coordinator and then head coach of the Cowboys from 2011 to 2019, achieving success with quarterbacks Tony Romo and Dak Prescott. In 2020 he became offensive coordinator of the Giants.

Jim Harbaugh played as a starter and backup with several teams, then after a hot run as head coach of Stanford, became head coach of the 49ers and worked with Colin Kaepernick to take the team to the postseason three times and ultimately, the Super Bowl.

Doug Pederson was a classic backup QB who later became an offensive coordinator and then head coach of the Eagles, working with Sam Bradford, drafting and developing Carson Wentz, and creating a near-miracle season when Wentz went down and Nick Foles took over, upsetting the Patriots in the Super Bowl.

Gary Kubiak was an unsung backup to John Elway at the Broncos, but went on to become an offensive coordinator loved by QBs, head coach of the Texans and later the Broncos, taking them to the Super Bowl. He is the ultimate mentor, returning to the game after 
a break to become assistant head coach in Minnesota, and taking Kevin Stefanski under his coaching wing as they both resurrected the career of Kirk Cousins to guide the Vikings to the playoffs, and Kevin to a head coaching job.

That’s a pretty good record for backup quarterbacks as coaches. Especially if you compare it to Hall of Fame quarterbacks turned coaches. Only one, Bart Starr, even got his team to the playoffs, and it was in a season shortened by the strike in 1982. Maybe there is something to this empathy thing. There is definitely something to the idea of the coach and quarterback being on the same page. When it works, the coach and the quarterback essentially form another entity, a third party, a unit stronger than the two components. True synergy. And clearly, when they are not in sync, they are less than the two parties, a negative not only for themselves but for the team.

Alignment—a word for marriage in business and football

“Alignment” is a business term that is very applicable here. Alignment means that a company must have its goals, personnel, and resources all aimed in the same direction. Without alignment, the company cannot achieve its objectives. We see it on the plus and minus side all the time. Southwest Airlines on the plus side; Northwest on the minus. Target and Costco on the plus; JCPenney and Sears on the minus. UPS and Amazon on the plus. Blockbuster was a big plus that became a bigger minus. But in football, to a large extent, we’ve not seen much purposeful alignment. I would conjecture that if we did, we’d get better at picking quarterbacks, and several other positions.

How do you do it? The same way business does. Set out your objectives, your strengths and weaknesses. Of course, objective 
number one is to win, but what is your timeline? One season or within four? What are your strengths? Good defense, running game, receivers? What are your weaknesses? Offensive line, special teams? What is your coach good at? Working with players with years under their belts? Or kids? Or both? Adapting to change, or discipline in a given system? Mentoring or strategizing? Accept reality. If you have a two-year horizon to win, a good defense, and a coach who works well with a traditional scheme and veterans, draft a quarterback who shows he can work in that situation, not one who doesn’t. If you have a coach who can embrace the skills and abilities of a more mobile, maybe less rigid kind of QB, who is willing to rewrite the team playbook, and a GM who can make the personnel changes needed, then go for the other kid. But don’t try to force-fit one into the other. If you do, then expect to fire your coach, and expect an extra year at least of adjustment of quarterback to coach and vice versa.

Any NFL team that is about to draft a quarterback should ask and answer these questions… honestly:

A. What quarterback do you rank highest on your wish list, and what is his style of play? What are his strengths?

B. What style of play does your team use now?

C. Are you willing to embrace major change, including schemes and roster, to maximize the strengths of the new QB?

If A doesn’t match B and you cannot commit to C, don’t draft that guy. If they do match—go for it.
 Without alignment, in business, football, or marriage, you’re headed for trouble—angry stockholders, another losing season, or alimony.

We can do better

The 50-50 rule can be improved, at least a little. And a little can mean a lot. Enough to shake up outcomes. It is not a single metric or practice. It is a composite. That is the Q Factor—the collection of practices that can provide an edge:

Extrapolate.
 Don’t look at any one incident on the football field (or anywhere in life, for that matter). Look for a pattern. Look for a trend. One of anything tells you nothing.

Look at data, but never one metric in a vacuum.
 Don’t be seduced by one big number. Make sure metrics are borne out on film—not highlights, but game after game.

Look for decision-making and leadership.
 They’re not just God-given gifts; they can be demonstrated with evidence… or absence.

Look for intelligence but look to measure it differently.
 Don’t rely on the old tools that measure accumulation of knowledge or facts. Look for evaluations of thinking and processing.

Look at character.
 It matters and it will show later.

Throw out old guidelines—size, economics, ethnicity, school, scheme.
 Look for performance, no matter how, no matter where. Did this guy advance the ball?

Don’t draft out of need.
 It’s the worst evaluator of talent there has ever been. The corollary is, don’t talk yourself into a guy. Need tends to make you do that.

Make sure your QB and coach match.
 If they don’t, one will leave soon, probably the coach.

Accept and embrace change.
 If you don’t adapt, you become extinct. It’s true of dinosaurs and coaches.

Most important: Extrapolate. Don’t imitate.

The mobile quarterback came on big-time in the past few years. So now everybody will be looking at the draft board, saying, “Find me a Patrick Mahomes. Find me a Lamar Jackson.” They might as well say, “Find me a unicorn.” These guys are great quarterbacks. One can run or throw, run a little and then throw, and even throw sidearm. The other guy can run and run and run, and then surprise you with a great throw. But what they do is advance the ball. Somehow. Some way. More times than not. They’re smart. They lead. They find a way.

The next great quarterback is on the board. He may be a mobile QB. Or he may be a pocket passer. Or both. He may be big. Or not so big. He may be from Clemson or Florida, but he may also be from Harvard or Duke. But one thing is sure. The evidence is there, 
if
 we’ll look for it. Once we see evidence, real hard evidence, then we have to make sure it recurs, that we can see it over and over, play it and replay it. If we can see more than an incident—a real trend—then we can project or extrapolate. Then we know something. Then maybe we’ve found someone. Only then. But the question is: Will we look at a hint of evidence and be sucked in too fast, as usual? Will we draft out of need and hope and talk ourselves into what isn’t there? We can do better than 50-50, maybe a good deal better, but it will take brutal honesty and a willingness to dump the old thinking and embrace change—a change of thinking.
