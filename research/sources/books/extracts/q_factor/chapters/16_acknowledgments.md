Acknowledgments

No business is more collaborative than sports. Any coach will tell you he is an amalgam of every coach, player, scout, trainer, owner, or administrator he has ever worked with. I have been extraordinarily lucky to have been associated with many of the great coaching talents in the game, including LaVelle Edwards, Tom Landry, Bill Walsh, Denny Green, and Tony Dungy. The number of assistant coaches that have formed and enhanced my abilities are too numerous to list but include people like Marvin Lewis, Jack Del Rio, Rex Ryan, David Shaw, Mike Smith, Mike Singletary, Mike Pettine, and Mike Nolan, all of whom have gone on to become head coaches. In addition, the likes of Ozzie Newsome, Phil Savage, and Eric DeCosta, among the best ever personnel people, have had a huge impact on my perspective of the game. Of course, the gift of being allowed to work with the countless number of players, which includes twelve Hall of Famers, is what coaching is truly about.

Now, thanks to my friend and colleague Kevin Byrne, I was able to collaborate with co-author Jim Dale, who in turn brought the counsel of agent David Black, who led us to the wisdom of 
editor Sean Desmond. Together with Jim, in 
The Q Factor
, hopefully I have been able to convey a lifetime of learning in the game I love.

Brian Billick

To borrow an overused sports cliché (is that redundant?) 
The Q Factor
 was a team effort, of course, led by a quarterback. Despite years as a coach, Brian Billick was the book’s quarterback, in NFL parlance, an “elite quarterback,” who understands the game, is disarmingly honest about what he knows and doesn’t know, is candid, funny, and openminded, a combination of pretty rare traits in Super Bowl–winning coaches. The rest of the team was comprised of, first Kevin Byrne, communications impresario of the Baltimore Ravens and great people connector who led me to Brian; then David Black, my long-term literary agent (and diehard Jets fan), who not only represented me, Brian, and the property, but also helped shape the concept from its earliest stages; Sean Desmond, our editor at Twelve, who was an incredible partner, encourager, reader/improver (and true football addict); Rachel Kambury from Twelve who was my conscience, reminder, and fixer; contributing experts including Gary Kubiak, Paul DePodesta, Kevin Stefanski, Eric Mangini, Scott Goldman, Justin Anderson, John Verros, Boris Groysberg, Alex Olbrecht, Jeremy Rosen, and Ron Shapiro; my son Andy who went with me to three Super Bowls and schooled me on the game from age eight on; and of course, my life teammate and wife (who knows the difference between a pocket passer and a mobile QB), my MVP on all books and all things, Ellen. Other than those people, I pretty much did it myself.
