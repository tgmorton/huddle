Preface

Spoiler Alert: The Q Factor Works… on the Football Field (And Beyond)

When we set out to write this book, we began a quest to search for, and hopefully find, the elusive, mysterious, mystical formula to improve the success record in drafting NFL quarterbacks—the Q Factor. Historically, drafting a successful quarterback has been a 50-50 outcome at best—half the first-round picks make it and the other half end up backups or busts. Our goal was to better the results by 5 to 10 percent, because that modest increment could be enough to be the difference between winning and losing, making the playoffs, even bringing home the Lombardi Trophy.

Using the QB-rich 2018 draft class as our lab, we developed what we call “extrapolations”—not isolated stats or metrics, but sustained trends of performance that can be tracked over hours and hours (and hours) of game film, and in the film of life, on the field and off—all of which come together to comprise the Q Factor. We summarily discarded the old “tried-and-true” measurements that had been tried but proven not to be true—misguided metrics like arm strength, height, look, even level of play, as well as the craggy old standby, gut feel—another way of saying “guessing.”

The book that follows is an exact account of our real-time assessments and evaluations of the five quarterbacks taken in the first round. Verbatim. As written. As it occurred. Not a word or stat or observation was changed or modified. Despite the temptation, we didn’t give in and rewrite history to make ourselves look better. This was how we saw those QBs then. This was what we predicted, using our extrapolations and applying the Q Factor. And this was what happened in real life, on the field, over the following three seasons.

So how did we do? Candidly, we had skepticism on all five candidates, simply because no quarterback prospect is perfect. They all have flaws; the question is whether those flaws are fatal or surmountable. In their draft order, this is how we saw them:

Positive:
 We said Baker Mayfield had the collection of talents to be a top NFL quarterback. We said he 
might
 have an attitude and arrogance problem and would need a sound, wise coach to develop him into a leader. Mayfield showed promise year one with the Browns. Year two, he got a new coach—a brash wild card who shot from the hip and encouraged Baker to do likewise—and the team and quarterback misfired badly… as did the one-season coach. Year three, Browns brought in a smart sound coach, a solid student of the game, who knew how to nurture talent… and Baker led the Browns to their first playoff game since 1994.

On the fence, leaning negative:
 We said Sam Darnold, who lots of experts had in a virtual tie with Mayfield for the number one pick, had every tool to be a quarterback… but might be lacking the less tangible yet equally critical measure: field command and passion. Sam’s past performance—by the book, within the system, 
predictable but not great under pressure. He didn’t often “save the play,” and that extrapolated into more of the same. Unfortunately, the NFL promised relentless pressure, demand for saving the play, need for field command. And the management of the New York Jets, after years of frustration, was nothing if not impatient. Did Sam have that Q Factor? The short answer is no. Years one, two, and three, all losing records. Now the Jets are quarterback-shopping again.

On the fence, leaning positive:
 We said Josh Allen also had great tools, but in his case, it was also a caution. Josh was reminiscent of Kyle Boller, who checked all the boxes except the box of putting all the tools together. Josh was compared to Ben Roethlisberger—big, strong, rocket arm—to us, a comparison that was wishful thinking. Josh was likened to Carson Wentz, coming from a second-tier college program, and though Allen’s numbers weren’t as good as Carson’s, that comp was the most valid—an underdog who was determined. Josh didn’t get any Division I offers, went to a junior college, then to Wyoming, where he steadily got better, found ways to win games, used his big arm, and, despite his size, could run when he had to. His unabated, undeniable progression was the most telling extrapolation of all—single-minded and unstoppable, the kind of guy you want on the field. Josh was trending the right way but needed time to mature, personally and professionally, and he needed the right coach, which we thought he had from day one in Sean McDermott. We said if the Bills were patient, if Josh continued on his determined, stubborn path, Allen 
could
 evolve into a top QB. Year one he showed flashes of brilliance and flashes of bad field judgment, and Buffalo finished with a losing record. Year 
two, he led his team to a wild card game… and loss. Year three, the patience and determination and grit paid off. With added talent around Josh, he not only took the Bills to the playoffs, they reached the AFC championship.

Negative:
 We said Josh Rosen probably possessed more pure skills and prowess than any quarterback in the draft. But… we had big “buts” with Rosen: Was he a collection of remarkable athletic talents that fed an inflated sense of self-worth? Was he the classic California QB who looked better than he was? Was he coachable or too full of his own hype? Year one he struggled in Phoenix and did not show a lot of positive signs. Year two, the Cardinals got a new coach, a college coach who fell in love with another first-rounder and traded Josh to the Dolphins, where he immediately found himself in a duel with a veteran for the starter’s job. Then the Dolphins bet their future on another first-rounder, couldn’t find a trade for Rosen, and released him. He signed onto the Buccaneers’ practice squad and then with the 49ers, where he saw no action. Three seasons—three and out? We’ll see.

Positive:
 Then there was the final pick of the ’18 first round, Lamar Jackson. We said he could be the biggest surprise of the draft. Conventional wisdom said maybe he was too much of a running quarterback. But conventional wisdom is so often another way of saying “dead wrong.” A deeper dive into the “game film” revealed that from high school through college, his extrapolations—improving completion percentage, passing in pressure situations, remarkable run-pass options results, plus his extraordinary ability to use his legs—were all trending the right way. Jackson was a true dual threat, with his arm and his legs… 
if
 his arm was good enough, 
if
 his legs didn’t put 
him in danger, 
if
 his team and his coach embraced what he was. We said, if anything, Jackson should have gone higher in the draft. But then would he have had as good a coach match as he got? Lamar went to the Ravens, and after veteran Joe Flacco got hurt midseason, head coach John Harbaugh embraced Jackson’s style (totally unlike Flacco’s pocket game) and built his team, on the fly, around his new QB. Jackson went on a 7-1 streak to take the Ravens into the postseason. Year two he led the team to an eye-popping, tour de force, 14-1 season and was the unanimous MVP. Year three, he was out for two games due to COVID, and came back from the locker room, Superman style, in the playoff-deciding game to beat the Browns with a fourth-down TD pass, followed by a march down the field for a game-winning field goal. Three seasons, three postseasons.

Did we find the Q Factor? Did our extrapolations prove out? We were right on two—Mayfield and Jackson—and underestimated one—Allen. The other two—Darnold and Rosen—we thought should not have been taken so early, or at all. So, yes, our extrapolations worked. We picked three and got two of those three right (and even leaned toward positive on the third). And we’d have saved teams a lot of money and mistakes by not drafting the other two. So that’s not 50-50. That’s 66 percent. Not only was it significant in successful picks, but it could have an impact on avoiding unsuccessful picks. We can’t guarantee it will work every year. But it sure should do better than historic outcomes.

If our extrapolations had been applied in 2017, perhaps Patrick Mahomes would have been picked ahead of Mitchell Trubisky. The trends were there. How well did the picks from 2019 do? It looks like Kyler Murray was a Q Factor poster boy. The Cardinals wisely 
ignored the old height caution—is he tall enough to be a QB?—in favor of the undeniable pass-rush totals he racked up from high school and through college, game after game, season after season. Evidently he was tall enough. And 2020? Joe Burrow? Tua Tagovailoa? Justin Herbert? Did the Bengals, Dolphins, or Chargers apply their version of the Q Factor? Other than a yes on Joe Burrow, for the others, it’s too early to tell.

And now with 2021 coming up, could the Q Factor predict who really will be the next top NFL quarterbacks… and who won’t? Will Trevor Lawrence or Justin Fields or Zach Wilson live up to the hype and promise? Could Trey Lance be a wild card? Could Mac Jones rise from the back of the pack? We might suggest, before the Jaguars or the Jets or the Falcons or the Panthers make their picks, they look not only at the usual stats—the tried-and-true—and try something new. We suggest they look at the trends, the projectable extrapolations, the Q Factor. It could be the difference between a starter and a backup, or worse. We do know that without it, it’s 50-50 at best. A coin flip. You don’t want to bet your future on a coin flip.

The same applies to the search for success off the football field, in other fields, any field that demands true field command—business, science, politics, and the military. It turns out the Q Factor is more than a study of elite athletes. It’s a study in leadership qualities, what they are, how to find them, and how not to miss them when they’re in front of us. In business, a better signal caller can be the difference between profit and loss, innovation or struggle, market dominance or demise.

In the book’s new, updated final chapter, we not only deal with the unexpected upheaval of the world, and hence, the 2020 season, 
not only with how the Q Factor predicts the next NFL draft, but how to use our extrapolations to find leaders off the football field. After all, the track record of picking leaders, business and otherwise, has been every bit as hit-or-miss as in the NFL. The Q Factor could change that too.
