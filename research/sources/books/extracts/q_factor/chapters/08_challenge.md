Challenge:

There is no position in sports more important or challenging to fill than quarterback. You can win games without a great one, even the Super Bowl, but it’s hard, very hard. I know; I did it—but not for lack of searching. Winning a championship without that elite QB took the best defense in the modern history of the NFL (almost as hard to find as a quarterback). Ever since then, after leaving the coaching ranks and gaining the clarity of distance, perspective, and analysis, I’ve been determined to see if there’s a better way to evaluate quarterback talent and potential. I set out in search of the Q Factor.

Hypothesis:

Study a small, select group of highly rated, high-draft-pick quarterback prospects—their skills, stats, and character traits—and track their performance and circumstances, and you may uncover patterns of what separates great from merely very good… and maybe reveal methods for spotting and developing future talent—that is, the Q Factor.

Laboratory:

We’re putting the 2018 draft class, the most touted quarterback draft class in a decade, under the microscope—who they are, how 
they got here, who they’re playing for, how well they do and why, and what each is made of: talent, character, metrics, and magic. Studying the ’18 class may reveal the path to better measurement and better prediction, to finding a formula for prognosticating slightly better. And slightly better, just fractionally better, may be enough to make the difference between good and great, between salary-cap dollars spent well instead of burned, to finding a few more leaders and a few fewer busts. For the next class. And the one after. Maybe even a formula that translates into identifying “quarterback-types” in fields beyond the football field.
