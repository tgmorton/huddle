# Offensive Linemen in the Kicking Game

---

Offensive Linemen in the Kicking Game 
An offensive lineman’s responsibility in the kicking game is a relatively 
straightforward role. On kicks for points—such as an extra point and a field goal, the 
offensive lineman’s role is to stop inside penetration. On kick-off returns, the 
lineman’s job is to sprint downfield and execute his blocking assignment, while 
staying under control and blocking above the waist. 
KICK-OFF RETURN 
Many coaches use offensive linemen in the kicking game during the kick-off return 
phase. While this approach is an accepted practice throughout most levels of play, 
some serious consideration should be given to the efficiency of the practice. 
Several flaws exist in the philosophy of using the offensive linemen as the front line 
on the kick-off return team. Among the points that can be advanced against using 
this fairly common front line makeup are the following: 
e 
The kick off involves open field blocks. 
While some offensive guards are exceptional blockers when pulling out on the 
perimeter because they receive a great deal of practice at this technique a 
pertinent question arises: who is less suited for open-field blocking than an 
offensive lineman? The answer is fairly obvious—nobody. The open field block 
typically required on a kick-off return requires several factors, including speed, 
agility, and a familiarity with making contact with an opponent in an open-field 
setting. As such, linebackers, tight ends, and back-up running backs tend to be 
much more suited for being front-line blockers on a kick-off return. As a rule, 
because they tend to possess the traits that are conducive to effectively 
operating in an open-field situation, they tend to be better blockers than 
offensive linemen on kick-off returns. 
e 
The front line should be always prepared to field a surprise onside kick. 
Offensive linemen—with the exception of the center—never touch the ball. To 
further negate their ability to handle the ball, the offensive linemen commonly 
wear padded gloves. At best, a coach can require his lineman to take off their 
gloves ona 
kick-off return, they normally have little or no time to retrieve their 
gloves and put them back on before play resumes. Besides, most offensive 
linemen tape on their gloves to keep them from slipping when their hands get

sweaty. All factors considered, five offensive linemen stationed as the primary 
receivers of a surprise onside kick is not a “winning” strategy. 
Effective kick-off return schemes normally require the front line to sprint 20 
yards to get into position to set up areturn. 
As stated in Chapter 1, foot speed is not a prerequisite for playing the offensive 
line. All factors considered, however, the kick-off return needs a front line who 
can run. On the other hand, fewer positions on the football team attract players 
who are slower as a unit than the offensive line. As such, placing five offensive 
linemen up front on the kick-off return works against the success of any kick- 
off return scheme other than the wedge return up the middle. 
The kick off removes the opportunity for regrouping the offensive line. 
A lot can be accomplished by huddling your offensive line together as a unit and 
giving them last minute instructions—particularly after a sudden-change 
touchdown by the opponent off of an offensive turnover. The time involved in 
the kick-off return can be used to regroup the offensive linemen and help them 
regain their composure and focus. 
If the offensive linemen are part of the kick-off return, no opportunity exists to 
help them regain their poise. The lack of an opportunity to meet with the 
offensive line after a sudden-change touchdown by a team’s opponent Is a 
detriment to achieving a quick recovery of the team’s level of offensive 
intensity. 
On the other hand, if it is inevitable that a team has to use its offensive linemen as 
an integral part of its kick-off return team, the linemen should be instructed on the 
proper two-point stance of the front line player. A proper stance for a kick-off 
return front player should adhere to the following points: 
The head is up. 
A common flew of the kick-off return stance is caused by an offensive lineman 
leaning forward at the hips in the ready position. The blocker should keep his 
head back so that his facemask is tucked behind the front of the chest. If a 
lineman Is leaning forward with his facemask in front of his shoulders and chest, 
he will have to pop his head back to elevate his chest if has to catch the ball. A 
surprise kick can strike an ill-prepared blocker in the face and shoulder pads. 
The blocker should not have the top of his pads as the forward portion of his 
body. He should squat with his torso erect. 

The knees and the elbows are bent. 
A lineman keeping his torso erect and his shoulders up will result in his chest 
being out. The blocker should then bend at the knees—not the hips—to lower 
his buttocks to the ground. Furthermore, he should bend his elbows so that his 
hands are in front of his body. 
The hands are held palm up. 
The universal ready position of any athletic stance involves rolling the thumbs 
out. This action forces the palm forward toward the kick-off team. By rolling the 
thumbs out with the elbows bent, the palms are then positioned facing up. This 
method gives the lineman the best position for basket-catching or trapping a 
bouncing ball against his body. He should not attempt to catch the ball with his 
fingers pointing to the sky and his palms facing the kicker. Rather, the offensive 
lineman should try to trap the ball against his body in a grasping manner, with 
his hands trapping the ball against his chest. If he misses the ball while 
attempting to trap it against his body, he has the added aid of being able to use 
his forearms to help trap the ball against his body. Plus, by using his arms ina 
clutching manner, he prevents 
the ball from ricocheting off his chest back 
toward the kicking team. If he holds his fingers skyward and his palms forward, 
the natural tendency is to bat the ball back toward the kicking team—should he 
mishandle the kick. 
The feet are under his armpits. 
An offensive lineman should keep a narrow stance when setting up as a front 
line blocker of the kick-off return. The second most common error involving an 
offensive lineman’s kick-off return stance occurs when he widens his feet to 
lower his center of gravity. (The first most common error is the lineman leaning 
forward.) An offensive lineman who is unduly fatigued or an undisciplined 
offensive lineman will widen his stance instead of bending his knees as he 
should. The point to remember is that if a lineman sets his feet too wide, he 
limits his ability to quickly move to either side. 
He should keep his feet under him so that he can quickly move from side to side. 
While an offensive lineman shouldn't move to catch an onside kick (he should 
only field the balls kicked within approximately two feet of his position), an 
offensive lineman should be ready to step to one side and squarely field the 
ball. He should never reach for the ball, rather he should catch the ball squarely 
against his chest. 

e 
The body is turned at a slight angle to the ball. 
The offensive lineman should not face the ball with his shoulders square. He 
should open his shoulders slightly and cock his stance to the inside. 
Among the general rules that an offensive lineman should observe when he Is 
fielding the ball are the following: 
e 
Never move more than two steps to catch a ball kicked to either side. 
e 
Never reach to catch a ball kicked just over your head. 
e 
Never try to catch the ball and run with it. 
e 
After recovering the ball, fall on one side and tuck your knees to your chest 
while cradling the ball to your stomach. 
e 
Physically cover up your teammate when he receives the ball. 
¢ 
Dodge a ball kicked directly at you. Allow a power kick or a line drive kick to go 
through to the back receivers. 
The alignment of the front five on the kick-off team may vary from team to team. 
Normally, a kick-off return team aligns approximately 12 yards off the ball. The 
center should set the front alignment at the 47-yard line on a regular kick off. While 
he may alternate aligning to the right or left of the ball, the center should never 
align directly in front of the ball. The guards should also align on the 47-yard line, at 
a position approximately three yards outside of the NCAA regulation hashmarks. 
The tackles should align at the 48-yard line on the numbers. If the ball is kicked from 
ahashmark, the front line should slide their alignment approximately two yards 
toward the ball. 
The various return schemes require the offensive line to master different 
techniques. A list of the possible return schemes includes the following:

FIELD GOAL—EXTRA POINT 
As with all scrimmage plays, the most important offensive line position is the 
center. Often, a team will replace its regular center on the field goal—extra point 

kick with a specialized player. Teams that adhere to this philosophy (i.e., use a 
specialty snapper) should make sure he begins snapping on the sideline whenever 
the ball is in a position from which a field goal or an extra point is possible. Likewise, 
if the clock is running down and the team is working to get a last second field goal 
opportunity, its deep snapper should be warming up on the sideline. 
An important factor attendant to the deep snapper’s effectiveness is the time it 
takes for the ball to get to the holder. Not only should the ball arrive on target to 
the holder's hands, the ball must be sharply snapped on a straight line to the holder. 
Ideally, the time from the center to the holder should be fast enough to allow the 
kick to be away in under 1.3 seconds. This factor means that the ball should be in 
flight for approximately 0.5 seconds. 
A center snap on the field goal and the extra point is one of the toughest jobs in 
football. Most football teams have an individual who is a natural at deep snapping. 
If a team doesn't have such an individual, the player assuming the deep snapper's 
position can develop his skills provided he has sufficient confidence. A deep snapper 
who Is attempting to refine his skills needs a relatively high degree of self- 
confidence because of the stress involved in snapping the ball in pressure 
situations. He also needs the self-assurance to maintain a positive outlook when 
learning to deep snap. Learning to deep snap involves extra time after practice. A 
prospective deep snapper has to be mentally tough enough to put aside any 
frustration that may arise if he incurs a streak of poor snaps and technique 
breakdowns. He also needs to be extremely coachable—an individual who Is 
unaffected by stressful situations. 
The snap begins with the center's grip on the football. The deep snap begins with 
the center gripping the ball with his four fingers on the laces. The ball should be 
positioned with the laces facing the ground. The center rolls his wrist under the 
ball, cocking his wrist with the ball's forward nose slightly raised so that he can 
firmly grasp the laces with his fingers. If the center were to stand up after gripping 
the ball, he should be holding the ball above his head with his wrist cocked in the 
throwing position. In other words, the center holds the ball exactly as a quarterback 
holds the ball when he is in the throwing motion. When gripping the ball neither the 
center nor the quarterback can allow his wrist to “break” and hyperextend. 
A long snap is, figuratively, a pass thrown between the legs. If the center stands up 
from his snapping position as described in the preceding paragraph, he should be 
able to throw a spiral without adjusting his grip. The ball should be positioned under 
the center's helmet as he addresses the ball. The center's off hand (his left hand for 
a right-handed center) should be lightly placed on the top of the ball. The fingers of 
his off hand should be pointing toward the nose of the ball, as his off-hand rests on 
top of the ball. His strong hand snaps the ball without any assistance from his off 
hand. His off hand is merely a guidance mechanism to help the center deliver the 
snap.

The proper snap mechanics involve the strong hand releasing the ball at exactly the 
right moment. The center's forearms should contact the inside of his thighs as he 
releases the ball. Both hands should be facing upward as the ball is released. The 
common errors of a right-handed snapper and their respective causes are detailed in 
Chart 11-1.

The center should be given the opportunity to make the long snap at will. A ready 
sound can be used to alert the team that the holder is ready and that the snap Is 
soon to follow. Most coaches advise the center to avoid locking himself into a 
rhythm. However, it is solely up to the center as to when he feels comfortable to 
snap the football. A coach should be careful about over coaching the center long 
snap. The long snap is much like a refined golf swing. Too much trivial input from too 
many sources can disrupt what is already nearly perfect. 
In a long-snap situation, the remaining offensive linemen have aresponsibility to 
block high with their shoulders square. Because the long snap is made on a silent 
count, they should look in at the ball as the center addresses the football. While 
many coaches position the guards and the tackles in two-point stances with their 
weight on their heels, | prefer (and recommend) that all of the offensive linemen ina 
long-snap situation (except the center) assume a three-point stance. | believe that 
such a stance enables a lineman to punch upward through the defender as he 
attempts to rush through the line. The guards and the tackles align three inches 
from their adjacent teammate. Their inside foot is back in a slight stagger. Among 
the coaching points for offensive linemen who are blocking on either a field goal or 
an extra point kick are the following:

Listen for the thud of the kick.

of the ball being kicked and blocked, or a fire call alerts the lineman toa 
fumbled snap, a blocked kick, or some other mishap. 
— 
Don't go downfield unless the ball is kicked past the line of scrimmage. 
Never go downfield on a fire call. A fire call is arun/pass play after a 
fumbled snap. 
The field goal and the extra point formation is a static formation throughout all 
levels of play. The test of time has proven one basic formation to be the most 
effective structure for providing protection of the kicker. Diagram 11-1 shows the 
basic balanced formation that is used for field goals and extra points. Diagram 11-2 
illustrates an unbalanced set which is used when the ball is placed on the 
hashmark. An unbalanced protection provides added protection to the wide side of 
the field, thereby allowing the ball to be centered between the flanks in a location 
more toward the center of the field. 
THE PUNT 
Various punt formations and punt blocking schemes exist. For obvious reasons, 
football programs that have a large roster normally don’t use offensive linemen in 
the punt-protection phase. A punt team that is ineffective at fanning out and 
covering the field is a sure way to lose the kicking phase of the game. Since the 
game consists of only three phases—offense, defense, and kicking, surrendering an 
automatic 33% of the game is not conducive to winning. Coaches should consider 
the fact that a tie in the two other phases of the game coupled with a loss of the 
kicking phase generally will result in the loss of the game.

Clearly, most specialized offensive linemen are not well suited for covering kicks. All 
factors considered, in the punting game, a blocker who can't cover is a blocker that 
shouldn't be involved in the punt game. However, most coaches appreciate the 
situation of the small school coach who doesn't have two platoons of offense, 
defense and a special unit for each kicking phase. As such for those individuals who 
coach a team that has a relatively small number of players, no such substitution 
option exists. In these situations, everyone on the team plays every position— 
including the punt game. 
Unlike the field goal and extra point formation, the punt game has sometimes 
become an “exotic tinker toy” for many coaches. As a result, a variety of punt 
formations exist along with various philosophies—philosophies that tend to mimic 
the offensive philosophy of the head coach. Punt formations can range from the 
wide open spread set, to the tight set double wing, to the wide split elephant set. 
Punt formations can involve motion and shifts. A few coaches align their 
quarterback as a personal protector so that they automatically fake when facing a 
certain defensive alignment or adjustment against a shift or motion. Diagrams 11-3 
through 11-8 illustrate some of the various formations that are commonly used in 
punting situations.

Diagram 11-8: The tight punt formation. 
The width of the offensive line splits is a critical coaching point with regard to the 
punt formation. Most punt formations use a center-guard split of a minimum of 
three feet. The most common punt formation, the basic spread punt formation 
shown in Diagram 11-3 and 11-4, uses a center-guard split of three feet along with 
subsequent guard-tackle and tackle-end splits of two feet. The elephant formation 
uses an even wider center-guard split of three feet. The tight punt formation, a 
formation normally used when the punter is standing in the end zone, uses splits of 
slightly over one foot to prevent inside penetration by the defense. 
Most defenders who block punts and who originate from an area outside of the 
offensive tackle get to the punter as a result of inadequate line splits. Blocked 
punts that are aresult of defenders coming from an area between the offensive 
tackles are caused by a breakdown of protection techniques. Tightening the splits 
to correct a protection problem between the tackles normally results in a short 
edge and the increased possibility of a blocked punt from the corner. When 
attempting to diagnose a protection problem between the tackles, a coach should 
look first at his personnel or their technique. When attempting to remedy a 
protection problem occurring outside the tackles, the first factor that should be 
looked at Is the line splits. 
The depth of the punter is the second critical factor in the punt protection scheme. 
Specialty-team gurus at all competitive levels tend to have varying opinions on the 
proper depth of the punter. The standard depth of a punter in the basic spread

formation is 15 yards. Some teams use a tighter formation and position the punter at 
12 to 13 yards. A few teams even punt the ball from eight to ten yards behind the 
center. 
The depth of the punter’s alignment is oc¢asionally related to the punter’s leg 
strength and skill. A young athlete at the lower level can safely punt the ball from 
eight yards deep if he one-steps (i.e., punts the ball after taking only one step). If a 
team has a punter who normally punts the ball at least 20 yards from the line of 
scrimmage and has a deep snapper who can get the ball back to the punter, the 
punter can be positioned anywhere from 12 to 15 yards deep. 
For a punter aligned at a depth of 15 yards, the center should deliver the ball to the 
punter in 0.8 seconds. The kick should be away in 2.1 seconds. Therefore, your 
offensive linemen must protect for at least two seconds for the punter before 
fanning out to cover the punt. The extra 0.1 second is of no consequence, since no 
football player will likely cover 15 yards in a tenth of a second! The snapping 
technique for a punt is identical to the snapping technique of the deep snap on the 
field goal and extra point. More information on the deep-snap technique is provided 
in the section in this chapter on the field goal and extra point. 
The blocking technique of the offensive linemen who are positioned on the line of 
scrimmage in the spread punt formation is a head-up-to-outside blocking technique. 
The blockers use a two-point stance. They should keep their weight on their heels 
and look straight ahead, while keeping the ball in their peripheral vision. Similar to a 
snap for a field goal or an extra point, the snap for a punt is made at the center's 
discretion—no cadence is called. When the ball is snapped, the blockers push off 
their inside foot and drive through the defenders positioned immediately to their 
outside. The blockers extend their arms to punch and stun the defender, as the 
linemen step laterally to the outside. The blockers should attempt to keep their 
inside foot planted if a defender is aligned in a head up position in front of them. If a 
defender is aligned outside of the blocker in the gap, the blocker must drive through 
the rusher and protect the outside gap. If two defenders are in the gap, the blocker 
is responsible for blocking both of the defenders. The key to blocking an outside 
defender on the punt is to drive the inside fist and the forearm into the chest of the 
rusher. 
Generally, a collision and a run through the defender’s outside shoulder is adequate 
protection for the punter to be able to get the ball off. After protecting for the 
punt, the offensive linemen should continue to fan out approximately five yards 
apart as they cover the punt.

Pass Protection Schemes 
A scheme is a combination of blocks which serve as the protection mechanism of a 
play. A scheme can be either a running scheme or a passing scheme. Normally, the 
passing game is formulated around the basis of the protection scheme. As was 
discussed in Chapter 8, a protection scheme can be a play pass scheme in which a 
run is faked, but a pass is executed. A draw blocking scheme is a scheme in which a 
pass is faked, but arun is executed. Other types of pass protections include the 
dash protection scheme, the sprint out pass protection scheme, and the dropback 
pass protection scheme. 
DROPBACK PASS PROTECTION SCHEMES 
An appropriate dropback pass protection scheme is related to two factors: the 
depth of the quarterback drop and the objective of the passing series. A dropback 
passing series may be a three-step series, a five-step series, or a Seven-step series. 
The protection for a three-step series is normally an area protection in which the 
offensive linemen aggressively block their men. The protection for a five-step series 
can be an area protection, a fan-fan protection, a fan-man protection, a man-fan 
protection. The seven-step series protection varies little from the five-man scheme. 
The only difference between a five-man and a seven-man protection is the added 
time needed for the protection of the quarterback. On the seven-step protection, 
the depth of the quarterback drop and the subsequent deeper pass routes of the 
receivers require the blockers to hold their blocks for a longer time. 
AREA PASS PROTECTION SCHEME 
An area protection assigns specific gaps to the offensive linemen. The most 
common area protection scheme calls for the offensive linemen to block the gap to 
their inside. In this type of area protection scheme, the center has no responsibility 
against an even front, other than to assist the guards in anchoring the “A” gaps. 
Against an odd front, or the 7-1 front, the center soft posts the nose tackle and 
anchors the middle. Diagrams 12-1 through 12-4 show this particular area protection 
scheme against four of the basic defensive fronts. 
An area pass protection scheme can be structured as a pure gap protection scheme 
as previously described, or it can be structured according to the man-blocking rule. 
When used as an gap protection, the area scheme is best suited for the quick 
passing game (i.e., one-step and three-step drops). 

Diagram 12-1: An area pass protection scheme versus the 30 front. The tackles have 
no defender inside their gap; they, however, have a man on them. In such a case, the 
tackles apply their “don't block grass” rule and block the 5 techniques while keeping 
their shoulders square.

Diagram 12-4: A gap protection scheme versus a 4-4 front. 
MAN PASS PROTECTION RULES 
A man-blocking rule is a protection principle in which each offensive lineman is 
assigned a particular defensive man to block. Man-protection assignments number 
each defender, whereas gap protection assignments account for the gaps without 
regard to the location or action of the front defenders. As a pass protection 
scheme, the man scheme is best suited for the intermediate (i.¢., five-step) passing 
game. 
The man-protection scheme is built around the recognition and numbering of 
defensive fronts. Different defenders are numbered (usually from the inside-out), 
and the offensive linemen block the numbered defenders. The numbering of the 
defenders is dependent upon the declared strength of the offensive formation. In 
other words, even though the ball moves straight behind the center, the defense is 
counted as if the ball were moving to a specific side of the formation. Normally, the 
strength of the formation is toward the tight end, if a tight end is present in the 
formation. In all cases, the terminology of the passing game will dictate a strong 
and weak side of the formation, regardless of whether the formation is a balanced 
formation or an unbalanced formation. 
When both sides of the line use the man-rule protection, the name of the protection 
is called the man-man protection. The first “man” refers to the strongside of the line 
(i.e., the guard and tackle aligned to the formation’s strength). The second “man” 
refers to the weakside of the line. The center (the center is always a weakside 
protector), the guard, and the tackle to the weakside will apply the man rule. 
Therefore, man-man protection states that each side of the line will protect 
according to the man-protection rule.

Among the basic numbering rules for identifying defenders within a defensive front 
are the following: 
e 
Ahead up nose tackle is always assigned the number “0” (see Diagram 12-5). 
e 
Adefender identified as a 0 technique nose tackle—either onset or offset—is 
assigned the number “0” (see Diagram 12-6). 
e 
Aneven front middle linebacker aligned over the center is assigned the number 
"0" (see Diagram 12-7). 
e 
In aneven defense, the first defender aligned toward the formation’s strength is 
assigned the number “1” (see Diagram 12-8). 
e 
The first defender of an even front aligned opposite the formations strength is 
assigned the number “1” (see Diagram 12-9). 
¢ 
Stacked defenders are numbered according to which gap they attack on the 
snap. The defender who attacks the inside gap is assigned the lower number 
(see Diagram 12-10). 
Diagram 12-5: A head up nose tackle is always assigned the number “0.” 

Diagram 12-8: In an even front, the first defender to the formation’s strength is 
assigned the number “1.” 

Diagram 12-9: In an even front, the first defender opposite the formation’s strength is 
assigned the number “1.” 
Diagram 12-10: Stacked defenders are numbered according to the gap they attack on 
the snap. 
Numbering the defensive fronts requires communication among the offensive 
linemen. The dynamics of the numbering system are connected to the presence—or 
absence—of anose tackle. The question of whether a front is an even or an odd 
front figures strongly in the area protection count of the defenders. Offensively, the 
center always has “0.” The guards each have the respective number “1” to their 
side. The tackles have number “2.” 
An important coaching point that should be emphasized is: because the first man of 
an even front to the weakside is “0,” the second man to the weakside of the center 
is actually “1,” and the third man is actually “2.” This type of numbering system 
works best when the offensive line flip-flops so that the weakside personnel are 
familiar with the numbering system. One way for a team’s offensive linemen to 
grasp the concept is by understanding that in any man blocking system the center

has aman—and the center's man is always number “0.” Since the center always 
blocks weakside in man protection, the first defender counting weakside from the 
center out is numbered “0.” In an odd structure, no such contradiction exists. The 
nose man is always “0,” and the first man to either side of the center is counted as 
1" if there is no stack over the nose. 
Diagrams 12-15 and 12-16 demonstrate the critical link of the front structure to the 
numbering system. Diagram 12-15 shows a standard even front. The offensive 
formation Is strong to the right. (For the sake of simplicity, all of the offensive 
formations discussed in this chapter are strong right.) Because the formation is 
strong right, the first man to the left of the center is counted as “0.” The next 
defender is counted as “1,” and the third defender is counted as “2.” Also, because 
the formation is strong right, the first man from the center counting outward Is “1.” 
The next man to the right is counted as “2” and the third man is counted as “3.”

FAN PASS PROTECTION SCHEME 
Fan protection is also called big-on-big protection. In a fan pass protection scheme, 
the linemen block the defensive linemen and leave the linebackers to the running 
backs. The center will block the nose tackle of an odd front. Against an even front, 
the center will check the first linebacker to the weakside. If the weakside backer 
doesn't show, the center will work back to the weakside in a double-read scanning 
technique. 
The tight end is 
guaranteed a free 
release. 

Diagram 12-19: Fan protection against a 4-3 front. 
When fan blocking the front, the offensive lineman counts from inside out. The 
guard will block the first lineman, while the tackle will block the second lineman. If 
a defensive front is overshifted (i.e., overloaded) to one side, an overload call may be 
necessary to account for all of the rushers. Diagram 12-20 shows both an overload 
scheme and the protection adjustment to account for the four rushers. 
Fan protection requires the running backs to scan from the inside out. If an inside 
linebacker blitzes from his linebacker depth, the running back can pick him up. If the 
linebacker aligns on the line of scrimmage to blitz, the running back alerts to the 
possibility of the rush and slides outside to pick up the third defensive lineman 
rushing from the outside. 

Diagram 12-21: In fan protection, the running back picks up the linebacker if he 
blitzes from off the line of scrimmage. 
Diagram 12-22: Linebacker blitzes from a position on the line of scrimmage against a 
fan protection. 

In the fan protection, the offensive lineman always picks up the most dangerous 
threat inside. Should the nose tackle align in an onset position on the center, the 
center must take the nose man, unless the center makes an overshift call. The 
overshift call tells the guard to take the shifted nose, while the tackle blocks the 
man on him (the defensive tackle). As shown in Diagram 12-20, the running back will 
block the defensive end as the center soft kicks behind the onside guard. 
A fan protection scheme can be combined with a man protection scheme. Diagrams 
12-23 and 12-24 show a fan protection scheme combined with a man protection 
scheme.

DASH PASS PROTECTION SCHEME 
The dash pass protection adhere is an alternative to the dropback scheme. On the 
dash pass protection scheme, the quarterback sprints outside the tackle box with a 
guard leading interference. The dash pass protection scheme helps get the 
quarterback outside—away from the pass rush while giving the offensive linemen an 
opportunity to execute the easier down block against a down defender to the 
inside. Successful dash blocking requires that the blocker not block grass when he 
blocks inside. The “don't block grass” rule states that a blocker shouldn't leave a 
defender on him unblocked if the inside gap is unoccupied, even though the blocker's 
rule is a down block. In other words, an offensive lineman should observe his down- 
block rule if a defender is aligned in the gap. But if no defender is aligned in the 
inside gap, the blocker should block the man on him regardless of the down-blocking 
rule requiring him to block inside. The critical point that should be emphasized is that 
an offensive lineman should never block grass. 
Diagram 12-25: Dash pass protection. 
TURNBACK PASS PROTECTION SCHEME 
Turnback pass protection allows the offensive lineman to angle block to protect a 
gap rather than block a specific defender. On turnback protection, the quarterback 
sprints out to one side of the ball. The offensive linemen simply turn inside and 
block any defender who attempts to penetrate the nearest backside gap. The 
offensive linemen don't react to defensive stunts. instead, they build a wall that 
cannot be pierced by a defender's penetration. The defenders must go around the 
wall or attempt to work down the line across the face of the wall—either defensive 
action will allow the quarterback to get the pass off without pressure from his 
blindside.

To turnback block, the offensive lineman punches with his playside arm and pivots 
on his playside foot. He dropsteps with his backside foot and turns his shoulders 
perpendicular to the line of scrimmage. The turnback blocker then uses both hands 
to punch and drive any defender who attempts to penetrate the inside gap. The 
turnback pass protection scheme is an area protection scheme. 
Diagram 12-26: Turnback pass protection. 
SPRINT OUT PASS PROTECTION SCHEME 
Sprint out protection involves a set to reach by the playside linemen. The playside 
linemen set to reach, while the backside linemen soft post and then pivot as a 
double reader on the backside. The blocking rules of playside sprint-out protection 
are normally the man protection rules with reach technique. The backside rules of 
the sprint out protection is an area protection scheme. 
UNCOVERED DOWN PASS PROTECTION SCHEME 
The uncovered down pass protection is a scheme used with play passing. A play 
pass fakes arun. It makes use of the double-read technique on the backside, as 
offensive linemen who have no immediate threat coming through their gap peel back 
to pick up an outside blitzer. The uncovered down pass protection scheme is 
primarily an area protection used with a two-back attack. The structure of the 
uncovered down protection requires that the first uncovered lineman to the side of 
the fake block inside using a down block technique. As the first covered lineman 
blocks the man on him, each succeeding lineman counting from the covered lineman 

to the backside then blocks the backside gap using a modified turnback technique. 
The appeal of the uncovered down pass protection scheme is the simplicity of the 
scheme. Because the uncovered down protection is an area protection, it requires no 
counting or recognition of fronts. Many coaches favor area protection schemes, 
such as the uncovered down pass protection scheme because such scheme is 
always simpler to execute than man protection schemes.

DRAW BLOCKING 
A draw can be run off of any pass action, but is most commonly run off of dropback 
action. Draws often are best with a fold block on the backside. On a draw, the 
offensive linemen will set to pass protect and engage the defender. An offensive 
lineman will then pass block the rushing offensive lineman, pushing him out of the 
running lane. Against a linebacker, the offensive lineman will set to pass protect as 
if he were area blocking. Once the linebacker opens his stance to drop into the pass 
coverage, the offensive lineman should attack the linebacker. If the linebacker 
recognizes the draw and moves toward the line of scrimmage to make the tackle, 
the offensive lineman should attack the linebacker with a proper run-blocking 
demeanor.
