Run-Blocking Drills 
DRILL #1: EVERY DAY DOT DRILLS (EDDD’S) FOR RUN BLOCKING 
Objective: To develop an offensive linemen’s ability to master the first three steps 
of the various run blocks. 
Equipment Needed: Cones or bags. 
Procedure: 
The five interior linemen form lines within a marked ten-yard area 
according to their position. On the coach's command, five players execute one 
repetition of the specified run-blocking technique for ten yards. The techniques that 
the players execute include: 
The demeanor walk. 
The set to drive with the right foot. 
The set to drive with the left foot. 
The set to reach with the outside foot. 
The down block. 
The trap pull. 
The sweep pull. 
The cut off. 
Coaching Points: 
During the early stages of the season, the coach should focus on the execution 
of the first step of the blocking sequence. 
As the players begin to demonstrate mastery of the first step, the coach should 
shift his attention to developing the correct technique of the second and third 
steps.

DRILL #2: TWO-MAN SLED FIT 
Objective: 
To help an offensive lineman develop a feel for the proper fit into the 
defender. 
Equipment Needed: Two-man sled. 
Procedure: Two linemen position themselves in a three-point stance to block the 
two-man sled. On the coach's command, the players fire out on the pad and make 
contact. The linemen should exhibit the proper run-blocking demeanor as they fit 
with the sled’s pads. The proper fit position involves the blocker keeping his knees 
and ankles bent. He should keep his back flat as he strikes the pad with his hands, 
thereby creating the triangle. The three points of the triangle consist of his hands 
and his head, as his thumbs strike the pad in an up position. The blocker’s facemask 
should be positioned between both of his hands. The head should be slightly higher 
than the plane on which his hands are placed. The player freezes in the fit position 
as the coach checks the technique of the fit. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The players should fit with aright foot set to drive and a left foot set to drive. 
e 
The player's elbows should be held close to his body. 
e 
His face should make minimal contact with the pad; his hands should punch the 
pad away from his face. 
e 
The player should take two steps before striking the pad—the set-to-drive and 
the attack step.

pad. The players should exhibit the proper run-blocking demeanor as they fit with 
the sled’s pads. The proper fit position involves the linemen keeping his knees and 
ankles bent. He should keep his back flat as he strikes the pad with his hands, 
thereby creating the triangle. The three points of the triangle consist of his hands 
and his head, as his thumbs strike the pad in an up position. The blocker's facemask 
should be positioned between both of his hands. On the fit, the lineman’s head 
should be slightly higher than the plane on which his hands are placed. Each player 
extends his arms as he punches through the pad of the sled. After the players have 
driven the sled for several feet, the coach blows the whistle, and the players stop 
driving the sled and return to the fit position.

DRILL #4: TWO-MAN SLED PUT IT TOGETHER DRILL 
Objective: To help offensive linemen develop a feel for the proper fit and run- 
blocking demeanor when blocking the defender. 
Equipment Needed: Two-man sled. 
Procedure: Two linemen position themselves in a three-point stance to block the 
two-man sled. On the coach's command, the players fire out on the pad and drive the 
sled. The players should exhibit the proper run-blocking demeanor as they fit with 
the sled’s pads. The proper fit position involves the player keeping his knees and 
ankles bent. He should keep his back flat as he strikes the pad with his hands, 
thereby creating the triangle. The three points of the triangle consist of his hands 
and his head, as his thumbs strike the pad in an up position. The blocker's facemask 
should be positioned between both of his hands. His head should be slightly higher 
than the plane on which his hands are placed. The players drive their hands through 
the pad and extend their arms as they drive the sled. The coach blows the whistle, 
and the players stop and return to the fit position. 
Coaching Points: 
The player's elbows should be held close to his body. 
The player's face should make minimal contact with the pad; his hands should 
punch the pad away from his face. 
The player should take two steps before striking the pad—the set-to-drive and 
the attack step. 
The upper screws of the player's facemask should be positioned below the top 
of the sled pads. 
This drill can be done with the players blocking from three positions: directly in 
front of the pad; offset to the inside of the pad; and offset to the outside of 
the pad.

DRILL #5: LINE SURGE DRILL 
Objective; To develop the offensive unit's explosiveness off the ball and 
anaerobically condition the blockers’ legs. 
Equipment Needed: Five-man sled. 
Procedure: 
The offensive line aligns in a three-point stance to block the five-man 
sled. On the coach's command, the players fire out on the pad and drive the sled. The 
players should exhibit the proper run-blocking demeanor as they fit with the sled’s 
pads. The proper fit position involves each linemen keeping his knees and ankles 
bent. He should keep his back flat as he strikes the pad with his hands creating the 
triangle. The triangle consists of his hands and head, as his thumbs strike the pad 
with the thumbs up. The blocker’s facemask should be positioned between both 
hands. The head should be slightly higher than the plane on which his hands are 
placed. The players drive their hands through the pad and extend their arms as they 
drive the sled. The coach blows the whistle to stop the players. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The player's elbows should be held close to his body. 
e 
The athlete's face should make minimal contact with the pad; his hands should 
punch the pad away from his face. 
e 
The player should take two steps before striking the pad—the set-to-drive and 
the attack step. 
e 
This drill can be performed with the players blocking from three positions: 
directly in front of the pad; offset to the inside of the pad; and offset to the 
outside of the pad. 
¢ 
This drill is an excellent drill to hone the player's ability to respond to audibles. 
e 
The offensive line may be directed to come out of a four-point goal line stance 
to sharpen their goal-line surge technique.

DRILL #6: THREE-ON-THREE DRILL 
Objective: To develop the offensive lineman’s ability to get off on the ball, knock the 
defender backward according to the three-inch rule, and finish the block. 
Equipment Needed: Four cones to designate the corners of a ten-yard square. 
Procedure: 
The drill is structured so that the blockers work across the field 
between two ten-yard designations. The ball is placed in the middle of the ten-yard 
segment—on a line marking the five-yard designation. The cones are placed on the 
four corners of the ten-yard area. Three running backs are aligned in aT set anda 
quarterback is positioned behind the offensive line. Three defensive linemen or 
linebackers align in head-up alignments on the blockers. The offensive linemen and 
the backs are told where the ball will hit and which back will carry the ball. On the 
snap of the ball, the offensive linemen execute a drive block on the head-up 
defender, as the quarterback hands the ball off to one of the running backs. As the 
one back gets the ball, the other two backs run laterally to fake. The blockers 
Sustain contact until a coach blows the whistle. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
Thecoach should make sure that the blockers fit into the defenders and that 
they maintain the techniques of a proper run-blocking demeanor. 
e 
The offensive line may be directed to come out of a four-point goal line stance 
to sharpen their goal line surge technique. 
e 
The players should be rotated out of the drill either after three snaps or after 
the ball carrier breaks the plane of the ten-yard “end zone’ line.

DRILL #7: SEMINOLE DRILL 
Objective: To develop the offensive lineman’s ability to get off on the ball, knock the 
defender backward according to the three-inch rule, and finish the block. 
Equipment Needed: One 8" x 2" x 12” blocking board. 
Procedure: Two players straddle a blocking board near the midpoint of the board and 
face each other. The players take their stance approximately a football's length 
apart. The coach initiates the contest with a verbal or whistle command. On the 
starting command from the coach, both players attempt to drive the other off the 
end of the board. The coach blows the whistle to signal the end of the contest 
either when one blocker knocks the other off the end of the board or when one 
blocker breaks his straddle of the board by stepping one foot over the board. 
Coaching Points: 
¢ 
If feasible, | recommend matching an offensive lineman against a defensive 
lineman in the drill. If not, two offensive linemen could be matched against each 
other. 
e 
The players should attempt to keep their feet on either side of the board (i.e., 
straddling the board). 
Diagram 7-7. 

DRILL #8: GROUP RUN DRILL 
Objective: To develop the offensive line’s timing of the running game at full speed 
versus a Scout team defense. 
Equipment Needed: A football. 
Procedure: 
The drill is usually structured according to a script and typically involves 
part of the defense (i.e., no secondary) and only part of the offense (i.e., no wide 
receivers). A defensive scout coach shows the defense an alignment card or calls a 
known front. Two offensive huddles form in front of the defense. A play is 
communicated to the quarterback of the lead huddle. The quarterback calls the 
play and the snap count, and the offensive line sprints to the line of scrimmage. The 
play is executed, the whistle is sounded, and the players jog back to the huddle. The 
coaches should provide feedback to the players (i.e., do their coaching) as the 
players return to the huddle. Once the first group returns to the huddle, the coaches 
switch their attention to the second huddle as the play is communicated to the 
quarterback. The sequence repeats for the second group. 
Coaching Points: 
The coaches should not stop the players to talk to them between the huddle 
break and the snap of the ball. 
The coaches should move about quickly, running along with the players and 
giving them feedback as they return to the huddle. 
A play should be repeated after the next huddle break if the play's execution 
was flawed. 
This drill is an excellent drill in which to include the weekly check-offs for the 
team's audible system. 
The script should be structured so that the defensive unit keeps the same 
alignment for three to four repetitions before changing alignments.

DRILL #9: TEAM RUN DRILL 
Objective: To develop the offensive line's timing of the running game at full speed 
versus an 11-man scout team defense. 
Equipment Needed: A football. 
Procedure: Similar to Drill #8 (the group drill) this drill involves an entire offensive 
and an entire defensive team. The drill is usually structured according to a script. A 
defensive scout coach shows the defense an alignment card or calls a defensive 
front. A full offensive huddle forms in front of the defense. A play is communicated 
to the quarterback. The quarterback calls the play and the snap count, and the 
offensive line sprints to the line of scrimmage. The play is executed, the whistle is 
sounded, and the players jog back to the huddle. The coaches should do their 
coaching as the players return to the huddle. Once the group returns to the huddle, 
another play is immediately signaled to the quarterback. The sequence repeats until 
the drill is concluded. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The game situation is scripted and explained to all of the participants. 
e 
The ball is moved according to game situations. 
e 
The play is directed as a simulated game. 
e 
When the offense is playing live versus the number one defensive unit, the yard 
chains may be used instead of scripting down-and-distance.

DRILL #10: SHOOT FIT TO DRIVE DRILL 
Objective: To help the offensive lineman develop a feel for the proper fit of a drive 
block. 
Equipment Needed: A shoot. 
Procedure: A blocker stands assumes a three-point stance in the shoot (i.e., chute) 
and a defender stands immediately outside of the shoot. The blocker engages the 
defender with the proper fit of a run-blocking demeanor. The coach checks the 
coaching points of the fit and provides feedback to the blocker. Once the proper fit 
is established by the blocker and confirmed by the coach, the coach signals the 
blocker to drive block the defender from the fit position. When the coach blows the 
whistle, the blocker finishes the block by forcefully extending his arms and pushing 
the defender off the fit. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The.blocker should demonstrate a proper run-blocking demeanor as he uses 
small power steps to drive block the defender. 
e 
The blocker should be positioned just under the far end of his shoot, with his 
head just outside of the shoot. 
Diagram 7-10. 

DRILL #11: DRIVE SETS 
Objective: To practice firing off the ball in three of the eight possible directions with 
the proper set to drive. 
Equipment Needed: Six cones. 
Description: 
The linemen are stationed in two lines. The cones are positioned as 
shown, five yards from the starting point of the corresponding line. The drill is 
divided into three phases. The first phase is straight-ahead starts. Each lineman 
sets to drive with the outside foot, while pushing off the inside foot. The lineman 
Sprints to cone number one and jogs around behind the cones to return to the line. 
The second phase is an angle step to the second cone, while the third phase is a 
trap pull step to the cone on the line of scrimmage. The linemen switch lines so that 
they practice setting to drive to the right and left, angle stepping to the right and 
left, and pulling to the right and left. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The athlete should be reminded to place his weight on his inside foot. 
e 
The athlete should be encouraged to throw his hands forward in a simulated 
punch as he pushes off the push foot. 
e 
The coach checks for mastery of the set to drive techniques by observing the 
length of the first step. He should set to drive with a four- to five-inch stride. 
e 
The athlete's stride should be a firm plant, not a heel-strike. 
Diagram 7-11: Starts. 

DRILL #12: OFF THE BALL DRILL 
Objective: To practice the punch and lift of the drive block. 
Equipment Needed: Two large blocking dummies. 
Description: Two \ines are formed. Each player area blocks the dummy, with his face 
in the middle of the dummy. The player throws his hands on the snap and punches 
and lifts the dummy, as his feet churn and his hips sink. The players alternate using a 
right and left set to drive against various defensive alignment shades. 
Coaching Points: 
¢ 
The blocker should drive the dummy with a lifting motion and the punch of the 
hands prevents the face from making a forceful contact with the dummy. 
e¢ 
The coach should check the stride length of the first step in order to reinforce 
the set to drive technique. 
¢ 
The players should block the dummy for an unspecified distance until the 
whistle is blown. The point to remember is that the players should not block for 
a designated distance (i.e., 10 yards, 5 yards, etc.). 

DRILL #13: DOUBLE TEAM COMBO DRILL 
Objective: To refine the technique of the double team combination against two 
possible defensive reactions by a linebacker and a defensive lineman. 
Equipment Needed: Two large blocking dummies. 
Description: Two lines are formed. One line is designated as the post blocker line. 
The other line is designated as the seal blocker line. To simulate a defensive 
lineman, the dummy holder positions his dummy on the outside shade of the post 
blocker. To simulate a linebacker, the second dummy holder stands to the inside ina 
ready position. On the coach's command, the blockers drive the defensive lineman 
backward, while executing the proper technique of a double team/combo block. The 
linebacker attacks the line of scrimmage on one of two paths. The linebacker can 
scrape over the top as the defensive lineman attempts to slide inside, or the 
linebacker can force underneath the double team as the defensive linemen attempts 
to maintain outside leverage on the post blocker. Both blockers should drive the 
lineman until the linebacker shows his intentions. If the linebacker scrapes 
underneath, the double team turns into an inside-out combo with the inside 
linebacker on the linebacker. If the linebacker scrapes over the top of the double 
team, the double team turns into a post-seal combo with the outside blocker 
sealing the linebacker. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The coach checks for the proper technique of the post blocker and the lead 
blocker. 
e 
The lead blocker must get his hip to contact the hip of the post blocker. 
e 
The dummy must be blocked on a vertical path.

DRILL #14: OUTSIDE ZONE DRILL 
Objective: To teach the technique of the fire block. 
Equipment Needed: One large blocking dummy and one hand-held small shield. 
Description: 
The large blocking dummy is held on the inside shade of the outside 
blocker while the defender holding the hand-held shield simulates a linebacker. The 
outside blocker sets to reach with his outside foot and takes an upfield step at 
slightly less than 45 degrees. The outside blocker rips his inside arm to the pad and 
drives his inside shoulder through the outside '/2 of the dummy. The outside blocker 
should knock the dummy inside to his teammate and continue to the second level to 
execute a shoulder block on the shield-holder. The inside (i.e., backside) blocker 
steps laterally with his outside foot opened slightly and pointing upfield. The 
backside blocker attempts to get his outside earhole to the near hip of the outside 
blocker. The backside blocker then continues on an arcing path upfield and places 
his head to the outside of the large dummy. The backside blocker should drive the 
large dummy ona 
vertical path as he swings his tail around to the outside. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The coach checks for spacing between the blockers. No spacing should exist 
between the blockers as the trail blocker takes over the large dummy. 
e 
Avvertical push on the large dummy should be accomplished before the outside 
blocker moves to the next level.

DRILL #15: ANGLE BLOCK DRILL 
Objective: To practice the two angle blocks—the down block and fan block—versus 
a gap charging defender. 
Equipment Needed: Two large blocking dummies and a hand-held small shield. 
Description: Two dummies are placed on the ground five to six feet apart. The hand 
shield holder aligns on the shade of the blocker. On a snap count, the defender 
charges across the line of scrimmage. The blocker angle blocks the shield holder, 
using the proper angle block technique. The coach may widen the shield holder once 
the blocker becomes skilled at the angle block. The drill may also be run live 
without the shield. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The blocker must place his head across the defender at the appropriate 
landmark. 
e 
The blocker must punch the offside arm to the armpit of the gap charging 
defender. 
e 
The coach should make sure the blocker's head Is up.

DRILL #16: SWEEP PULL DRILL 
Objective: To develop the hammer pull technique and the wall pull technique of the 
sweep pull. 
Equipment Needed: Two large blocking dummies, two small hand shields, and five 
cones. 
Description: Two lines of offensive guards are formed. The large dummies are lain on 
the ground as shown. One shield holder stands at position #1, while another shield 
holder stands at position #2. The lead guards pulls to a three-yard depth, gets his 
shoulders upfield, and hammer steps to drive through the large dummies on the 
ground. The hammer blocking guard will block the shield holder to the outside. The 
backside guard pulls on the inside hip of the hammer guard and drives through shield 
#1. The backside guard uses his inside shoulder to deliver a blow on the shield as he 
continues downfield for 10 yards. The drill is flipped over so that the guards can 
work on the sweep pull techniques to the left. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The coach checks to see if both guards enter the vertical alley with their 
shoulders square. 
¢ 
The hammer pull and the wall pull are used on other plays (e.g., bootleg, 
reverse, waggle). 
Diagram 7-16: Sweep pull drill. 

DRILL #17: SHORT TRAP DRILL 
Objective: To sharpen the timing of the center's back block and the guard's short 
trap technique. 
Equipment Needed: A football and two large blocking dummies. 
Description: During the drill, the center snaps the ball to the backup center and 
executes a back block (i.e., down block) against a large blocking dummy positioned 
headup on the guard. The guard handshake points and tracks to the target dummy 
positioned across the ball. The trapping guard uses a shoulder block to dig out the 
dummy, as the center blocks back for the guard. The trap dummy holder alternates 
between closing the gap and charging up field. The dummy holders should turn the 
dummies inward. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The coach checks the center’s footwork to see if he pushes off the opposite 
foot. 
e 
The coach checks the pulling guard to make sure he is using the correct shoulder 
to hit the dummy.

DRILL #18: CUTOFF AND ALLEY BREAK DRILL 
Objective: To perfect the cutoff block and practice the horizontal break to the alley. 
Equipment Needed: One large blocking dummy, two small hand-shields, and four 
cones. 
Description: 
The blocker dips under the large dummy, throwing his outside arm into 
the large dummy. The blocker continues on an arc inside of the shield-holder at four- 
yards depth. The blocker angles to the cone at a seven-yard depth and cuts across 
the field on a 90-degree angle. The blocker delivers a face-up blow to the second 
hand-shield. The second hand-shield simulates a linebacker, while the third hand- 
shield simulates a free safety attempting to fill the alley. The coach may alter the 
drill by having the second shield holder attack the alley from a free-safety position 
to simulate the free safety. In this case, the blocker must get his head across the 
front of the shield holder. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The coach should emphasize to the blocker that he must throw an uppercut 
punch through the large dummy and the simulated linebacker. 
e 
The coach should encourage the blocker to sprint full speed to the alley. 
Diagram 7-18: Cutoff alley break drill. 

DRILL #19: WAGGLE DRILL 
Objective: To isolate the offensive guard's pulling and reading technique needed for 
the waggle. 
Equipment Needed: Five cones and two small hand shields. 
Description: 
The guards practice the appropriate technique for pulling on the 
waggle. The lead guard executes a log pull, while the backside guard executes a 
long sweep pull. The coach may evolve the basic drill to a read drill by having shield 
#1 charge upfield on a defensive stunt, thereby forcing the lead guard to kick the 
shield holder out. The backside guard must read the action of the lead guard. If the 
lead guard logs, the backside guard kicks out shield #2. If the lead guard kicks out, 
the backside guard can log at the edge. The coach may further increase the 
difficulty of the drill by directing the shield holders to run an X stunt, thereby 
forcing the lead guard to kick out as the backside guard log blocks. 
Coaching Paints: 
e 
The coach should stand in front of the drill to check the guard's eyes. 
e 
The coach should emphasize that the waggle will be likely be set up for a 
situation in which the lead blocker logs and the backside blocker kicks out.
