One-Man Blocks 
Run blocking is divided into three categories: man blocking techniques; two-man 
blocking techniques, and pull techniques*. Blocks categorized as man blocks are 
characterized as being techniques executed by only one lineman. The various types 
of man blocking include the following:

When a blocker puts together the coaching points of an effective run block, he is 
said to be in the proper run-blocking demeanor. A key part of every run block, 
establishing a proper run-blocking demeanor figures heavily into the execution of 
one-man blocks. 
THE RUN-BLOCKING DEMEANOR 
The proper run-blocking demeanor is a combination of the correct body positioning 
and the blocker's movement during the “fit” stage of the block. A blocker fits with 
the defender at the moment of contact. A proper fit is a position that allows the 
blocker to maintain a sufficient blocking surface on the defender. The fit includes 
the stage of the block in which the offensive lineman maximizes his leverage. The 
proper run-blocking demeanor is an important aspect of the man blocks, particularly 
the drive block. A blocker exhibiting the correct blocking demeanor should 
demonstrate the following: 
e 
Hips low 
e 
Toes pointing outward 
e 
Knees bent 
e 
Shoulders slightly elevated 
e 
Ankles flexed 
e 
Elbows tight to the body 
e 
Feet slightly wider than shoulder width 
¢ 
Hands open with thumbs up 
e 
Lower back arched (i.e., hyperextended)

Chapter 6.

Toes turned slightly outward. 
e 
Knees turned slightly inward. 
e 
Hands to target. Depending on the type of angle desired, a flipper or both hands 
should be punched into the chest of the opponent in a low-to-high lifting 
fashion. 
e 
Elbows remain tucked inward while the thumbs point upward. 
e 
Pad under pad. The shoulders of the blocker should be lower than the shoulders 
of the defender. 
e 
The chinis kept level so that the head remains level while the neck is bowed. 
e 
Head remains behind the plane of the chest with the screws of the headgear 
facing forward. 
The mechanics of the correct blocking demeanor should be practiced on a year- 
round basis. Similar to a proper golf swing, the correct blocking demeanor has 
multiple components which must fall into place. You should continually drill the 
players in the development of the individual components of the blocking demeanor. 
Slow-speed drills with an emphasis on controlled movement help to keep the 
offensive lineman finely tuned on the mechanics of maintaining the proper 
demeanor. 
DRIVE BLOCK 
Of all the man blocks, the most basic is the drive block. Illustrated in Diagrams 3-2 
and 3-3, the drive block is at the core of the man-on-man struggle in the trench. 
Mastering the techniques involved in the drive block is essential for an offensive 
lineman developing a complete repertoire of skills. As an offensive line coach, it 
should be your objective to develop at least five offensive linemen and two tight 
ends who can whip their opponent with a drive block. You should keep in mind that 
the outcome of most of the two-man blocking techniques usually depends on the 
movement created by a drive blocker. 
The drive block consists of three main elements: the set to drive; the attack step; 
and the leverage step. The set to drive is the departure step of the offensive 
lineman (i.e., the first step of the blocker). This step is a four-inch jab step that 
serves as either a directional step or a settle step. The set to drive is a directional 
step when the offensive lineman is firing off the line to meet the stunting defender. 
When the defender is not a threat to stunt, the set to drive is a settle step. 
Setting to drive entails the lead foot grazing the turf to quickly plant and enhance 
the power of the offensive lineman’s demeanor. It is important for the offensive

lineman to arch his lower back and flex his large muscle groups as he sets to drive. 
His eyes should focus on the target or the point-of-aim as he attacks the neutral 
zone. 
The attack step is the offensive lineman’s second step. When drive blocking a 
defensive lineman, the attack step is made just before contact is made with the 
defender. Ideally, the offensive blocker should make contact with the down 
defender after the third step; however, contact is usually made with the down 
defender after two and one-half steps. The attack step is also a tracking step. On 
the attack step, the blocker’s inside foot steps toward the defender’s inside foot, 
thereby putting the blocker on the track to strike the landmark witha full blocking 
surface. The attack step propels the blocker through the neutral zone as the blocker 
gains momentum to hit through the defender. 
“Hit through them, not to them” is a good phrase to use when coaching 
inexperienced offensive linemen. Beginning offensive linemen tend to stop at the 
moment of contact. As an offensive line coach, you should note that while blocking 
is a fundamental part of football, it is one of the more unnatural physical acts in the 
world of sports. 
Blocking should be taught in a manner that enables a blocker to overcome his fear of 
propelling his body into an opponent. One way of accomplishing this objective is to 
teach young kids to block through relatively soft dummies that are held with 
minimum resistance. In keeping with the concept of minimum resistance, you should 
refrain from standing on the blocking sled during repetitions. Indeed, many young 
players are not strong enough to explode through the heavier five-man and seven- 
man sleds. Standing on sleds only teaches the young offensive lineman to “hunker” 
on contact with the pad, the result being the development of major mechanical 
flaws and a negative psychological outlook on blocking. 
The next step (i.e., the third step) after the attack step is the leverage step. 
Against an outside shaded defender such as a 3 technique, the leverage step is 
made with the outside foot. The leverage step allows the blocker to gain depth and 
initiate the finish of the block. It is on this step that the blocker gets the lift on the 
defender as the fit is secured. The blocker should fit snuggly with his pads under the 
defender’s pads. “Pads under pads” is the commonly used phrase used to reinforce 
the concept of fitting with the defender on the third step. You should coach your 
linemen to attempt to get the third step down before contact is made. The three- 
step progression must be made with four-inch strides completed in rapid fire 
succession. 
The net result of the rapid three-step departure to gain leverage with pad-under-

inch rule.” | recommend using a three-inch rule in determining a blocker’s production. 
The three-inch rule of offensive line blocking states that if the blocker can achieve a 
vertical dominance on the defender in a manner to knock him back off the line 
approximately three inches, the blocker will be successful in his block. In other 
words, after a blocker engages a defender, it is a matter of whether the blocker can 
achieve only three inches of movement. My years of experience have led me to 
believe that in the first fraction of a second the success of a block is determined. 
Almost without fail, a blocker who achieves three inches of movement and 
maintains a proper fit with the opponent will dominate the defender. 
Lift is achieved primarily from the violent punch and thrust of the hands through the 
opponent's chest. Shooting the hands from the knee and ground causes the blocker's 
hips to snap forward on contact. As the hips snap forward, the feet must accelerate 
to chase the hips, thus providing even more momentum to the blocker’s forward 
thrust. By forcing the defender to elevate his head and pads, the blocker is able to 
finish the block. Once the defender elevates and the blocker begins to chase his hips 
by accelerating his feet, the defender becomes off balance and vulnerable to being 
pancaked. 
By simply running through the defender and not to him, the blocker can shoot the 
hands, elevate the defender, and pile drive him into the turf after he topples. 
Multiple pancakes during a ball game invariably swing the psychological pendulum in 
favor of the offensive lineman. Few things are more mentally devastating to a 
defender than being pancaked on multiple occasions during the early part of a game. 
Another way for a lineman to finish the block is to maintain contact until the 
whistle blows. If your lineman forces his opponent to take an extra step to get to 
the ball carrier, your lineman has achieved a degree of success. The question to 
answer is a question of accountability. Did the blocker inhibit or prevent the 
defender from getting to the ball carrier? If the answer is yes, the blocker measured 
up to his level of accountability in executing the drive block. Diagrams 4-1 to 4-3 
illustrate three types of different drive blocks (an inside shade, an outside shade, 
and a man over you). 
CUT-OFF BLOCK 
A cut-off block is commonly called a scramble block. A cut-off block is a backside 
blocking technique. This factor means that the ball carrier is moving away froma 
cut-off blocker. The objective of a cut-off block is to stop the penetration and 
pursuit of the defender. When the ball is moving toward the far end of the offensive 
line, the cut-off block is a useful technique against the inside shade alignments of 
down defenders. Most productive when the ball is being run wide, a cut-off block is 
especially effective against inside slanting technique defenders.

When executing a cut-off block, the blocker pushes off his outside foot and steps 
with the inside foot to gain playside leverage on the down defender. On the second 
step, the blocker throws his backside arm and leg through the crotch of the 
defensive lineman. Since the defender will be moving inside as a result of his 
response to either the lead step of the blocker or a predetermined slant called in 
the defensive huddle, the blocker should throw his backside fist to the inside of the 
defender’s playside knee. Throwing the backside fist to the inside of the defender's 
playside knee will result in the backside arm hooking the defender between his 
crotch and playside knee. Furthermore, throwing the backside arm in this manner 
will keep the blocker’s backside shoulder low and level. Punching through the crotch 
with the backside arm also keeps the blocker’s playside shoulder free. Keeping the 
playside shoulder free guarantees that the blocker will obtain inside leverage on 
the defender—a key coaching point for the cut-off block. 
Once inside leverage has been obtained, the blocker will bear crawl for several feet 
upfield. His shoulders should remain square as he quickly bear crawls to the second 
level. Once the blocker has cleared the first level, he should snap to his feet and 
sprint to the alley. The cut-off is a quick, sharply executed block. The blocker should 
not be concerned with the reaction of the defender. He must quickly scramble inside 
and get upfield to sprint to the alley. 
If the defender makes contact with the cut-off blocker and a wreck occurs, the 
blocker should fight to his feet and sprint to the third level. Components of a 
successful cutoff block include the following: 
e 
Pushing strongly off the outside foot. 
e 
Setting to reach with the lead foot to gain inside leverage upfield. 
e 
Throwing the backside arm through the crotch of the defender. 
@ 
Squaring the shoulders and bear crawling upfield to the second level. 
¢ 
Getting to his feet on the run and sprinting to the alley. 
DOWN BLOCK 
A down block is an angle block toward the inside (i.e., toward the center). The down 
blocker will choose one of two landmarks to attack. The scouting report may 
dictate the choice of the landmark. Another factor to consider is the defender’s 
technique during the last few scrimmage downs, or during the last scrimmage of a 
similar down-and-distance situation. Two landmarks are possible because a down 
defender will demonstrate one of two techniques. He may be a penetrator (i.e., a 
defender who attacks the line of scrimmage on the snap), or he may be a reader (i.e., 
a defender who sits on the line of scrimmage and reacts to the blocking scheme). 

Diagram 4-4: The cut-off block. 
A penetrator has little regard for the particular blocking scheme. His role is to 
charge the line of scrimmage. By charging the line, the penetrating defender hopes 
to force your offensive linemen to tighten their splits. 
In order to block a penetrator, the offensive lineman should aim for the opposite 
shoulder of the defender. The blocker should drive his outside arm and pad through 
the near shoulder of the defender as his facemask fits into the neck of the 
defender. He must keep his hips down and his lower back arched as he punches 
through the defender. The blocker should punch his inside hand to the chest of the 
defender while he drives his outside hand under the armpit of the penetrating 
defender. Driving the fist up through the near armpit of the defender forces the 
defender’s near shoulder to elevate, thus increasing the likelihood of a pancake 
block. When punching through the near armpit of the penetrating defender, the 
blocker's outside hand should be kept open so that he may wedge the armpit 
between his thumb and index finger. Positioning the outside hand to wedge the 
armpit gives the blocker an excellent feel of the defender’s escape move. The hand 
locks in the defender, cements the fit, and prevents his escape. 
A read technique defender will attempt to anchor the gap and fight the pressure of 
the blocker. He will attempt to cross the face of the blocker and fight outside ona 
lateral plane. The read technique down lineman is usually exceptionally strong in his 
upper body. Using his outside shoulder, this type of defensive lineman will dip and rip 
his inside shoulder across the face of the blocker to pursue toward the outside. 
Since the read technique defensive lineman doesn't move forward to any significant 
depth, the proper aiming point for the blocker is on a sharper angle from the blocker. 
The blocker doesn’t fire out on a flat angle to block down on the reading defender. 
The aiming point against the reading defender is the defender’s hip, not his shoulder.

Because the inside reading defender will usually get an outside pull read by the 
inside blocker, the defender will be on the move toward the outside at the moment 
of the down blocker’s contact.

Diagram 4-6: When the center executes a down block, it is called a back block. 
If the down blocker were to aim for the defender’s shoulder, the read technique 
defender would gain several inches of clearance across the blocker’s face. By aiming 
to the hip of the defensive reader, the down blocker can meet the defender with a 
secure fit as the defender reacts to the outside pull read. The finish technique is the 
same finish technique that is used against the penetrator. The outside hand, arm, 
and shoulder provide a violent thrust and lift into the outside half of the defender’s 
body. The well-coached defender will keep his shoulders nearly parallel to the line 
of scrimmage as he reacts to the outside pull. (If the defender commits the

technique error of “facing up” to the blocker, he will be hit head on and easily 
pancaked by the down blocker’s momentum.) The blocker should use his inside hand 
to punch across the defender’s chest and grab cloth. His outside hand cements the 
fit and prevents the defender’s escape. 
If the landmark is correctly secured and the fit is cemented, the down blocker can 
easily dominate the inside defender. By the same token, the size of the split should 
be directly related to the capabilities of the down blocker (i.e., the more skilled the 
blocker, the greater the split). For example, if a blocker is ineffective when down 
blocking, you should first consider cutting his split. For young players it is 
particularly important that you build from success, instead of correct from failure. 
This means that you should develop the down blocking technique of young linemen 
from smaller splits. Developing the inexperienced lineman’s down blocking technique 
from a tighter split gives him the opportunity to experience the feel of success. A 
smaller distance between the defender and the blocker allows the blocker to 
concentrate on his departure, demeanor, and finish of the block. Working from 
inflexible, fixed splits is a waste of time if your linemen aren't physically capable of 
controlling the split. You should concentrate on teaching the technique of the down 
block first, then gradually widen the splits as your linemen become more skilled at 
down blocking. 
Some coaches install a system of splits without taking into account the 
undeveloped down blocking skills of younger linemen. They are eventually forced to 
tighten the splits so that the blockers can achieve their goal. Achieving the goal is 
then complicated further by the blocker’s fear of failure and lack of confidence 
caused by his previous inability to control the larger split. It is much better to start 
with tighter splits and progress to down blocking with wider splits. The point to 
keep in mind is that it is easier to build from success than from failure. 
Successful down blocking is a matter of the linemen adhering to several coaching 
points, including: 
e 
Keeping the eyes and hands on target. 
e 
Keeping the hips down. 
e 
Keeping a proper run-blocking demeanor. 
e 
Being able to redirect to prevent the defender’s escape. 
The most common error of a down blocker relates to his blocking angle. Down 
blocking on too sharp an angle allows the penetrating defender to easily drive 
through the head of the blocker. Down blocking on too flat an angle allows the 
reading defender to easily rip his inside arm across the face of the blocker in an 
uppercut fashion. The reading defender can also easily spin-out against the down 
blocker who targets the landmark on too flat an angle.

INFLUENCE BLOCK 
Two types of influence blocks exist. Each of the types of influence blocks is a block 
that combines the technique of two different blocks. The influence block is part of 
a trapping scheme. 
A trap scheme is a blocking scheme in which a lineman pulls on a trap angle from the 
offside. The trap scheme is one of the oldest blocking schemes in football. Some 
football coaches of the premodern era felt that the block should be outlawed due 
to its inherent trickery. It was deemed by many to be unsportsmanlike—and, as such, 
was given the slightly ill-suited name of “mouse-trap.” The name was eventually 
shortened into the currently used expression “trap”—a less colorful moniker but a 
more football-like term. 
One type of influence block—the pass influence block—is a baiting mechanism to 
draw the defensive lineman upfield to open a crease inside and make the defender a 
relatively easy target for the trapper. The pass influence block is a combination of a 
modified pass set and a trap pull. This block requires the blocker to pop his head and 
hands up to give the defensive lineman a “high-hat” read. This pass set tricks the 
defender into charging upfield to pass rush. The timing of the second phase of the 
pass influence block is such that just as the defender has his momentum going 
forward to rush the passer, the blocker pushes hard off his inside foot and takes a 
sharp inside-out trapping angle toward the nearest outside defender. In essence, 
two traps occur—the kick-out of the nearest outside defender by the influence 
blocker and the trap of the baited defender.

The second type of influence block—the pull influence block—is a baiting 
mechanism to draw the defender outward with an outside pull read. The pull 
influence is used in offenses that incorporate an extensive guard pulling game for 
sweeps and toss plays. If successful, it results in a wide gash opening inside of the 
defender, thereby giving the trapper an excellent trapping angle. 
Diagram 4-11: An influence pull by the right guard. 
A successful influence block includes the blocker adhering to the following 
coaching points: 
e 
Selling the influence whether it is a pass influence or a pull influence. 
e 
Pushing off the inside foot to dig into the line of scrimmage and kick-out the 
nearest outside defender. 
¢ 
Sway up into a good pass pro demeanor. 
LEVEL BLOCK 
A level block is a backside blocking technique used exclusively by the tackle. The 
level block is normally used by the backside tackle when he happens to be aligned 
on the split side of the formation. When scenario occurs the defense will normally 
employ a stack alignment behind a weakside 4 and 5 technique tackle if there is no 
weakside tight end. The stack alignment may be a loose stack alignment or a 
vertical stack alignment. 
The level blocking technique results in the offensive tackle moving on an upfield 
plane through the first two levels. The level blocking tackle’s assignment is to cut- 
off the pursuit of any defender who attempts to cross his face. It is important that

the tackle step to a point between the set-to-reach landmark and the set-to-drive 
landmark so that he can use only the outside half of his body to block the defender 
in his path. Ideally, the tackle wants to use his outside shoulder and flipper to slam 
the inside portion of the down defender before proceeding into the second level. 
The tackle’s objective is to disrupt the pursuit of the defensive tackle and force him 
to go behind the block. Keeping the shoulders square as he moves upfield, the 
offensive tackle should immediately begin to search for the outside backer. The 
outside backer will likely hang for a moment before he begins to shuffle inside to 
check cutback. This momentary hang and shuffle action gives the level blocking 
tackle an opportunity to rip up through the defensive tackle’s inside shoulder and 
move up through the second level to cut-off the pursuit of the linebacker.

The level block is usually a fun block for the offensive tackle. If he executes the 
technique properly, he can be credited with blocking two defenders on one play. The 
level block is a particularly effective block on cutback plays. By moving up to the 
second level to wall out the outside linebacker, the offensive tackle can provide the 
touchdown breaking block on an inside cutback. It is the outside linebacker who 
normally is responsible for stopping the cutback.

Diagram 4-14: The level block can break the cutback lane open. 
One of the most important points of emphasis of the level block technique should 
be the necessity of the offensive tackle chopping his feet and widening his base as 
he enters the second level. By cutting his stride length and widening his feet, the 
blocker postures himself in the proper run-blocking demeanor to wall out the 
shuffling outside backer. The choppy footwork and the wide base also help to 
ensure the timing of the tackle’s arrival at the junction point. Once the tackle 
reaches the junction point, he should execute a high “run through” block as he drives 
his outside shoulder pad into the chest of the outside linebacker. 
An effective level blocking technique involves the following prescribed coaching 
points: 
e 
Taking the appropriate set to level block. 
e 
Keeping the shoulders square at all times. 
¢ 
Chopping the feet and widening the base when moving into the second level. 
e 
Preventing any defender from crossing the blocker’s face. 

FAN BLOCK 
A fan block is an angle block toward the outside (i.e., away from the center). In this 
type of block, the blocker attacks the near hip of the defender. All factors 
considered, the fan block is one of the easier blocks to execute. This ease occurs 
because of the natural leverage angle created by the defender’s alignment and the 
defender’s relative position to the hole through which the ball carrier runs. When 
executing a fan block, the blocker must address the fact that a down defender will 
demonstrate one of two techniques. He may be either a penetrator—a defender 
who attacks the line of scrimmage on the snap or a reader—a defender who sits on 
the line of scrimmage and reacts to the blocking scheme. 
In order to fan block a penetrator, the offensive lineman should pay close attention 
to his mechanics in maintaining the proper run-blocking demeanor. His feet should be 
slightly wider than his shoulders, and he should use his hands to punch, extend, and 
grab cloth on the chest of the defender. He must keep his shoulders on a lower 
plane than the defender’s shoulders. His elbows should stay close to the body so 
that he may cement the fit into the defender. It is particularly important that the 
fan blocker keep his face up so that he doesn’t become top-heavy in the block. 
Balance Is one of the critical keys to executing an effective fan block. 
On a fan block, the inside arm of the blocker is the dominant leverage arm. The fan 
blocker's inside arm fulfills the same role as the outside arm of the down blocker. 
Since both the fan block and the down block are angle blocks, the techniques are 
mirrored techniques. What the outside arm is for the down blocker is comparable to 
what the inside arm is for the fan blocker. 
The fan blocker should drive his inside hand up through the near armpit of the 
defender. By punching to the armpit, the inside arm forces the inside pad of the 
defender to elevate. When one shoulder of a defender elevates, he becomes off 
balance and is easily toppled. Since the inside pad of the outside shade technique is 
his attack pad, driving the defender’s inside shoulder upward removes his leverage. 
The outside hand of the fan blocker punches to the inside number of the defender. 
The fan blocker should use his hand to grab cloth and control the defender. 
Extending the outside arm into the defender produces a lateral thrust. This thrust 
actually helps to facilitate the outward push of the blocker against the defender, 
thereby widening the hole. The outside arm also functions as a mechanism to allow 
the blocker to feel the pressure of the defender. 
Feeling the pressure of the defender cues the blocker to redirect his momentum and 
maintain contact. The inside arm provides the lift and forces an imbalance of the 
defender’s posture; the outside arm assists in knocking the defender outward and 
helps to cement the fit.

The wider the alignment of the defender, the flatter the attack angle the blocker 
should take. The placement of the set-to-drive step is dependent upon the 
defender’s width and depth from the line of scrimmage. Staying on line to the 
defender’s near hip is especially important for the success of the fan block. Firing 
out on too flat of an angle usually results in the defender easily ripping his outside 
shoulder across the face of the blocker. Firing out on too sharp of an angle usually 
results in the defender running behind the block to easily make the play. The fan 
block technique is particularly sensitive to the blocker making the proper set-to- 
drive and attack step. 
The components of an effective fan block include the following factors: 
e 
A proper set-to-drive step. 
e 
Aproper attack step. 
e 
Keeping the eyes and hands on target. 
e 
Maintaining a proper run-blocking demeanor. 
e

unorthodox. It is, however, an effective technique to use against a backside

defender who attempts to “olay” behind the inside zone blocker. Similar to the level 
blocking technique, the butt block is only used by the offensive tackle against a 50 
defensive front structure. The tackle should not use the butt block unless he is sure 
that a defensive lineman aligned on the backside guard is accounted for by a 
teammate. If the defensive lineman aligned on the guard is accounted for by rule, 
Hs 
backside tackle can freely use the butt block technique when he steps to reach 
playside.

The butt blocking tackle uses his buttocks as the primary blocking surface. To use 
the butt blocking technique, the tackle.sets to reach inside but plants and backs up 
into the playing defender. (The defender can be using an olay technique or simply 
attempting to run around the block as he dips behind the tackle’s butt) When 
backing into the defender, the tackle will swing his backside arm as a large wing 
and hook the defender with his elbow. The finish position of the butt block involves 
a situation where the blocker is facing upfield and the defender is facing the 
backfield. They fit together closely at the hip—the tackle’s outside hip to the 
defender’s inside hip. To secure this hip-to-hip position, the tackle uses his outside 
arm to swing backward and pinch the defender between the back of his upper arm 
and his ribs. The tackle must then continue to shuffle his feet backward to maintain 
the fit which is secured by his outside arm.

ESCAPE MOVES (OLAY AND RIP) 
Two basic inside moves are used to clear a defender. These moves are closely linked 
to the influence block, since they are both escape mechanisms for a blocker to slip 
underneath a defensive lineman and thus create an inside crease for a trapper 
coming from the offside. 
The first inside move to consider is the olay move. The term “olay” is a common 
term for a move used on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. It refers 
to a quick overhead swimming motion by the arm opposite the direction in which the 
player is going. On offense, the olay technique is normally used as an escape move 
to the inside. It is more commonly used by a tight end when escaping the clutches of 
the defensive end to release into a pass pattern. The tight end uses the olay 
technique to escape both to the outside and inside. For an offensive guard, the olay 
is an effective move to get to the inside and clear the trap bait. 
To olay, the guard must quickly swim the outside hand over the head of the 
defender. The olay move is made easier by the guard setting to drive (or pass 
setting the defender) and immediately slapping the defender with the inside hand. 
The guard then drives the outside leg across the defender and swims the outside 
hand over the top. The outside hip must quickly follow the outside foot as the guard 
crosses the defender’s face. The olay is extremely effective in creating a crease for 
the trapper to exploit. 
The rip move is the more common escape move. As such, it offers its own unique 
advantage. First, the rip move is a slightly quicker escape move. The offensive 
lineman pushes hard off the outside foot and steps to a 45-degree angle inside with 
the inside foot. He rips his outside arm across the defender in an uppercut fashion as 
he dips his outside shoulder.

Dipping the outside shoulder decreases the available surface area that the 
defensive lineman can use as leverage. The defensive lineman is trained to shoot his 
hands inside to the chest of the blocker. When the blocker’s outside shoulder dips 
and twists across the defender, the defender has no surface to strike with his 
outside hand. A defensive lineman—even a well-coached one—tends to respond to 
the blocker’s lowered shoulder by placing his outside hand on the back of the 
blockers shoulder. The act of the defender placing his hand on the back of the 
blocker’s shoulder actually assists the ripping blocker in gaining clearance to the 
inside. The defender will normally push against the back of the blocker’s shoulder, 
thereby aiding him in crossing the blocker’s face. Defensive coaches often work hard 
on training the defensive linemen to keep their outside hand low—under the ripping 
blocker’s outside shoulder. 
The blocker uses his outside arm to drive across the defender’s body and to break 
free to the inside. Once the second step is completed, the ripping blocker will work 
upfield with his shoulders square. According to his assignment, the escaping blocker 
will work up through the second level to seal a linebacker or combo-off a3 
technique. 
When a defensive lineman is aligned on an inside teammate, the ripping offensive 
lineman should use a glide step in finishing his escape (the reader should refer to the 
section on glide stepping for more details). When no defensive lineman is positioned 
on the offensive lineman to the inside, the ripping lineman will take a more angular 
first step (i.e., flatter down the line of scrimmage). Stepping flatter into the line of 
scrimmage allows the ripping lineman to gain more clearance from the baited 
defensive lineman.

A blocker who uses either an olay move or atip move should focus on achieving the 
following objectives: 
¢ 
Clearing the defender with the outside hip snapping across the defender. 
¢ 
Taking the appropriate inside step to accomplish the secondary objective. 
¢ 
Quickly swimming over or ripping under the outside arm. 
* 
Taking a good split so that the defender can’t jam him inside.

ARC RELEASE 
The arc release is a block used by the tight end to escape the defensive end and to 
release outside to block a second- or third-level defender. The arc release is also 
used by the tight end to get a wide release and to run a vertical pass route into the 
seam of the secondary. 
To execute an arc release, the tight end executes a sweep pull technique to the 
outside. The bucket step of the outside foot creates distance from the line of 
scrimmage. Unlike the drop step type of bucket step by a loop blocker in the fold 
blocking combination, the arc-release bucket step includes a pivot and push off of 
the inside foot to gain width. The cushion created by the bucket step prevents the 
defensive end from getting his hands on the tight end. Adequate depth also allows 
the arc-releasing tight end to read the action of the secondary force. Once the 
depth is gained, the tight end squares his shoulders and looks upfield.

Used primarily with option attacks, the arc release gets the tight end to the 
defensive flank with a desirable degree of timing. As a blocker, the arc-releasing 
tight end’s normal role is to work upfield to position himself so that he may hook the 
force defender. (The force defender is the secondary defender who is responsible 
for turning the ball carrier inside to the defensive pursuit.)

BLOCK RELEASE 
An escape mechanism used exclusively by the tight end, the block release allows 
the tight end to attack the defensive end, then use his leverage to release cleanly 
into the pass pattern. The block releasing tight end slams his shoulder into the 
defender. The tight end’s head is kept to the side of the desired release. For an 
outside block release, the end slams the defender with his inside shoulder. Once the 
blow is delivered, the end quickly disengages and releases into the pattern. A key 
coaching point of the block release is the tight end’s leverage on the defender. The 
tight end must strike the blow from the hips and hit upward through the defender.

ALLEY BLOCK 
The alley block is a backside cut-off block that is carried up through the third level. 
Once a cut-off blocker has worked upfield to cut-off the pursuit of the first and 
second level defenders, the cut-off blocker turns to sprint to the sideline. The width 
to which he sprints is dependent upon the width of the play called. If the play is a 
wide play (such as a sweep), the alley blocker will sprint further across the field 
because the alley will be wider. When the alley is wide, the alley blocker should 
sprint across the field at a depth of approximately seven yards deep. He will 
intercept the alley just as the ball carrier hits the alley with his shoulders square. If 
the play is an off-tackle play, the alley will be tighter. When the alley is tight to the 
ball, the alley blocker will angle further upfield to enter the alley approximately 10 
to 15 yards downfield. 
7-9 yards 
9-10 yards 

The primary objective of the alley blocker is to enter the alley on a near- 
perpendicular path to the ball carrier and blindside a third-level tackler. The most 
common recipient of an alley block is the free safety. A free safety usually 
attempts to fill the alley and make the hit on the ball carrier. In filling the alley, the 
free safety intently focuses on the ball carrier. The alley blocker will get a blindside 
shot on the free safety as he attacks from the inside. The alley blocker should make 
sure that the momentum of his block is delivered from a position that is forward of 
the free safety, thereby avoiding the possibility of a illegal block in the back. 
Backside linemen who hustle and master the alley blocking technique will often 
help facilitate a situation where a long rushing play is broken into a touchdown 
rushing play. 
Diagram 4-27: The alley block blindsides the free safety in the alley. 
The free safety is often unaccounted for by the blocking scheme. By utilizing your 
offensive linemen in this manner, you can provide a means of accounting for the free 
safety. The alley block can be performed by any backside blocking technique who 
eventually works his way through the second level. The alley block can be 
performed off of the inside zone or the fold block.

REACH (HOOK) BLOCK 
The reach block (i.e., hook block) is by definition an onside blocking technique. It is 
technically the outside portion of the outside zone block described in Chapter 9. To 
perform a reach block, the onside offensive lineman should set to reach. Setting to 
reach involves the blocker pushing off his inside foot and taking a set-to-reach step 
with his outside foot. The second step is made through the crotch of the defender 
as the blocker rips his inside arm across the defender’s chest. The blocker can use 
his inside arm to rip with the flipper and secure the fit against the defender. The 
reach blocker’s objective is to initially overtake the defender in width. The reach 
blocker can then ride the outside shoulder of the defender as he works up to the 
next level. 
The reach blocker should use his flipper to push against the defender and prevent 
the defender from grabbing the blocker and pulling him to the ground. Lateral 
movement with outside leverage Is integral to a successful reach block. 
The reach block is the mirrored blocking technique of the inside zone blocking 
combination “zone” call. Both blocks are J blocks that are characterized by the 
blocker flattening his path to junction the defender’s pursuit.
