# Fundamental Concepts for Offensive Line Play

Fundamental Concepts for Offensive Line Play 
In any offensive line system, certain fundamental concepts must be established. 
Different systems may vary in the designation of these concepts, but every system 
must include the following elements: hole numbering; gap lettering; and defensive 
alignments. 
HOLE NUMBERING 
The term “hole numbering” refers to the identification of a particular area through 
where the ball carrier will run. Most offensive coaches number the holes for 
identification. The common method of numbering the holes assigns numerical values 
to the offensive line positions. In this method, the values of the numbers increase as 
you’count outward from the center. The center's right leg is assigned the number 0, 
and his left leg is assigned the number 1. Counting outward from the center's right 
leg, the number 2 is assigned to the right hip of the guard, the number 4 is assigned 
to the right hip of the tackle, and the number 6 is assigned to the right hip of the 
end. The number 8 identifies the wide hole (i.¢., the area between the imaginary 
fourth man on the line of scrimmage and the sideline). Counting outward from the 
center's left leg, the number 3 corresponds to the left hip of the guard, the number 
5 corresponds to the left hip of the tackle, the number 7 corresponds to the left hip 
of the end, and the number 9 corresponds to the wide hole. Diagram 2-1 illustrates 
such a numbering system.

Several different hole numbering philosophies are available to the offensive coach. 
A number of coaches number the holes in a reverse manner. These coaches use a 
system that counts inward, starting with the wide hole and stopping with the near 
leg of the center. In this numbering system, the number 8 is assigned to the right leg 
of the center; the number 9 is assigned to the left leg of the center. This system is 
believed to be useful when calling audibles. Since the most common numbering 
system assigns the lower values to the center, the reverse system prevents an 
audible from being deciphered by the defense. This type of numbering system Is 
shown in Diagram 2-2.

A third numbering system is the right-to-left concept. The right-to-left numbering 
concept is a system in which the numbers increase in value from right to left. In this 
system, the wide hole on the right side of the ball is number 1. The number 2 
corresponds to the outside hip of the right end, the number 3 corresponds to the 
outside hip of the right tackle, the number 4 corresponds to the outside hip of the 
right guard, the number 5 corresponds to the tailbone of the center, the number 6 
corresponds to the outside hip of the left guard, the number 7 corresponds to the 
outside hip of the left tackle, the number 9 corresponds to the outside hip of the 
left end, and the number 0 corresponds to the wide hole on the left side of the ball. 
Numbering the holes consecutively from right to left is rarely used, even though it is 
probably the oldest numbering system in use. Since the right-to-left system is 
rarely used, it is also a good system to use if you are concerned about the security 
of your audibles. Diagram 2-3 shows the right-to-left system.

Diagram 2-3: The right-to-left numbering system. 
The hole numbering philosophy is sometimes linked to the structural philosophy of 
the formation alignment. In the flip-flop system discussed in Chapter 14, the hole 
numbers can flip with the player, although all factors considered, | personally prefer 
that the numbers stay the same—right and left—regardless of whether a flip-flop 
system is employed. In a system where the hole numbers switch according to a 
formation strength call, a strong tackle will carry the number 4 hole with him when 
he flips from side to side. In other words, the even-numbered holes flip with the 
strong side lineman and the odd-numbered holes flip with the weak side lineman. 
Diagrams 2-4 and 2-5 illustrate the concept of the numbered holes flip-flopping 
with the offensive strength call.

right formation.

The same-side philosophy of alignment keeps the numbered holes in static 
positions. The numbers remain in the same location in every formation. Diagrams 2-6 
and 2-7 illustrate this concept. 
A relatively small number of offensive coaches don’t employ a hole numbering 
system. These coaches teach their plays without reference to a specific hole 
identification system, teaching landmarks that identify the aiming points with 
phrases such as “hip of the tackle,” “leg of the guard,” etc.

regardless whether a pro right formation is called.

GAP LETTERING 
Gaps refer to the area between adjacent offensive linemen. Generally, the gaps are 
labeled with letters. Each center-guard gap is called an “A” gap. Each guard-tackle 
gap is called a “B” gap. Each tackle-end gap is called a “C” gap. The area 
corresponding to the wide hole is called the “D” gap. A particular gap Is identified by 
designating it an onside or offside gap. The prefix onside is attached to the letter of 
the gap when the ball is moving toward the side of that gap. For example, the right 
“A” gap is the “onside ‘A’ gap” when the play is designed to hit over the right side. 
On such a right-handed play, the left “A” gap is the “offside ‘A’ gap.” Diagram 2-8 
shows how gaps are assigned basic letters.

IDENTIFYING DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT TECHNIQUES 
The alignments of the defensive front are identified by recognizing the individual 
alignment techniques of the defensive linemen. Several different concepts are used 
to designate the alignment of the defensive linemen throughout the many levels of 
play. One of the best concepts for identifying the defensive front alignments is 
shown in Diagram 2-9.

Diagram 2-9: Defensive line techniques. 
Chart 2-1details the parameters of each defensive line technique shown in Diagram 
2-9. It is extremely important that your offensive linemen not only be able to 
recognize and verbally identify defensive technique alignments, but be able to 
explain the responsibility of that particular defensive technique . 
In the defensive technique numbering model shown in Diagram 2-9, an even- 
numbered technique corresponds to a headup technique. Outside shades are odd- 
numbered techniques. The 7 technique is the one exception to the outside shade 
technique correlating to the odd-numbered technique. The 7 technique is the only 
inside shade technique identified by an odd number. The remaining inside shades are 
specified by even numbers. An even-numbered technique also corresponds to a 
headup technique. 
The letter “i” is used to specify when the even-numbered technique is an inside 
shade and not a headup alignment. For example, the inside shade alignment on the 
offensive guard is called a “2i” technique. An inside shade alignment on the 
offensive tackle is called a “4i” technique. Another quirk of the classical numbering 
system is realized when you attempt to identify a gap technique.

With one exception, no identifying number for a gap alignment exists in the classical 
system. In order to identify a defender as a gap alignment technique, you must add 
the word “gap” after the technique number. For example, when a defender aligns in 
the gap between the guard and tackle, he is said to align in a “4 gap.” You could also 
accurately describe that particular gap alignment as a “3 gap.” The designation of a 
defender aligned in the guard-tackle gap as either a “4 gap” or a “3 gap” is a matter 
of preference. A defender who aligns in the gap between the offensive tackle and 
the tight end may also be designated by one of two names. The defender aligned in 
tackle-tight end gap can be called a5 gap” or a “7 gap.” The choice of which name 
is best is one of personal preference. The classic numbering system calls the 
defender who is aligned in the center-guard gap a 1 technique. 
IDENTIFYING DEFENSIVE FRONTS 
Defensive fronts are classified as either seven-man or eight-man fronts. An 
alternate method of classifying fronts is according to their structure. Three 
different front structures include all of the standard defensive fronts—even 
structures; odd structures; and goal line structures. Five basic defensive fronts fall 
under the category of even-structured defense; the odd-structured defensive 
classification encompasses four basic defensive fronts; and six basic defensive 
fronts are included in the category of goal line structured defense. Chart 2-2 shows 

the basic defensive fronts and the category to which they belong. Diagrams 2-10 
through 2-24 illustrate each front.
