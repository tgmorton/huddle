# Goal Line Blocking

---

Goal Line Blocking 
Once an offensive unit penetrates its opponent's ten yard line—especially inside the 
five yard line, it may be faced with a defensive scheme characterized by an interior 
line charge and aggressive play from the secondary. The closer the ball gets to a 
defensive unit's goal line, the more aggressive the defensive play, particularly from 
the secondary personnel. With less area to cover, the secondary will be able to play 
underneath the receiver (i.e., between the receiver and the quarterback). Most 
defensive secondary personnel know that the end line of the end zone functions as 
an extra defender. 
Defensive goal line fronts normally use an “eleven man” in-the-box scheme. Four of 
the more popular goal line fronts are the 6-5 goal line front, the 7-1 front, the 5-3 
front and the gap-8 front. These pressure fronts are normally used when the ball 
penetrates the defender’s five-yard line. Another common characteristic of the 
inside-the-five, situational goal line defense is a man-to-man scheme coverage 
scheme. 
Diagram 10-1: 65. (The 62 alignment is a very popular defensive scheme that becomes 
the 65 when the secondary moves up.) 

Diagram 10-2: 7-1. (The 7-1is a variation of the old Chicago Bear's 46 defensive 
alignment.)

Diagram 10-4: Gap 8. (In goal line situations, two defensive linemen (B's) are normally 
substituted from one linebacker and one defensive back.) 
Goal line blocking presents a unique problem for an offensive line in that the 
defensive line will concentrate on penetrating into the backfield. Defensive line 
defenders on the goal line will normally get in a “nose to the turf” stance with their 
elbows bent. They will typically key the ball and charge through their assigned gap 
on the snap of the football. Perimeter defenders (.e., strong safeties and 
cornerbacks) will contain by charging up the field. 
To block goal line defenders, offensive linemen should utilize their own goal line 
stance. When facing a definite goal line charge by the defensive front, offensive 
linemen should use a four-point stance. A good four-point offensive goal line stance 
is a characterized by the following components: 
© 
Weight forward. 
e 
Feet balanced under the hips. 
e 
Hands slightly forward of the shoulders. 
© 
Heels slightly off the turf. 
e 
Elbows bent. 
e 
Head up and neck bowed. 
Against a penetrating style of defense, the landmarks of the various blocks are 
slightly exaggerated. The set to drive landmark is approximately four inches below 
the normal blocking plane. The set to reach landmark is extended to the far elbow 
of the defender. When setting to reach, the blocker should attempt to get his 
facemask through the far elbow of the defender. The blocker can exaggerate his set 
to reach step because the nature of the goal line defense is a penetrating nature. 

Penetrating defensive linemen will not attempt to fight across the face of angle 
blockers. Therefore, under normal circumstances against a goal line front, offensive 
linemen should not worry about the defender playing underneath the exaggerated 
set to reach. 
Because a full line slant can open up running lanes between the ends, few defensive 
coaches run a full line slant from a goal line look. While some defensive coaches 
slant their front on the goal line, in reality, the probability of a full goal line front 
slant is decreased as the ball moves closer to the goal line. If the scouting report 
shows a probability of a full line slant, the offensive linemen should be taught not 
to extend to the set to reach landmark. Against a slanting front, the offensive line 
should keep anormal set to reach landmark and should aim to the opposite 
breastplate of the defender. 
If the blocker does get to the far elbow on the set to reach, he is ina position to 
“get around” on the defender and to work his shoulders upfield in a cutoff 
technique. When reaching a penetrating defender, it is important for the blocker to 
get his backside shoulder across the defender’s face and to work his frontside 
shoulder upfield. Getting the shoulders square and scrambling into a vertical 
blocking position are key factors in the success of a cutoff or a reach block against 
a penetrating defender. 
Generally, two-man combination blocks do not work well against a goal line 
penetrating defense. With the defense working to stay low and to get penetration 
into the backfield, combination blocks become relatively difficult to execute. The 
hip-to-hip seal that is crucial to the success of a two-man zone block is hard to 
maintain against a penetrating defender. Likewise, fold blocks are not normally 
effective strategies against a penetrating front. 
A few combinations are effective against the various goal line fronts. One of these 
combinations Is an over scheme. An over scheme enables the center toreach a 
charging 1 technique as the guard drives through the outside shoulder of the 1 
technique, to seal the middle linebacker. Diagram 10-5 shows an over scheme 
against a 6-5 goal line front. Despite the fact that a 6-5 goal line front is designed to 
free the middle linebacker, an over scheme can account for the 6-5 middle 
linebacker. 
Another effective blocking scheme on the goal line is gap blocking. Onside gap 
blocking can seal the defensive penetration and isolate the end defender for a kick- 
out block by a blocking back or the backside guard. The gap scheme calls for the 
playside offensive linemen to use a down blocking technique, while the center 
blocks the playside “A” gap. Diagram 10-6 shows an onside gap blocking scheme 
versus the gap 8 goal line front. A gap scheme is a good scheme to use when running 
off tackle or outside the end.

factors considered, | have found this goal line play to be very effective.) 
A wedge blocking scheme is another effective goal line blocking scheme versus 
both the 6-5 front and the gap 8 front. A wedge blocking scheme calls for the 
playside blockers to fire off the ball shoulder-to-shoulder and to get a vertical push 
against the defenders positioned inside the playside tight end.

One of the more neglected areas of offensive preparation is the goal line offense 
package. When it is adequately addressed, the goal line attack is often practiced as 
an incidental part of the practice moments before a break, or 
just before the end of 
practice. Many offensive coordinators tend to direct the focus of the goal line 
period to the big picture. In the process, they don't allow enough time for 
individualized practice of goal line blocking techniques. It is important that you not 
only take the time to walk through the goal line blocking assignments, but 
concentrate your teaching efforts and plan a concise goal line package which 
provides you an opportunity to attack either defensive flank and exploit any 
defensive conflict. 
Adequate preparation of the goal line phase can mean the difference between a 
championship and a back-in-the-pack finish. An old football saying warns that it is 
the little things that can mean the difference between winning and losing. If little 
things can mean the difference between winning and losing, then consider the 
possible effects of neglecting the big things—such as goal line offense preparation.
