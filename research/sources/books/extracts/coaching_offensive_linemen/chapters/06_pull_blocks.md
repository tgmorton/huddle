Pull Blocks 
The third primary category of offensive line run blocks is the pull block. Pull blocks 
are characterized as techniques executed by a lineman pulling to either side. A list 
of the various types of pull blocks includes the following:

SWEEP HAMMER PULL 
The sweep pull may be a short or a long pull. Short sweep pulls are pulls from the 
onside of the ball out toward the defensive flank. Long sweep pulls are pulls from 
the offside of the ball across the center to the playside. Sweep pulls are called “log 
blocks” or “wall blocks” when the pulling guard or tackle uses his inside shoulder to 
seal the defensive end inside. Sweep pulls are called “kick-out blocks” or “hammer 
blocks” when the pulling guard or tackle attacks the defender from an inside-out 
position. The hammer block—a specialized type of kick-out block used with the 
Wing-T—was developed for single wing football and is still an effective method of 
creating the alley crease on the buck sweep series. 
Sweep pulls differ from trap pulls in several ways. The biggest difference between 
a sweep pull and a trap pull is the angle of attack. The sweep pulling lineman gains 
depth on his pull, while the trap pulling lineman attacks ona 
flatter path into the 
line of scrimmage. The sweep pull can be either a log block or a kick-out block, 
whereas a trap pull is designed solely to be a kick-out block. The sweep pull is made 
off of a deeper pivot and a bucket step, while the trap pull is normally made of a 
sharp push flat down the line of scrimmage. Finally, the sweep pull is characterized 
by the blocker snapping his playside elbow around so that the hand can slap his 
buttocks while the trap pull is characterized by the pivot and handshake move of 
the blocker's lead hand. 
“ The initial movements for both the short sweep log and kick-out blocks are 
identical. Only the finishing movements are different. The short sweep pulling guard 
begins with a hard push off the inside foot as he simultaneously rotates the toes

inward. Rotating the toes of the push foot inward allows the hips to open to 90 
degrees or more. When pulling right, the left foot is the push foot. The right foot is 
yanked backward as the right elbow is jerked backward and to the left.

Diagram 6-3: A short sweep hammer block by the right guard. 
Young linemen can be trained to open deeply by having them to attempt to slap their 
left buttock with their right hand. This movement snaps their shoulders around and 
forces the hip to open. The right foot is also forced to bucket step, a key coaching 
point to sweep pulling. The bucket step forces the guard to pivot approximately 110 
degrees so that he is heading backward to some degree. The second step crosses 
over to apoint where the heel is directly in front of the toes of the bucket foot. The 
inside shoulder dips and the guard gets his eyes to the target area as the bucket 
foot makes the third step and regains a normal base. On the fourth step, made with 
the inside foot, the guard gets his shoulders back to parallel with the line of 
scrimmage. At the point of the fourth step, the hammer pulling guard and the log 
pulling guard should be approximately two and one-half yards behind the line of 
scrimmage. The sweep blockers gain depth for two reasons: first, they want to 
clear any wreckage which may be caused by a penetrating defender through an 
outside gap; second, they want to gain depth so that they can hit the line of 
scrimmage with their shoulders parallel to the line of scrimmage while they read 
the edges of the alley. 
It is on the fifth step that the short sweep pulling guard's technique begins to take 
the identifying characteristic of being either a wall or a kick-out block. The log 
blocker will tighten his path into the neutral zone to fit tightly to the outside hip of 
the seal blocker.

Diagram 6-6: A short sweep wall (i.e., log) block by the right guard—fitting to the 
outside hip of the seal blocker. 
It is between the fourth and fifth step that the hammer blocker analyzes the action 
of the force. The fifth step is made straight ahead as the guard reads the relative 
positioning of the force. If the force is coming hard, the offensive guard plants the 
inside foot at a 45-degree step, thereby keeping the toe forward. The sixth step is a 
45-degree plant step called the hammer step. The seventh step is made with the 
outside foot off of the 45-degree hammer step. The outside foot is a 90-degree 
step to a point where the guard may meet the upfield shoulder of the force 
defender. The inside foot then follows, and the guard moves along a plane which is 
parallel to the line of scrimmage. 
He then moves outward and widens his base to contact the force with what had 
been his outside shoulder. A hammer block on the right side is made with the right 
shoulder. The head of the guard should ideally be positioned slightly behind the 
force defender. This head positioning makes the defender run around the hammer 
block to make the play. By the time he is able to run around the block, the ball 
carrier has hit the crease of the alley.

Diagram 6-7: A short sweep hammer block by the right guard. 
The kick-out block technique off of the short pull is very different from the hammer 
pull. As described in the previous paragraph, for the first four to five steps, the 
hammer blocking guard pulls on the same track as the wall blocking guard. The kick- 
out technique pulling guard departs from this path on his second step. Obtaining 
depth and tracking ona 
vertical charge toward the line of scrimmage are key 
coaching points of the wall and the hammer blocks. 
The kick-out blocker doesn’t gain significant depth off the line of scrimmage when 
pulling. His angle is near that of along trapper. He keeps his shoulders facing the 
sideline as he moves to kick-out the hard charging force. On contact with the force 
defender, the kick-out sweep pulling technique is identical to that of the trap pulling 
contact. If the kick-out blocker is sweep pulling to the right, he should contact the 
force defender with his right shoulder. If the kick-out blocker is sweep pulling to the 
left, he should contact the force defender with his left shoulder. 
The long sweep pull starts out like a long trap. It normally is used as a wall blocking 
technique. The initial step is a flat step off of a push with the outside foot. The 
guard's shoulders face a plane parallel to the line of scrimmage as he passes 
between the quarterback and the center. The split of the guard should be wide 
enough to allow him to clear the center as he makes his third step. 
A tight split alters the timing of the pull, as well as presents a potential threat for 
causing a fumble. Guards who take too tight a split may hit the ball on the 
handshake opening of the long trap technique. They sometimes cause a fumble as 
they hit the ball before the quarterback can properly seat the ball. Once the guard

clears the center on his third step, he crosses over and gains depth. The crossover is 
sometimes called the “Heisman pull” because the movement resembles the Heisman 
trophy pose. Depth is gained to approximately two yards behind the line of 
scrimmage. 
The backside wall pulling blocker will then attack the outside hip of the blocker 
assigned to seal the edge of the defense. The landmark of the backside wall pulling 
is the outside hip of the seal blocker. The backside guard should keep his eyes inside 
as he looks for leakage between the tackles. Once he hits the landmark with his 
shoulders Square, he uses his inside shoulder pad to drive through any defender’s 
outside shoulder. With proper technique, the backside guard may seal one, two, or 
even three defenders as he continues on the proper path. 
Diagram 6-8: A long sweep wall block by the backside guard. 
Similar to the onside short sweep pull, the long sweep pull from the backside is also 
used as a play pass protection in the bootleg/waggle scheme. Some run and waggle 
blocking schemes require both the onside and the backside pulling guards to read 
the defensive flow on the perimeter. In this case, the long pulling wall guard from 
the backside could transform into the hammer blocker if the frontside short pulling 
guard chooses to wall off the edge. Additional details on the reading sweep pulling 
technique are provided in the discussion of the bootleg/waggle scheme later in this 
chapter. 
Previously, the sweep pulls were discussed solely with regard to the guards pulling. 
In reality, however, tackles and even centers can sweep pull. These positions pull 
sometimes as an alternative scheme when one or both of the guards are facing a 

defensive linemen. While an uncommon tactic, the backside tackle has been known 
to provide an effective wall block as a backside waggle/bootleg blocker. Likewise, 
some offensive schemes have made effective use of pulling the uncovered center as 
a wall blocker on the sweep. In addition, the playside tackle is an extremely 
effective lead blocker when using either the hammer or the kick-out short pulling 
technique on quick toss plays.

TRAP PULL 
The trap pull is one of two basic types of pulling techniques. The other type is the 
sweep pull. The term “trap pull” is normally used to describe a trap pull from the 
offside to the onside. However, a trap pull technique is also used as an onside trap 
pull known as a G-block.

A trap pulling lineman pushes off hard on his push foot. When pulling to trap across 
the ball, the offensive lineman can use his down hand to help push with his outside 
foot. This pushing action forces the trapper’s hips to open in what is called the pivot 
stage of the trap pull. During the pivot, the trapper should jerk his inside elbow 
backward so that his lead hand opens to the path he is about to take. 
The opening of the hand to the trapping path is called the handshake move, because 
the finish of the move results in the lead hand being in the position of a handshake 
being offered. The length of the trap influences the depth to which the lead 
shoulder should be opened. For a longer trap, the inside elbow should snap 
backward in a manner closer to a sweep pull technique. Snapping the elbow further 
back opens the shoulder to a greater degree, thereby resulting in the trapper being 
in a position to better track flat down the line of scrimmage. To track sharper into 
the line of scrimmage on a short trap, the lineman should offer a sharper handshake 
(i.e., pointing his fingers into the line of scrimmage). 
The track of the inside foot off of the initial pivot-push starting sequence should be 
on the same angle as the point of the handshake. The footwork of any trap is the 
pivot-push footwork. The blocker uses the handshake to facilitate the opening of 
the hips and the pivot. The inside foot plants near the desired track as the outside 
foot pivots to turn the backside knee inside. The outside foot then pushes hard 
against the turf to propel the trapper on the track. The outside foot pivots, then 
pushes to track the blocker on his trapping angle. 
While offensive guards most commonly function as trappers, tight ends and tackles 
also trap. Guards run long and short traps. Tackles run only long traps. Tight ends 
normally trap off of a formation shift and motion across the center—an action that 
makes them primarily a short trapper. The length of a trap is significant because it 
determines the angle of the trapper’s track to the defender. Short trappers run 
short-angles off a sharp handshake move. Long trappers run a flatter angle. In fact, 
long trappers should run their track on a parallel plane to the line of scrimmage. A 
long trapper should run on his flat track until he clears the center. As he passes the 
playside leg of the center, the trapper should immediately begin angling inward to 
kick-out the defender. 
The two-fold cardinal rule of trap pulling is: “pull left—hit left; pull right—hit right.” 
While several extended coaching points can be included in coaching the trapper, the 
cardinal rule explains trapping in a clear and concise way to players of all levels. 
The rule has a straightforward meaning to offensive linemen. When pulling to the 
right, the trap pulling lineman must contact the targeted defender with his right 
shoulder. When pulling to the left, the trap pulling lineman must contact the 
targeted defender with his left shoulder. \f a lineman adheres to the trap rule when 
he pulls, he is guaranteed to be on the correct trapping path. He will always be on 
the kick-out angle.

Unfortunately many coaches “over-coach” the trapper. These coaches often require 
the trapper to read the action of the defender. If the defender closes down the line 
of scrimmage to stuff the trapper, the pulling lineman can simply convert his trap 
technique to a log technique and seal the defender inside. The ball carrier is trained 
to read the log and skip off the butt of the log blocking lineman. The term “over- 
coach" is not necessarily a derogative reference with regard to this coaching 
technique. It simply refers to the degree of extended teaching that can be 
attempted in coaching the trap. Many offensive schemes require “over-coaching” 
the trap as an integral part of the scheme. For an offensive system such as the 
Wing-T, the trap must be a series that cannot be stopped. Accordingly, the Wing-T 
offensive line coach is well-advised to spend as much time as possible coaching the 
various elements of the trap pull. 
On the other hand, some offensive line coaches feel that the over-coaching of the 
trap leads to poor trap angles by the blocker. In this situation, the blocker becomes 
tentative and gets caught between the sharp trap angle and the rounded finish of 
the log block. These coaches feel that you can eliminate the problem of a defensive 
lineman closing down and spilling the trap if you call the trap at the proper time, 
thereby setting the defense up during its most vulnerable alignment and game 
situation. 
You should remember that the trap is an opportunistic type of play. It is most 
successful when run on passing downs—when the defense least expects it. Traps 
can keep the dominant defensive lineman honest as you take advantage of his 
aggressiveness. Iraps can hurt the penetrating front that is supported by 
linebackers from a deep alignment. G-blocks are highly effective against defensive 
ends who are outside conscious. Positioning a wingback near a defensive end 
enhances the G-block’s effectiveness, because the defensive end becomes 
extremely alert to the threat of the wingback blocking down on him. 
The G-block is simply an outside trap by the playside guard. The trapping guard 
doesn't cross the center, as on other traps. The G-blocking technique Is a true mirror 
technique of the normal trapping guard's technique: the blocker’s pivot is to the 
outside; his outside hand makes the handshake move; and he pushes off the inside 
foot to track inside out to the defensive end. The G-blocking guard always kicks out 
the first man on or outside the tight end. The defensive end may be set up by a rip 
move of the tight end to the inside, or a combination of a rip move to the inside by 
the tight end and a down block influence by the wingback. 
Offensive linemen don’t use a down block influence move. It is a move used 
exclusively by a wingback. On a down block influence, the wingback baits the 
‘defensive end by driving toward his outside shoulder—faking a down block—and 
then planting off the inside foot to angle outside to kick-out the strong safety.

WAGGLE/BOOTLEG PULL 
The terms waggle and bootleg are essentially synonymous terms for a type of play 
pass lie., pass executed off the fake of a run). The waggle/bootleg involves one or 
two linemen pulling opposite the flow of the backfield. 
A play pass action, the waggle/bootleg is an excellent play and important part of 
any offensive attack, from the full house T formation to the one-back spread 
scheme. On the waggle/bootleg action, the playside is the side opposite the side to 
where the running backs flow. On the waggle/bootleg, the playside guard will short 
sweep pull to gain two to three yards depth and will immediately focus his line of 
sight on a triangular area slicing through the outside hip of the near tackle (refer to 
Diagram 6-15). By throwing his eyes to the tackle’s hip, the guard can immediately 
recognize the action of the man on the tackle. The quick recognition of the 
defender’s reaction enables the guard to take the proper path to log block the 
defender. 
The backside guard pulls flat past the center and gains depth on his third step. The 
backside guard also looks through the triangle. If he recognizes an upfield charge by 
the defensive end, the guard will flatten out and trap block the defensive end. Ona 
trap block, the pulling lineman blocks with the shoulder corresponding to the 
direction of his pull. When pulling to the left, the right guard will trap block using his 
left shoulder to make contact with the defender. This block drives the defender 
outward and allows the quarterback to duck under in the seam between the log of 
the playside guard and the trap of the backside guard (refer to Diagram 6-16).

PULL CHECK 
The backside tackle executes a “pull-check” on the waggle. This term refers to the 
fact that the tackle will pull into the space vacated by the backside pulling guard. If 
no defender is on the guard, the tackle will pull into the space and check the 
linebacker. If the linebacker does not attack the space, then the tackle may peel 
back to the backside to pick up a corner blitz (refer to Diagram 6-17). 
If a defender is aligned on the guard, then the backside tackle will pull hard into the 
space. The tackle will attempt to place his outside shoulder on the inside knee of 
the defender. The technique involves the tackle pushing off his outside foot and 
taking a slight bucket step with his inside foot. This action puts him on an arcing 
path to the inside knee of the defender. If the defender slants inside to the center, 
the tackle should not over commit to the defender. The tackle blocks an area, not a 
man. Once the defender slants to the center, the tackle squares his pads and checks 
for a linebacker. If no linebacker shows, then he may peel back for a corner blitz. See 
Diagram 6-18. 
HORN PULL 
An alternative to a drive block against the inside-shaded defensive tackle is the 
guard horn block. The horn block should be used with off-tackle plays in which the 
guard is drive blocking the linebacker in the 30 front. Normally, this block is a read 
block since the guard makes a presnap read of whether he should pull around the 
horn instead of drive blocking the linebacker. 

Diagram 6-17: The backside tackle pull checks to pick up the blitzing linebacker 
backside on the waggle. 
Diagram 6-18: The backside tackle pull checks and bails out to pick up the outside 
blitz if the inside linebacker doesn't blitz. 
The basis for converting the drive block into a horn pull is the presence of a 41 
technique defensive tackle. A 4i defensive tackle—particularly a gap 41 technique 
tackle—blocks the guard's path to the playside number of the linebacker. When he 
“ reads an off tackle play, the linebacker can easily scrape over the top as the 
defensive tackle occupies two blockers—the guard and tackle. Diagram 6-19a shows 
the 4i technique blocking the offensive guard from getting on the proper track to 
engage the linebacker’s playside number.

Diagram 19a: The 4i technique obstructs the guard's drive blocking angle to the 
linebacker on the off-tackle play. 
Some coaches feel that the outside zone block combination is a better scheme for 
dealing with the 4i technique in a 30 front. However, a combination block—such as 
the outside zone—involves precise execution by two players working as one. The 
horn pull—while a combination in theory—involves only the tackle caving down the 
4i technique, while the guard simply uses his tag technique to step around the horn 
and seal the linebacker. The drive block by the tackle and the horn pull by the guard 
is amuch simpler and easier-to-execute scheme than the outside zone. Additional 
comparative information on the outside zone block (versus a horn pull) is presented 
in Chapter 5. 
An important coaching point for the guard to remember when horn blocking Is to 
keep his shoulders parallel as he steps back to read the flow of the linebacker. He 
can use the tag block technique of stepping back with his inside foot, then driving 
off the tackle’s hip. Additional information on the guard's first step in the tag block 
technique is presented in Chapter 5 in the section on the fold block combination. 
The guard may also execute the horn block by simply stepping laterally off the line 
with his outside foot and reading the linebacker’s flow. With either technique, the 
most important coaching point for the guard is to keep his eyes on the linebacker. 
If the defensive scheme puts the tackle in a 4 technique and plays games— 
sometimes sparking him inside and other times sparking him outside, the horn pull 
can be used as a simple counter measure to the confusion which could be caused by 
the stunts. To counter the games without using the zone blocking schemes, the 

guard may simply step to read the linebacker as the tackle latches on to the 
defender, no matter which direction he stunts. If the 4 technique tackle stunts 
inside, the guard reads the linebacker scraping over the top and pulls around the 
horn to junction him. If the 4 technique tackle stunts outside, the offensive tackle 
pins him, and the guard reads the linebacker filling inside the tackle’s stunt. When 
the guard reads the linebacker hanging inside to fill the “B” gap, he simply drives off 
his outside foot and blocks the linebacker with a proper run-blocking demeanor.

QUICK SCREEN PULL 
The quick screen pull is executed by the playside tackle. Sometimes called a 
“running pull,” the quick screen pull is used to kick-out a cornerback who is 
attempting to cover the wide receiver. The quick screen, also known as the slip 
screen, involves the wide receiver driving off the line for two steps and then 
planting his feet to circle around behind the line of scrimmage to catch the ball on 
the run. Since the pass is a screen, the other offensive linemen are also using a 
screen blocking technique against the other defenders. However, the playside 
tackle’s block is the key block that springs the wide receiver on the play. While his 
teammates fan out to block their assigned defenders, the offensive tackle sprints 
to a point approximately two yards in front of the line of scrimmage. The tackle can 
visualize this pull as a type of extended fan block. He should pull neither too flat nor 
too sharply upfield. He must make contact with the cornerback with a tight fit. 
lronically, while his block is a key block, it isn't the tackle’s responsibility to make 
him get into position to contact the cornerback. It is the wide receiver's 
responsibility to bring the cornerback to the offensive tackle. The offensive tackle 
needs only to get his body under control just as he comes to within four yards of the 
receiver. Because the pass is a screen pass, the tackle does not need to be 
concerned with being downfield illegally or being flagged for interference. The 
tackle may legally block the cornerback past the line of scrimmage as the ball is 
thrown and he may legally block the cornerback while the ball is in the air. 
The other four offensive linemen basically perform a type of fan pull toward their 
assigned defenders as the ball is released. Some coaches run this play as a double 
screen with both tackles pulling to the widest cornerback. Other coaches run this 
play in the nature of a kick-off return blocking scheme—giving the interior linemen a 
numbered defender to block outward in the same manner as a kick-off return 
blocker. 
REVERSE SPIN PULL 
An extremely deceptive pulling technique for the reverse, the reverse spin pull 
resembles more of a ballet move than a block. The reverse spin pull is normally run 
by one or both of the guards. It seems to be most effective when the guards fake a 
block to one direction and then reverse spin to the opposite direction as shown in 
Diagram 6-21. The reverse spin pull calls for the guard to fake a zone block for three 
Steps to the side of the initial fake. If running the reverse to the left, the guard will 
fake his zone block to the right for three steps. He will then plant on his right foot 
and cross over with his left foot. He should zone block hard on an overly flat angle 
when he zones to the right. This action allows him to turn his shoulders nearly 
perpendicular to the line of scrimmage as he faces the right sideline. By 
overemphasizing the set to reach and turning his shoulders, the guard can quickly 
cross over with the left foot (or bucket step with the right foot) to spin around and 
begin pulling in the opposite direction. 

Ideally, the lead guard of the reverse will pull around the end and log any defender 
who redirects his pursuit as he recognizes the reverse. The backside guard will pull 
around the wall block and hammer block the cornerback who—by the time play 
develops—should be coming off his man or should be out of his zone to provide late 
run support. The reverse spin pull can be a game-breaking technique when used with 
a timely reverse off of a common sweep series.
