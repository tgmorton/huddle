# Adopting an Alignment Philosophy

Adopting an Alignment Philosophy 
Offensive coaches have a choice between two basic philosophies of formation 
Strength alignment: the same-side philosophy of alignment and the flip-flopping 
philosophy alignment. Which choice the coach decides to adopt can be dependent 
upon one or more of the following factors: 
e 
Coaching background. Coaches tend to coach in the system that is most familiar 
to them. As such, a preferred alignment philosophy tends to be rooted in the 
past experiences of the coach. 
¢ 
Offensive philosophy. The offensive philosophy of the coach is a significant 
factor in considering the choice of which formation philosophy to adopt. For 
example, coaches who utilize the dropback passing attack usually favor the 
same-side philosophy. 
¢ 
Personnel. One of the primary concerns of a coach is the degree of balance that 
exists in the talent level of his offensive line personnel. If his personnel is well- 
balanced along the line of scrimmage in talent and strength, the same-side 
philosophy is normally the favored alignment choice for that particular coach. 
The skills and competency levels of his running backs and their ability to deal 
with a flip-flopping system is also a consideration. 
e 
Level of play. Each philosophy of the formation strength alignment has both 
good and bad features with regard to the complexity of assignments and the 
execution of the player's individual techniques. As arule, the higher the level of 
play, the less need for flip-flopping of the formation strength. 
e 
The base set. The base backfield set of the offensive attack lends itself toa 
particular formation alignment philosophy. For example, split-back alignments 
are more compatible with flip-flopping than single back and |-back alignments. 
FLIP-FLOPPING VERSUS SINGLE-SIDE 
In a flip-flop system, the twin positions flip sides according to a formation strength 
call. One side of the offensive line is designated the “strongside.” When flip- 
flopping the line according to the strength of the offensive formation, the 
strongside guard, the strongside tackle, and the tight end will always align to the

On 
offensive strength. The remaining guard, tackle, and end are usually identified as 
the quick side, or the weakside, and will always align opposite the offensive 
strength. Other names for the quick side include the slot side and the split side. 
The term flip-flop comes from the concept that a particular athlete who Is playing 
guard will play on both sides of the center. If he is a strongside guard, he may align 
on the right side of the huddle as shown in Diagram 14-1. If the call is a Pro Right, the 
offensive strength will be to the right. When the offensive strength Is to the right, 
the strongside guard (and his strongside teammates) align on the right side of the 
ball. If the call is a Pro Left, the offensive strength will be to the left. When the 
offensive strength is to the left, the strong guard (and his strongside teammates) 
align on the left side of the ball. Moving from one side of the ball to another based 
on the called offensive formation strength Is called “flip-flopping.” 
When an offensive lineman plays exclusively on one side of the ball, the practice Is 
said to be a same-side philosophy. The same-side philosophy is an easy concept to 
grasp. Each lineman simply plays on either the right or the left side of the ball on 
every snap, regardless of the formation called.

A somewhat confusing concept to those offensive line coaches who have been born 
and bred into the same-side philosophy, the flip-flop practice does have one major 
advantage over the same-side philosophy—it reduces the number of defense fronts 
a player sees in the course of the game. For example, if a defensive scheme utilizes 
an unbalanced front such as a 30 Eagle Strong, the defensive front has a definite 
strongside and a weakside structure. To the offensive lineman on the weakside of 
the offensive formation, the front has a characteristic appearance that is different 
from the appearance presented to the strongside offensive lineman. This scenario Is 
shown in Diagram 14-4. 
The flip-flop system guarantees that the offensive linemen will see the same 
“look” every time they face an over-shifted front such as the 30 Eagle Strong. Since 
the defense will always have a tailored “strongside” and “weakside,” flip-flopping 
allows the strong guard and the strong tackle to work only against the strongside 
of the defense. Likewise, the weakside guard and the weakside tackle have to work 
only against the weakside of the defense. Despite the fact that defensive fronts 
declare the strength from one side of the ball to another on the basis of matching 
up to the strength of the offensive formation, the flip-flopping offensive line sees 
only one alignment structure.

Given the dynamics of the same-side philosophy, it can be seen that a team is faced 
with added preparation against a defense that uses an over-shifted front. As 
pointed out previously, an over-shifted front will present a specific strongside look 
and a specific weakside look. The defense will also declare its strength to either 
the right and left side, depending on the offensive formation strength. In essence, 
the defensive structure flip-flops on every snap, even though the defensive 
personnel may not physically flip-flop. Since all defensive structures flip-flop on the 
snap, the same-side offensive system could force the offensive linemen to block 
two different looks on any given play. Having to block two different looks against 
one defense doubles the preparation time a team needs for a single offensive play. 
For example, when a team employs the same-side philosophy and Is running an iso 
play versus an over-shifted defense, it is to practice running the same play against 
both the weakside look and the strongside look unless it plans on keeping its 
offensive strength consistent every time it runs the iso. Diagrams 14-7 and 14-8 
illustrate this particular negative feature of the same-side philosophy (i.e., how 
practice time is doubled for only one play in the same-side system). 
Flip-flopping the line also allows a team to be more creative in its approach to pass 
protection without adding an undue degree of complexity to the system that might 
otherwise confound the athlete. Pass blocking schemes can be designed that 
require the execution of two types of protection—one on the weakside and another 
on the strongside. If the offensive line is flip-flopping, they need only to learn the 
type of protection which corresponds to their side. If the offensive line is playing in 
the same-side scheme, they would have to recognize—according to the formation 
call—when they are supposed to use the weakside scheme and when they are

supposed to use the strongside scheme. Being able to tailor a team’s protection 
scheme according to strong side and weak side protection rules provides a team 
with an opportunity to simplify its passing game structure, yet be more creative in 
the options it may select to attack specific defensive weaknesses. 
Proponents of the same-side philosophy point out that the most important point in 
coaching the offensive line is the attention given to the repetition of technique. 
With the same-side scheme, the blocking assignments may change according to the 
defensive declaration, but the blocking technique will remain the same. For example, 
when a right tackle in the sameside blocking scheme blocks down, he will always 
execute the following actions: push off his right foot, angle step inside with his left 
foot, aim for the left hip or shoulder of the defender, use his right hand to punch and 
gain leverage under the defender’s left armpit, and use his right shoulder to block 
the defender. A flip-flopping offensive tackle has to be able to master those 
techniques with either foot, either hand and either shoulder. The technique teaching 
time for one type of block is consequently doubled for the flip-flopping lineman. 
Sameside alignment practitioners also point out that the communication required to 
teach and learn sameside blocking techniques is simpler than the communication 
involved in the flip-flop system. Instead of a right offensive tackle having to 
distinguish when he should step “inside” or drive “outside,” he can learn his 
techniques as “right” or “left” techniques—a more natural and familiar mental 
processing.

Despite the scheme friendliness of the blocking rules and the front recognition cues 
of the flip-flop system, the sameside scheme is normally the preferred system in 
the college and professional levels. Since the main advantage of the flip-flop 
system pertains to the offensive lineman applying his assignment rules, the flip-flop 
system tends to lose its appeal at a level of play above the high school level. As a 
rule, college athletes (while student-athletes) don't have to spend the entire day 
each day pursuing a regimented academic curriculum. Because of the larger blocks 
of time available for instruction for these higher level athletes and primarily 
because of the experience and relatively higher levels of intelligence of these 
individuals, the benefits of the sameside structural philosophy for these players 
tend to far outweigh those of the flip-flop alignment format. 
In the professional football ranks, a great amount of emphasis is placed on the 
backside tackle position. The predominance of the dropback passing attack, the 
multiple reads of the quarterback, and the irreplaceable quality of an NFL starting 
quarterback collectively require that the quarterback be protected from blindside 
hits. Consequently, the most valuable player on most offensive lines in the NFL is 
usually the left tackle. 
When you think about it, only a small group of linemen exist who can protect 
against the talents of the numerous Pro Bow! candidates playing defensive end. 
With roster restrictions and salary caps, an NFL team is lucky to find the one 
lineman who can guarantee the safety of the quarterback’s blind side. When the 
professional team does get the guy who can do the job, they don't want him flipping 
away from his primary role as a blindside protector—just because the formation 
strength has changed. This reason alone is reason enough to support the sameside 
concept of offensive line alignment. Several factors can be advanced to support 
either philosophy of formation structure. Chart 14-1 provides an overview of such 
factors. 
THE BOTTOM LINE 
Regardless of the formation structure adopted, an offensive lineman is ready to 
play when he has developed an understanding of the five bottom line techniques. 
Readiness to play can be viewed as a rite of passage for an offensive lineman. All 
factors considered, once he has demonstrated his abilities in each of the five 
bottom-line categories, an offensive lineman completes his apprenticeship as a 
developing candidate within the offensive line. The five basic bottom-line 
techniques include:

Playing with intensity and enthusiasm on every down. 
e 
Mastery-level knowledge of his assignments.

*Some teams keep their hole numbers the same, whether the team is in aright 
or left formation. As aresult, the odd numbers are always “left,” while the 
even numbers are always “right.” When flip-flopping, the weakside tackle (i.e., 
open-end tackle) is always the same. A team can put its best pass blocker at 
weak tackle to face the defenses’ best pass rushing end. Figuratively, the 
weak tackle is in “space” by himself without the help of the tight end, unlike 
the strong tackle.
