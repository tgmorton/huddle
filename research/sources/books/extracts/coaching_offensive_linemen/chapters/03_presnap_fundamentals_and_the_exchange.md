Presnap Fundamentals and the Exchange 
As ageneral rule, an offensive lineman should not change his stance from play to 
play. His stance should remain consistent on every snap, regardless of his 
assignment. The most common error committed by a young lineman occurs when he 
adjusts his stance to help himself accomplish his task. Young linemen often bend 
their elbows, or lean forward on their hands, so that they may fire off the ball more 
quickly and drive block their opponent. When assigned to pull ona 
play, 
inexperienced linemen tend to lean backward in their stance, barely touching the 
ground with their hands so that they may pull to lead interference for the ball 
Carrier. 
A lineman is more likely to feel the need to adjust his stance when he has not 
practiced the correct stance fundamentals on a daily basis. If a player leans 
backward to pull for interference, he hasn't received enough repetitions on pulling 
from a balanced stance. If a player leans forward on his fingers and tilts his body for 
a drive block, he hasn't received sufficient practice at drive blocking froma 
balanced stance. The only acceptable circumstances under which an offensive 
lineman can adjust his stance to gain an advantage are such situations as a definite 
passing down, a goal line short-yardage situation, or a time-related passing 
situation. The key point to keep in mind is that under normal circumstances, the 
offensive lineman should align in a balanced stance, no matter what his assignment. 
As with any football position, the proper technique begins with the proper stance. 
Normally, the ideal stance serves both the run blocking and the pass blocking 
technique. A balanced stance gives the offensive lineman the ability to move in 
eight different directions without tipping off his assignment to the defense. The 
eight directions of movement from balanced stance are shown in Diagram 3-1. 
The basic football stance that | recommend is a three-point balanced stance. A 
three-point stance gives the player an opportunity to maximize his leverage when 
performing all of the tasks of blocking. From drive blocking to pulling, the three- 
point stance is the best stance to initiate a proper run-blocking demeanor. A 
balanced three-point stance typically exhibits the following characteristics :

The toes should be pointed forward. 
The weight of the player should be centered on the inside of his feet. 
The base should be centered in his hips and buttocks. 
The player should be able to lift his down hand without affecting his 
balance. 
The proper power angle formed through the hips and shoulders: 
The ankles should be flexed. 
The heels should be on the ground (never raised). 
The knees should be ahead of the toes. 
The hips are flexed along with the bend of the knees and the flex of the 
ankles. 
The hands in a position to set the proper demeanor: 
The thumb of the down hand should be positioned inches forward of the 
shoulders. 
The weight should be slightly forward on the fingertips of the down hand. 
The off hand should be held open and placed on the side of the knee with 
the thumb pointing forward. 
The off-hand elbow should be tight to the body. 
The offensive linemen on the left side of the center should use a left- 
handed stance (i.e., left hand down). 
The offensive linemen on the right side of the center should use a right- 
handed stance (i.e., the right hand down). 
The center may use a one-handed (i.e., three-point) stance or a two-handed 
(.e., four-point) stance. 
The shoulders forming an adequate blocking surface: 
The shoulders should be square to the line of scrimmage. 
The shoulders should be parallel to the ground. 
The head and eyes leading the block: 
The head should be positioned so that the upper screws which connect the 
facemask to the headgear are facing forward. 
The eyes should be focused straight ahead, as the blocker looks through 
the down defender.

THE CENTER’S STANCE 
The center is the most unique position on the offensive line. Unlike coaching the 
other four to six positions, coaching the center requires that you teach how the ball 
is to be gripped, monitor the mechanics of the snap to the quarterback, and explain 
the nuances of blocking while snapping the football. 
The stance employed by the center is a balanced stance. The heels are slightly 
raised, and the neck is bowed. The hips are slightly higher than the flat of the back. 
The feet are evenly spaced with no stagger. The feet must be slightly wider than 
shoulder width, but only slightly wider. An exaggerated width of the stance is a 
detriment to blocking. The center can roll his heels slightly outward in his stance. 
The stance is opened by the heels rolling outward, thereby creating a power line 
and a torque in the hips. As a learning exercise for you as a coach, you should try 
assuming the center's stance and roll your heels slightly outward. In this instance, 
you should be able to feel the sensation of increased power In your hips. 
To many coaches, a four-point center stance is a preferred stance for balance. The 
four-point stance for the center offers specific positive features. For example, it 
lowers the center's shoulders. The four-point stance also benefits the back-block 
technique of the center, giving him a push hand or point hand as he blocks back to 
fill for a backside pulling guard. The four-point stance gives the center a push hand 
that allows him to push off as he snaps the ball. This capability adds more initial 
force on the center's movement. When blocking back, the center may use his onside 
hand as a point hand. The point hand is the hand the center uses.to point or open to 
the defender. As the center snaps the ball, the point hand snaps out to the target, 
providing a rubber-band effect on the body of the center. 

The three-point stance does not provide the center with these advantages. The 
three-point stance places the hand of the center behind the shoulders of the body. 
In the three-point center stance, the center normally rests his forearm across his 
knee. This will cost the center momentum as he loses a push hand and a point hand. 
The three-point stance, however, can give the center an advantage in pass 
blocking—particularly against a nose tackle. His up hand is placed near his knee, 
thereby making it closer to the target area of the nose tackle’s chest. His hand may 
be driven forward at the same moment of the ball moving backward on the snap. 
The up hand should be used to gain a feel and establish an inside leverage position 
to the defender’s chest, given the fact that it should strike the nose tackle slightly 
ahead of the snapping hand. 
For coaches who like a large bodied center, a three-point stance is preferred. An 
unduly large center will usually get top heavy in the four-point stance. On the other 
hand, a larger bodied center tends to have more power in the hips. Thus, he may get 
away with a slightly slower time to domination. 
Time to domination is the term used to describe the actual time it takes to obtain 
the three-inch movement of the drive block. A blocker’s time to domination is a 
product of his foot quickness and explosiveness off the ball. Great blockers get 
their first three steps down and obtain the desired three-inch movement ina 
minimum time to domination. 
The center's grip on the football is an important coaching point. The fingers of the 
center's off hand should be spread. The center places the ball under the 
corresponding eye of his snapping hand—only an inch or so to the side of his nose. A 
right-handed center places the ball under his right eye, while a left-handed center 
places the ball under his left eye. Although the ball should be placed as close to the 
midline of the center's stance as possible; placing the ball under the eye allows the 
center to snap the ball in a straight line. 
The center grasps the ball using a quarterback’s grasp. However, his four fingers 
should not be on the laces. He places his thumb on the laces, however, with his hand 
over the forward third of the ball. Without covering the point, he wraps his hand 
around the forward third of the ball. His wrist is rolled outward. Rolling the wrist 
outward forces the ball to tilt slightly with the nose up. The wrist should be locked 
in this position throughout the snapping motion. Keeping the wrist locked causes a 
natural rotation of the ball on the snapping motion. As a result, the quarterback will 
receive the ball slightly turned. The nose of the ball will turn left with a right- 
handed center, while the nose will turn right with a left-handed center. 
A right-handed quarterback should ideally have a right-handed center, while a left- 
handed quarterback should ideally have a left-handed center. Nevertheless, the 
center and the quarterback are cross-matched—the ball can still be delivered with 
the quarterback receiving the ball with the laces in the correct position. To get the 

perfect delivery with the cross-matched center and the quarterback, the 
quarterback need only move his grip a few inches toward the side of his weak hand. 
A right-handed quarterback should move his hands more to the left for a left- 
handed center, while a left-handed quarterback should move his hands more to the 
right for a right-handed quarterback. 
Part of any center-quarterback exchange is the role of the quarterback. The 
quarterback should be included in many of the center's group drills, so that they 
develop a partnership under stressful conditions. One coach should be in charge of 
the center-quarterback exchange. All factors considered, his responsibility should 
not be shared by the quarterback coach and offensive line coach. The offensive line 
coach can be responsible for coaching the quarterback on the proper hand 
placement and the snap-taking mechanics. Much time is often wasted on arguing 
over who is at fault during a bad snap. The thing to look for in a center-quarterback 
exchange is consistency. Even a repetitious problem can be fixed, if the problem is of 
a consistent nature. However, an exchange problem in which the center and the 
quarterback continually experience multiple breakdowns is probably best addressed 
by finding a new center. 
i 
After only a few days of instruction, the center and quarterback should develop an 
appropriate level of consistency to their exchange. As with the offensive line 
coach, the most important thing for you to remember as the instructor of the 
center- quarterback exchange is: Every center must practice daily with every 
quarterback. And—it is the responsibility of the quarterback to make the 
adjustment to the individual nuances of each centers particular snapping technique. 
You can prepare yourself for the inevitable “bugs” that may arise in the center- 
quarterback exchange by familiarizing yourself with the common problems 
experienced in the exchange. Your understanding of the cause of these problems 
and the respective cure for each position will go far in instilling confidence in your 
players. Among the factors that you should recognize with regard to a bad exchange 
are the following :

Center-quarterback exchange problems commonly occur in the red zone, close to 
the opponent's goal line. Red zone defenders usually align in the gaps in a goal-line 
stance. Situations in which the defensive overloads the middle (e.g., blitzes, 4th and 
short, etc.) require that the quarterback be especially conscious of receiving the 
snap before pulling out from the center. The center must be trained to expect 
surprise blitzes from the line of scrimmage and must not panic. The quarterback can 
often help the center by pausing his snap count if linebackers crowd the line of 
scrimmage over the center. The point to emphasize is that it is the quarterback's 
responsibility to never allow the blitzing defenders to get a timed running start 
through the “A” gap. 
The center can be trained to take advantage of a defensive encroachment. He can 
snap the ball when he recognizes that a defender is in the neutral zone. You can 
train your center to quickly snap the ball if he sees an encroaching defender. 
However, the quarterback must also be trained to expect a quick snap. You should 
keep in mind that the officials may not necessarily make the correct call and flag 
the encroachment. The result of the officials missing the play is a wasted play at 
best. A missed encroachment call and a quick snap on a 4th down play results ina 
wasted play and a loss of possession. Teaching your center and quarterback to 
execute the quick snap can be a productive strategy. It would be erroneous, 
however, to believe that such a strategy has never been a pivotal factor in the loss 
of a big game. In fact, games have been lost on a quick snap when the officials didn't 
see the encroachment and didn’t make the call. 
SPLIT 
The second important concept to master with regard to run blocking is the split. 
The term split refers to the distance between two adjacent lineman. The width of a 
split determines the size of the aforementioned gap. For instance, if a guard gets a 
large split from the center, the “A” gap is widened. If a tackle gets a large split from 
the guard, the “B” gap is widened. The player on the outside controls the split to his 
inside. 
Splits across the line of scrimmage can be firmly set as standard widths. However, 
splits across the line of scrimmage can be individually set by the players on a snap- 
to-snap basis. The accordion-like movement of a player who changes his split to 
enhance his blocking technique from down-to-down is called split manipulation. 
Some offensive schemes incorporate split manipulation as part of the offensive 
system. Option offenses and Wing-T offenses often require their lineman to 
manipulate their splits according to the play called. 
Generally speaking, line splits should ideally be kept at a standard distance from 
play-to-play. The split should be as wide as the distance that the outside player can 
control with an angle blocking technique. Quicker, stronger, more talented, 
offensive linemen can usually take larger splits than their slower, weaker, less 

talented, counterparts. The width of the split is also related to the talent levels 
and the techniques employed by the offensive linemen’s opponent. The penetrating 
technique of a talented defensive lineman may require your offensive lineman to 
close (i.e., reduce) his split. 
Diagram 3-2 shows the basic splits of a standard offensive attack. A list of the 
other factors that should be considered when setting your line splits include the 
following: the field conditions; the down-and-distance situation; the zone of 
operation (e.g., red zone, etc.); your predominant blocking scheme; and the blitzing 
patterns of the defense. 
Diagram 3-2: Basic line splits of a standard offensive attack. 
ALIGNMENT DEPTH 
The depth of the offensive alignment is determined by your philosophy of blocking, 
as well as the style of your offensive attack and the talents of your offensive line 
personnel. The alignment of your interior line can have a critical impact on the speed 
of the initial line charge. The alignment is also vital to the timing for both the single 
point of attack blocks (i.e., one-man blocks) and the combination blocks (i.e., two- 
man blocks). By rule, no part of an offensive lineman’s body can break the plane of 
the football before the snap of the ball. The only exception to this rule is the center 
position. Most centers, however, place the ball far enough in front of their body as 
to effectively comply with this rule. 
The area between the defenders and the offensive line is called the neutral zone. If 
an offensive lineman aligns as tight to the ball as he legally can, he can reduce the 
size of the neutral zone. This type of tight alignment to the ball is usually preferred 
by offensive line coaches who have physically strong, dominating personnel. It is a 
favored alignment of the “wheel and turn” specialists in the | formation offensive 

attack. The primary objective of a tight alignment is for an offensive lineman to 
engage the defender as quickly as possible and use his superior size and strength to 
carry him backward. 
Other styles of offensive attacks utilize a deeper alignment, thus creating a cushion 
in the neutral zone. In this type of style of attack, the blocking schemes are usually 
two-man schemes—particularly zone blocking schemes. Zone blockers can use the 
larger neutral zone to their advantage as they work together in reading the 
defensive reaction in a target area. As discussed in Chapter 5, a zone blocker will 
work together with an adjacent teammate to seal a pair of defenders from the 
pursuit. The dynamics of the zone block depends upon the reaction of the 
defenders. 
Any type of blocking scheme that includes a read of the defender as an integral 
part of the scheme’s execution is best facilitated by the offensive line aligning 
farther off the ball. As discussed in Chapter 6, most pass protection techniques are 
better served by an offensive lineman aligning as far off the ball as he is legally 
allowed. A pass protector wants to initially snap-up and create a cushion between 
him and the defender. 
Younger, inexperienced, offensive linemen may have difficulty keeping their 
alignment uniform down the line of scrimmage. You should be aware of this 
potential problem during the preseason and conduct drills that are designed to help 
the linemen develop a sense of the appropriate individual alignment landmarks to 
ensure uniform, straight, alignment down the line of scrimmage.

Generally, two main methods of landmark instruction are effective. One method 
involves having the linemen set their alignment by using the foot of their inside 
teammate as a guideline. You can stand on the end of the formation and look down 
the offensive line to check their alignment. Once you have adjusted their alignments 
to get them aligned uniformly at the desired depth, instruct the players to take note 
of their inside foot’s relationship to their teammate’s foot. You should then tell them 
to make sure their inside foot is in that same relationship each time they address the 
line of scrimmage. 
The second method of ensuring uniform alignment along the offensive line is to have 
the players use their teammates’ inside hand as a landmark. When using the inside 
hand as a landmark, the guards put their hand down on a plane passing behind the 
football. The tackles then place their hand down on the same plane as the adjacent 
guard's hand. This method is best when used by offensive linemen who align in a 
four-point stance. 
Whichever technique you use as a method of guaranteeing uniform alignment, make 
sure your offensive linemen are trained to remember that they cannot raise their 
hand once it touches the ground. This mistake is a common error by a younger 
lineman. More often than not he will realize that he didn’t align properly after 
putting his hand down, then pick up his hand to move inside, or move forward. The 
result is an illegal procedure penalty.

An excellent instructional aid for alignment uniformity involves the use of a hose. 
During our team’s preseason drills, you can place an old fire hose—or mark a chalk 
line—on the field. The offensive linemen can use this hose as a line marking the 
offensive edge of the neutral zone. They then can take note of their respective 
position to their inside teammate as they align as close to the hose as possible. To 
develop uniformity in a system that utilizes the deeper alignment, you can simply 
place the ball across the hose. The offensive linemen subsequently can use the 
hose as a guideline for their foot placement. This hose is marked with the standard 
spacing along the offensive line and can be used as a teaching tool during the entire 
season, not only for the offensive line, but for the running backs when they run their 
drills without offensive linemen.
