# Run-Blocking Schemes

---

Run-Blocking Schemes 
As arule, most running attacks are identified as much through the principal blocking 
scheme involved in the offense as it is with any other factor. For example, the 
running scheme involved in the offense as it is with any other factor. For example, 
the running phase of the Wing-T attack is characterized by the predominance of 
angle-blocking (gap) schemes. In turn, one of the definitive traits of the I-back 
attack is its use of matchup man-to-man blocking employing a wheel-and-turn 
technique. Furthermore, depending on the principle style of option used, an option 
attack is normally based either on a veer-blocking scheme or a zone-blocking 
scheme. A one-back running game, on the other hand, is normally based around a 
zone- ae aly scheme. 
The point to remember is that different offensive running attacks tend to employ 
the various run-blocking schemes to one degree or another and in one assorted 
combination or another. In order to gain a better understanding of the more popular 
run-blocking schemes, this chapter provides a brief overview of six run-blocking 
schemes: trap-blocking scheme; gap-blocking scheme; man-blocking scheme; veer- 
blocking scheme; outside zone-blocking scheme; and inside zone-blocking scheme. 
TRAP-BLOCKING SCHEMES 
The trap-blocking scheme is employed in every offensive attack at every 
competitive level of football. The term “trap” is derived from the scheme'’s original 
designation—“mouse trap.” One of the oldest blocking schemes in football, a trap 
scheme is designed to isolate a defender on the playside. The isolated defender Is 
normally influenced (i.e., baited) upfield, as a backside offensive lineman kicks him 
out. A trap scheme is drawn up to take advantage of defensive front-line 
penetration. A trap can be an excellent play when it is run in certain down-and- 
distance situations (e.g., first-and-ten; second-and-long; second-and-medium; etc.). 
Diagram 13-1 provides an illustration of and a descriptive overview of one of the 
more popular trap plays. 
GAP-BLOCKING SCHEMES 
A gap-blocking scheme usually involves a double-team block between the center/ 
guard, the guard/tackle, or the tackle/tight end combinations on the playside. In 
these gap responsibility schemes, the playside guard is responsible for the “A” gap; 
the playside tackle has the “B" gap; and the tight end is accountable for the “C”

gap. The center has a back block versus an even front. The backside guard pulls to 
the point of attack, while backside tackle either pulls on some plays, such as a 
counter trey (see Diagram 13-2 for an overview of the assignment on a counter trey 
play) or uses a hinge technique on power plays (see Diagram 13-3 for an illustration 
of agame-tested power play). 
MAN-BLOCKING SCHEMES 
Man-on-man blocking is the base blocking scheme employed in offensive football. 
Man-on-man blocking is normally used in every offensive attack at every 
competitive level of the game. While man blocking is a sound scheme against 
balanced defensive fronts, it is easily outnumbered at the point of attack against 
over-shifted and shade-stack defensive alignments. 
VEER-BLOCKING SCHEMES 
The veer-blocking scheme was originally developed for the triple-option, Houston 
veer offense. As such, veer blocking is one of the fundamental backbone elements 
of the triple option concept. Veer blocking is based on isolating a specific defensive 
lineman as the “read” for the quarterback. On a play that utilizes veer blocking, the 
quarterback reads the reaction of the designated lineman and then makes a decision 
whether to give the ball and proceed to his third option (i.e, pitching the ball toa 
dive back or pull the ball and proceed to his third option (i.e., pitching the ball to the 
trail back). The veer-blocking scheme is used in veer-type offensive attacks (e.g., 
the flexbone, the wishbone, etc.] 
OUTSIDE ZONE-BLOCKING SCHEMES 
On outside zone-blocking schemes, the offensive linemen attempt to gain horizontal 
leverage on the defenders. On plays involving outside zone blocking, the offensive 
linemen set to reach. Everyone on the offensive line is responsible for his playside 
gap. Outside zone-blocking schemes are utilized in stretch plays (see Diagram 13-4), 
toss plays (see Diagram 13-5) and some option plays. 
INSIDE ZONE-BLOCKING SCHEMES 
On inside zone-blocking schemes, the offensive linemen work horizontally through 
their playside gap. On plays involving inside zone blocking, the offensive linemen set 
to drive. Inside zone blocking is designated to provide upfield push on the plays 
involving inside zone-blocking schemes. Among the plays that employ inside zone 
schemes are slant (see Diagram 13-6), roll, fullback cut, and any inside play that is 
drawing to get the linebackers to flow and is designed to give the running backs an 
Opportunity to press the line of scrimmage and cut back.
