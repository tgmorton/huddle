# Pass Blocking

---

Pass Blocking 
Effective pass protection begins with a complete knowledge of the fundamentals 
involved and a mastery of the various techniques attendant to sound pass 
protection blocking. As such, your offensive linemen must not only be well-trained 
in the various skills, they must also know when to apply a specific technique. A 
protection technique can be categorized as a dropback protection technique, a play 
pass technique, or a sprint out/dash pass technique. A list of the individual 
dropback pass protection techniques includes the following:

The offensive lineman’s selection of a particular technique is directly related to the 
defensive alignment of his opponent. As with any football position, the proper 
technique begins with the proper stance. Normally, the ideal stance serves both the 
run-blocking and the pass-blocking technique. A balanced stance gives the 
offensive lineman the ability to move in eight different directions without tipping off 
his assignment to the defense. The eight directions of movement from the balanced 
stance are diagrammed in Diagram 8-1. 
1. Straight ahead 
2. Angle to the left 
3. Down the line to the left 
4. Off the line to the left 
5. Straight back 
6. Off the line to the right 
7. Down the line to the right 
8. Angle to the right

As was previously discussed in Chapter 3, the basic football stance that | prefer 
(and recommend) is a three-point balanced stance. A three-point stance gives the 
player an opportunity to maximize his leverage when performing all of the tasks of 
blocking. In Chapter 3, it was pointed out that the three-point stance is the best 
stance to initiate a proper run-blocking demeanor. We also teach our linemen to 
move comfortably into their pass protection set up from a three-point stance. The 
fundamental components of a three-point balanced stance should address the 
following coaching points: 
e 
The base. 
The feet should be positioned slightly wider than the width of the 
shoulders. 
The feet should be placed close to a parallel position (i.e., not staggered). 
The toes should be pointed forward. 
The lineman’s weight should be centered on the inside of the feet— 
especially on the inside foot. 
e 
The power angle. 
The ankles should be flexed. 
The heels should be on the ground (never raised). 
The knees should be ahead of the toes. 
The hips should be flexed along with the knees bent and the ankles flexed. 
e 
The hands. 
The thumb of the down hand should be positioned inches forward of the 
shoulders. 
The lineman’s weight should be slightly forward on the fingertips of his 
down hand. 
His off hand should be held open, with the thumb pointing forward and 
placed on the side of the knee. 
Offensive linemen on the left side of the center use a left-handed stance 
(i.e., left hand down). 
Offensive linemen on the right side of the center use a right-handed stance 
(.e., the right hand down). 
The center may use a one-handed (i.e., three-point) stance or he may use a 
two-handed (i.e., four-point) stance.

The shoulders. 
— 
The shoulders should be square to the line of scrimmage. 
— 
The shoulders should be parallel to the ground. 
e 
The head and eyes. 
— 
The head should be positioned so that the upper screws which connect the 
facemask to the headgear are facing forward. 
— 
The eyes should be focused straight ahead. 
e 
The base. 
— 
The player's base should be centered in his hips and buttocks.

As an offensive line coach, | also understand that situations arise during the game 
where everyone from the popcorn vendor to the opposition's defensive coordinator 
knows that we have to pass. When one of these situations is presented to us, we 
feel that a two-point stance Is best for enhancing our set up move for pass 
protection—particularly dropback pass protection. A proper two-point stance 
exhibits the following features: 
e 
The base. 
— 
The feet should be positioned slightly wider than the width of the 
shoulders. 
— 
The feet should be positioned in a slight stagger, with the outside foot 
slightly back. 
— 
The toes should be pointed forward. 
— 
The lineman’s weight should be centered on the inside of his feet— 
particularly on his inside foot. 
e 
The power angle. 
— 
The ankles should be flexed. 
— 
Theheels should be on the ground (never raised). 
— 
Thehips should flexed, along with the knees bent and the ankles flexed. 
e 
The hands. 
— 
Bothhands should be held open and with the thumb pointing forward and 
placed on top of the thigh. 

— 
The center may use either a one-handed (i.e., three-point) stance or a two- 
handed (i.e., four-point) stance. 
e 
The shoulders and back. 
— 
The shoulders should be square to the line of scrimmage. 
— 
The lower back should be arched, as the shoulders are pulled back and the 
back is held straight. 
e 
The head and eyes. 
— 
The head should be positioned so that the upper screws which connect the 
facemask to the headgear are facing forward. 
— 
The chin should be tucked back, so that the head Is level. 
— 
The eyes should be focused on the defender the lineman is blocking. 
— 
The player's eyes should sight his opponent through the bridge of the nose. 
e 
The base. 
— 
The base should be centered in the hips and buttocks. 
— 
The player's weight should be on his inside foot—particularly when 
expecting to make a kick move. 
— 
The player's weight should be shifted to the inside of his inside foot. 
SET UP 
The stance is the first phase of any type of block. The second phase of the pass 
block is the set up. The set up is defined as the snap up or the kick out to the 
prescribed depth of the pass set. The key to executing the proper set up is the 
quickness in making the move. The set up has to be made as quickly as possible. The 
outcome of an entire pass protection scheme is usually determined by the speed in 
which each offensive lineman makes his first move in setting up for the block. 
For the pass-blocking offensive lineman, the main purpose of the set up is to 
establish a cushion between himself and the pass rusher. The appropriate depth of 
the cushion—the proper amount of the separation—between the pass rusher and 
the pass protector is dependent upon the technique of the defender and the 
particular offensive line position. For example, an offensive tackle may kick-out to 
gain a separation of three to four feet against an angled defensive end aligned to his 
outside, while a center punches with his up hand on the snap to gain a maximum of 
12 to 18 inches of separation against a nose tackle. Setting to gain depth is also 
necessary for an offensive lineman to be able to read the pass rush, whether the 
scheme is either a man protection or an area protection scheme. 

An offensive lineman is required to master several types of pass sets. The one 
characteristic of every type of pass set is the inside-out relationship of the pass 
protector. An offensive lineman must set to protect the inside-out relationship to 
the pass protector. Simply setting to an inside-out relationship doesn’t guarantee 
that the offensive lineman will effectively protect the quarterback. It does, 
however, put the offensive lineman in the most suitable position for accomplishing 
his objective. Chapter 4 details the coaching points of the proper run-blocking 
demeanor. Among the factors that relate to a blocker snapping up into a proper 
pass-blocking demeanor include the following coaching points: 
e 
Keeping his shoulders square. 
° 
Setting his base to a staggered relationship to the blocker’s base—with the 
outside foot pointing to the crotch of the defender. 
¢ 
Keeping most of his weight balanced with a slight emphasis on his inside foot. 
e 
Keeping his butt low and his knees bent. 
e 
Keeping his elbows inside his body's frame. 
e 
Keeping his hands up with his thumbs pointing up. 
e 
Keeping his chin tucked and his head back. 
e 
Keeping his chest out. 
e 
Keeping his feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. 
On all pass set moves, the pass protector snaps up and gets his eyes on the target. | 
recommend that coaches teach their offensive linemen to target the breast plates 
of the defender. The pass protector should snap up and use the heels of his hands 
to punch the defender the chest. The blow should be made in an upward motion, as 
the blocker drives his hands up through the defender’s breast plates in a low-to-high 
plane. The blocker's goal in punching the defender is to stop the defender’s charge 
so that the defender has to restart and redirect his pass rush to another lane. The 
bag punch drill and the medicine ball drill are great drills for teaching the punch. 
HARD POST 
For an offensive guard who is facing an inside shaded defender, the desired pass set 
against an inside shaded defender is the hard post. The hard post is used against a 
2i technique defender, a 1 technique defender, and an onset-offset nose tackle 
aligned to his side. The main feature of the hard post move is a sharp lateral jab step

to the inside. The guard should push off his outside foot to throw his body inside to 
seal the “A” gap off from penetration. The primary objective of a hard post set Is to 
get to an inside-out or a head-up leverage position on the defender. The blocker 
should push off his outside foot and plant his inside foot to point at the toes of the 
defender's inside foot. As the guard hard post sets inside he should punch the 
defender in the breast plates while keeping the proper pass-blocking demeanor. His 
outside foot should also slide inside so that the blocker doesn’t overextend his base 
as he sets the hard post. It is important that both feet shuffle along the turf as the 
blocker shuffles inside. The guard should keep his feet in close contact to the turf 
as he sets inside. Both steps should be quick, hard, jab steps. 
If the guard is uncovered and is helping the center according to the area rule against 
an offset/onset nose tackle aligned to his side, the guard should hard post but keep 
his outside arm free. He should use his inside arm to drive to the near breastplate of 
the nose tackle. Striking the nose tackle’s breastplate stops his charge through the 
"A" gap and allows the center to punch and slide to a head-up position on the nose 
tackle. It is especially important that the guard punch upward into the nose tackles 
breast plate when using only his inside arm. By striking the nose tackle in the chest 
with a low-to-high block, the guard forces the defender’s shoulders upward and 
creates a better target surface for the center. Striking the nose tackle in the near 
breast plate also helps the guard to keep the guard's shoulders square. An area 
protection scheme requires that the guards keep their shoulders square when 
helping the center. Keeping their shoulders square is important for the guards if they 
are to pick up an inside twist game between the inside linebackers and the nose 
tackle. 
A tackle or a tight end would also use ahard post move if their assignment is to 
block an inside shaded defender. The tackle must be particularly alert to the 
possibility of the guard “talking.” If a dog blitz from a Eagle front shows inside the 
“A” gap, the guard will hard post to take the linebacker after making an “alert” call. 
The tackle should always keep his eyes inside when the guard is facing a 3 
technique. If an inside backer shows in the near “A” gap, the guard will have to slide 
inside and take the backer. By keeping his eyes to the inside, the tackle can visually 
pickup this stunt at the last second without the guard having to make the call. 
If the backer subsequently backs out on the snap, the guard will use the ‘jump ‘em” 
technique to grab the 3 technique. The tackle can easily recognize the guard jumping 
the 3 technique and quickly kick-out to help on the edge with no harm done to the 
basic integrity of the protection scheme. 
The center will hard post set when he is applying his man blocking rule against an 
even front. Against a front that is characterized by having a backside 1 technique or 
a Stack alignment, the hard post technique by the center can secure backside “A” 
gap.

Against a front that is characterized by a middle linebacker, the center can hard 
post to the near lineman to help the guard. When the center hard posts to help the 
guard, he should keep his eyes on the middle linebacker. If the linebacker over the 
center delays and dogs straight ahead, the center will simply push off the hard post 
set and slide ahalf-step to pick up the dog stunt.

If the middle linebacker loops around behind the near defensive lineman, the center 
and the guard can either switch assignments or remain locked in. If the lock-in 
scheme is used to pick up the twisting stunts, the center should remember to set 
slightly behind the guard's inside foot. 
By setting behind the guard's near foot, the center can simply slide behind the guard 
to pick up a twisting dog stunt. When the offensive linemen slide with the twist 
Stunts and remain locked in, the offensive lineman who is locked in on the linebacker 
should use the soft kick to set slightly off the line of scrimmage. 
Diagram 8-10: The center soft kicks behind the guard when the scheme locks in the 
guard on the down defender. 
lf two offensive linemen are pass blocking according to an area protection scheme, 
they will switch assignments on the middie twist. In an area protection scheme, the 
center should use the hard post technique when helping the guard. The hard post of 
the center builds a shoulder-to-shoulder wall, as he and the guard set shoulder to 
shoulder. If the center sees the middle linebacker looping, he should yell “switch, 
switch,” as he physically pushes the guard outward with his outside arm. Pushing 
the guard and yelling “switch” helps the guard recognize the stunt and cues him to 
- push off the penetrating defensive lineman and pick up the middle linebacker 
dogging through the “B” gap.

SOFT POST 
The second pass set is the soft post. The main move of the center versus anose 
tackle—the soft post technique—requires the offensive lineman to simply jab step 
his inside foot without moving hard to the inside. An offensive lineman uses the soft 
post move when a defender is aligned head-up on him. When pass blocking a 2 
technique, the guard will soft post by quickly picking up his inside foot. 
Picking up the foot helps the guard to snap up and punch his hands to the 2 
technique’s breastplates. The soft-post technique also helps rein in the guard's 
natural tendency to attack the 2 technique. A pass protector should never move 
forward into a defender; he should only move side-to-side or back. Upon picking up 
his foot, the guard immediately puts down his foot. The soft-post inside step Is 
made in the manner of a boot stomping on a scurrying insect. It is a quick, forceful 
step in one spot. 
As with every pass set technique, the pass protector should establish an inside-out 
staggered relationship to the pass rusher. He should soft post with his foot slightly 
inside of the defender's inside foot and set to the proper pass-blocking demeanor. A 
defender using a head-up technique may have the option of rushing to either side. 
Therefore, the pass protector should be ready for a pass rushing move to either side. 
The soft post is used by a center against a head-up nose tackle. The center should 
use a one-two punch combination as he soft posts with the foot corresponding to 
his up hand. A center using a four-point stance will deliver a one-two punch with his 

off-hand, followed by his ball-hand as he soft posts with the foot corresponding to 
his off-hand. Against a head-up nose tackle, a right-handed center should soft post 
with his left foot; a left-handed center should soft post with his right foot. 
The center, the guards, the tackles, and the tight ends all use the soft post move 
when dropback pass protecting against a head up technique. The snap-up and punch 
to the breastplates are crucial points to getting into the proper pass-blocking 
demeanor when using a soft post move. It is also very important that the blocker 
keep his chin tucked, head back and back flat when making the soft post move. 
SOFT KICK 
The third pass set technique is the soft kick. The soft kick is used against a tight 
outside shaded technique, such as a regularly aligned 3 technique, 5 technique, or 9 
technique. To soft kick, the blocker will push off his inside foot to take a short jab 
step with his outside foot. A coaching point that should be emphasized is: An 
offensive guard doesn't jump outside when he soft kicks. He basically picks up his 
outside foot and returns it to nearly the same Spot on the turf. 
For a guard, the soft kick is essentially the mirror technique of the soft post, except 
that the soft kick will results in a small degree of lateral movement as the kick foot 
slides approximately four inches outside. Unlike his soft post technique, the blocker 
will allow his back foot to slide with the kick foot. For example, when a guard soft 
posts against a 3 technique, his outside foot will kick and jab, while his inside foot 
will slide to reestablish the good base for a proper pass-blocking demeanor. If his 
inside foot doesn't slide with his kick foot, the blocker’s base will get too wide, 
Causing him to lose his power leverage. 
Punching the outside hand is an important coaching point involving the proper 
execution of the soft post. The heel of the outside hand should be driven through 
the outside breastplate of the outside shade. Punching the hand to the defender's 
near breastplate gives the pass rusher free leverage with the outside half of his 
body, since no resistance is applied. He can easily escape around the short edge of 
the pass set, if the blocker doesn’t reach to punch through his outside breast plate. 
By punching through the outside breastplate, the blocker actually pulls the inside 
half of his body outside and squares up on the defender. A lazy inside foot and a 
dead inside arm are common flaws of the undisciplined lineman’s soft kick 
technique. Teaching the “outside-hand-to-the-breastplate” coaching point forestalls 
the problem of a pass rusher getting off against the short edge. 
While an offensive guard doesn’t move much laterally on the soft kick, the offensive 
‘tackle does soft kick outside to gain more leverage on an outside shade. Since the 
tackle is further from the ball, he soft kicks one step off the ball as he widens by 
approximately two feet. The offensive tackle should soft kick with a proper pass- 
blocking demeanor—slightly inside-out of the defender. After kicking to set in the

eae ae ty 
Aetna 
exatndA

oar tell a hte oN 
WEISS 54 FAIS SAY ISIN oS 
proper demeanor, the tackle should initially keep his shoulders square. His outside 
foot should be slightly staggered behind the inside. His hips may be opened slightly 
to facilitate a quick pivot to the outside should the defender attempt a quick speed 
rush around the edge. If the pass rusher attempts to speed rush, the offensive 
tackle may quickly punch and open his stance to wall the pass rusher from the 
pocket. 
JUMP ‘EM TECHNIQUE 
The fourth pass set technique is the jump ‘em set. The jump ‘em technique Is a 
change-up technique for the soft kick set. Most often used as a quick pass 
protection, dash protection, or play pass protection, the jump ‘em technique is a 
quick jump to the outside into the proper pass-blocking demeanor. On the snap of 
the ball, the blocker using the jump ‘em technique literally jumps out to the side— 
landing in the proper pass-blocking demeanor to the defender. Not only does the 
jump ‘em technique blocker hop into the proper demeanor, he simultaneously 
punches both hands into the breastplates of the defender. From that position, the 
blocker works to maintain a snug inside-out relationship, while stalemating the pass 
rusher. 
KICK SLIDE 
The kick slide is the fifth pass set technique. The kick slide is used by an offensive 
tackle when he is presented with a wide pass rusher who Is pointing in to the 
backfield. The kick slide gives an offensive tackle added depth on the pass set. To 
kick slide, the tackle pushes hard off his inside foot—an easy task since most of the 
weight of the two-point stance should be on the lineman’s inside foot. The hard 
push off the inside foot gets the tackle moving backward and outward to intercept 
the angle of the wide pass rusher. Even though the kick sliding tackle is moving 
outside on the snap, he doesn’t turn his shoulders. Although his path is diagonal, his 
shoulders and hips remain facing forward. 
Once an offensive tackle kick slides, he can then shuffle backward to intercept the 
path of pass rusher. The kick slide puts the offensive tackle into a position that may 
appear to make him vulnerable to an underneath move, but this vulnerability is 
deceiving. Most offensive tackles would be happy to see a wide rusher attempt to 
cross his face and slip under the pass set. If an offensive tackle keeps his shoulders 
Square, a defender cannot beat him to the inside. Once the inside pass rusher closes, 
the offensive tackle can punch the defender, knock him off balance, and pin him 
down inside. 
If the pass rusher doesn't take the bait inside, he must attempt to get around the 
long corner. When an offensive tackle kick slides, the pass rusher must go deeper 
upfield before he can attempt to make a move on the blocker. Because of the kick 
slide, the pass rusher has to take two extra steps to speed rush around the edge. 

Diagram 8-12: Both tackles are shown using a kick slide to create the long corner. 
The kick slide is a technique sometimes used by offensive guards in drop back 
passing schemes which call for a fan pass protection. In such a scheme, the guard 
will have to kick slide versus a 50 front structure. 

Normally, a kick slider will punch first with his outside arm. As when punching from 
a soft kick technique, an offensive tackle should make sure that he punches his 
outside hand to the outside breastplate of the defender. Failing to punch the 
outside hand to the outside breastplate of the defender will give the pass rusher 
free leverage with the outside half of his body and make the corner short. 
DOUBLE READ 
The double read is a play pass protection technique. Although | am not an advocate 
of the double read protection (I only employ it in ano-back formation), | have 
included it in this chapter for those coaches who want to use it. Since the play pass 
is off of 
arun fake, the backside protection is sometimes outnumbered—and almost 
always outflanked. 
Diagram 8-14: Ona 
play pass, the backside protection is outnumbered; if the line- 
backer and the defensive end both rush, a team could have protection problems. 
A team can support the backside protection and balance the protection through one 
of two measures. One way to reinforce the backside protection is to send a running 
back to the backside. This approach is solid in theory and practice, but it has its 
drawbacks. The first disadvantage is the protection’s demand for a two-back or a 
three-back scheme. With a one-back scheme, you clearly don’t have another running 
back to fill the role of a blocker. The second flaw of sending an extra back to the 
backside to support the protection is the almost certainly distinguishable difference 
between the running play and the pass protection for the play pass based off of the 
same running play. Diagram 8-15 and 8-16 illustrate these differences. 

Diagram 8-15: On a running play, a team can be successful despite being outnumbered 
on the backside.

Another way to reinforce the backside protection of the play pass is through the 
offensive line scheme. While this approach doesn't provide the safety afforded by 
an extra man, it does give a team a way of having a solid protection if only three 
defenders blitz from the backside of an odd front (four from an even front). The plan 
involves the uncovered lineman double reading. A double read is a technique carried 
out by a lineman who is facing a linebacker over him. In the first phase of the double 
read, the double-reading lineman hard posts inside with his shoulders square. As he 
hard posts, the lineman peeks at the feet of the near linebacker. (The lineman 
wants to make it appear to the linebacker as if he is zone blocking playside.) 
lf the linebacker blitzes in the immediate area, the double-reading lineman 
disengages from the hard-post move and sets his demeanor to block the linebacker. 
If the linebacker’s movement shows that he is not blitzing in the immediate area, the 
blocker then pushes hard off his inside foot as he shoves the near defender with his 
inside arm in a punching manner. Pushing off the near defender assists the blocker 
who Is engaged with that defender and helps to propel the blocker back off the 
hard post. The key coaching point is to emphasize the outside pivot of the double 
reading lineman. As he pushes off with his inside hand, the lineman must pivot on his 
inside foot and open to the backside. He should pivot in a way to allow him to move 
in a perpendicular path off the line of scrimmage (i.¢., straight back). Any slight 
angling of the lineman’s path backward off of the pivot could result in the blocker 
being beaten by the outside linebacker blitzing from the edge.

backs to fake the run and block playside.

Diagram 8-18: A play pass with backside uncovered double reading allows the backs 
to fake the run and block playside. 
If no outside linebacker shows, the double reading lineman can set up approximately 
three to four yards deep and get his head on a swivel to protect the quarterback on 
the backside. 
Against some fronts such as the 4-3 structure, it is quite possible to have two 
offensive linemen double reading—the center and the backside tackle. Although | 
have never seen or used the double read scheme in my career, the only way to 
defeat a properly executed double read scheme is by blitzing both the inside and 
outside linebacker on flow away. Since the situation being described involves a run 
fake away from the backers, it is an unusual situation when both linebackers blitz 
the backside. While it is common for an outside linebacker to blitz a play pass action 
away from him, it requires the combination of a great defensive call and a poorly 
timed play pass call to result in both linebackers coming. Because. 
of the relatively 
unlikely occurrence that a full backside blitz will be called against play pass action, 
the double read protection scheme can prove to be a highly effective way of 
providing near maximum protection with the full benefit of the play fake. The double 
read technique of backside play pass protection can also make the play pass a safer 
eall from the one-back attack. 

Diagram 8-19: A play pass with the backside uncovered linemen double reading 
versus a 4-3 front can result in both the center and the tackle double reading to the 
tight end side. 
Diagram 8-20: A double read by the guard gives a solid quality to the backside 
protection of the one-back set play pass.

THE STACK TECHNIQUE 
A proper stack blocking technique requires each defender to punch hard to the near 
breastplate of the defender. When using a stack technique, the blockers will punch 
to their shared gap. The blockers punch with their gapside arm, while making a hard 
lateral step with their gapside foot. They should avoid getting their leverage arm 
tied up with the defender. Both blockers should keep their head on either side of the 
defender and should avoid getting caught up with the defender. 
When blocking a stack, the inside blocker must keep his inside arm free as he 
punches the defender with his outside hand. The outside stack blocker must keep 
his outside arm free as he punches the defender with his inside hand. Both stack 
blockers should visualize blocking one-half of the defender’s body. They should also 
understand that if the defender drives toward a particular blocker, that blocker will 
assume full responsibility of the defender and engage him with both arms in a good 
passing-blocking demeanor. The blocker who is “freed” by the down defender's 
movement should assist his teammate by forcefully shoving the defender toward 
his offensive teammate. He should, however, take care to keep his shoulders square 
as he shoves the defender. The free blocker must be alert for a twist stunt from 
another defensive lineman or linebacker.

ONE’S INSIDE (THE TRIANGLE) 
If a linebacker aligns between the 3 technique and the nose tackle, a triangle is 
formed. Diagram 8-24 shows the described alignment to the weakside. When a 
triangle is formed to the weakside as shown in Diagram 8-24, the guard must alert 
the offensive tackle that anose tackle is present and that a triangle exists. In other 
words, the guard always assumes that the tackle cannot see the nose tackle.

The mere presence of a nose tackle can be a problem for the tackle’s recognition of 
the front. The presence of a nose tackle and a man on the guard give rise to the 
possibility of a triangle over the “A” gap. If such a triangle exists, the guard alerts 
the tackle by saying “One's inside.” Whenever the guard tells the tackle that 
number is inside, the tackle must use the jump ‘em technique to block the 3 
technique on the guard. In fact, until the linebacker flattens the triangle (i.e., walks 
up on the line to blitz), the guard and the tackle will block the 3 technique with a 
stack blocking technique. If a linebacker shows a blitz in the “A” gap, the guard can 
yell “ backer” to the tackle. Whenever the guard makes an alert call to the tackle, 
the tackle knows that he must take the man on the guard. The alert negates the 
stack technique of blocking by the offensive guard and tackle. When an alert call is 
made, the tackle blocks the down defender with the jump ‘em technique and 
receives no assistance from the guard. 
Note: If a defensive lineman is particularly physical, the tackle may opt to use a 
down block technique against the defender and cave him down when the guard 
makes an alert call. 
The offensive linemen—particularly the guards—must learn to quickly recognize 
triangles inside the tackle box. Whenever a triangle exists inside the tackle, the 
guard should automatically make a “one’s inside” call to the tackle . Even if the 
scheme doesn't require the alert, the guard should make a habit of calling out the 
fact that one’s inside. Against a triangle, all of the linemen’s eyes should be up. Not 
only are the guard and the tackle affected, the near back must focus his scan to the 
outside hip of the tackle if a triangle blitz shows.

The presence of a triangle is a critical consideration whenever the protection is a 
man pass-blocking scheme. Missing a triangle call can result in a big defensive play 
and a quarterback sack. Consistently picking up the triangular blitz can be equally 
disheartening for the opponent and will certainly result in big plays offensively. The

last scenario of the triangle and “one’s inside” call is related to the backer 
attempting to slip outside through the “B” gap. The 3 technique will drive across the 
face of the guard as the backer loops through the “B” gap. If the guard and tackle 
use a good stack blocking technique, the guard will keep his shoulder’s square and 
pick up the down defender while the tackle meets the backer in the “B" gap.
