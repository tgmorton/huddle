DRILL #2: MIRROR DODGE DRILL 
Objective: 
To develop an offensive player's ability to move laterally and to maintain 
proper leverage on the defender. 
Equipment Needed: Two cones. 
Procedure: Two cones are placed approximately four yards apart on a line. Two 
players positioned themselves as shown in Diagram 9-2. One lineman plays the role 
of a pass protector, while the other lineman assumes the role of a pass rusher. The 
pass protector places himself in a proper pass protection demeanor. The pass 
rusher works from cone to cone in an attempt to beat the pass protector to either 
side. The pass protector works to keep his body in front of the pass rusher as the 
pass rusher moves from side to side. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The pass protector should get repetitions from both a two-point and a three- 
point stance. 
e 
To emphasize footwork, the pass protector should be required to participate in 
the drill with his hands held behind his back. 
e 
Thecoach should emphasize to the players that this drill is anon-contact drill. 
The players should keep a cushion between them as they compete in the drill.

DRILL #3: PUNCH THE LINE (SET TO INSIDE RUSH) 
Objective: To develop the offensive lineman’s punching ability when pass protecting 
versus an inside rush. 
Equipment Needed: Five-man sled. 
Procedure: 
The players form a single line at the left end of the sled. One at a time, 
the players slide across the face of the sled. Each player shuffles down the sled and 
strikes each pad with his hands. A shuffling player should keep his right foot 
forward as he shuffles down the line. The player strikes each pad with his thumbs 
pointing up. His head should be back and his elbows should be held close to his 
sides. His feet should maintain a solid base under his body. The player may step into 
the pad with his forward foot to increase the force of the punch to the pad. After 
each player has completed one repetition to the right, they reverse directions, while 
employing the same technique. When moving to the left, the player keeps his left 
foot forward. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The coach should remind the players that they are practicing the set-to-inside 
rush technique. 
e 
The coach should check to make sure that the players are using the proper pass- 
blocking demeanor. 
e 
The coach should structure the drill so that adequate spacing between the 
players is maintained. 
e 
In place of a five-man or seven-man sled, the drill may be run with five players 
holding shields. 
e 
The player should punch the pads with great intensity, lifting the sled if 
possible. 

DRILL #4: PUNCH THE LINE (SET TO OUTSIDE RUSH) 
Objective: To develop the player's punching ability when pass protecting versus the 
outside rush. 
Equipment Needed: Five-man sled 
Procedure: 
The players forma 
single line at the left end of the sled. One at a time, 
the players slide across the face of the sled. Each player shuffles down the sled and 
strikes each pad with his hands. A shuffling player should keep his left foot forward 
as he shuffles down the line. The player strikes each pad with his thumbs pointing 
up. His head should be back and his elbows Should be held close to his body. His feet 
should maintain a solid base under his body. The player may step into the pad with 
his forward foot to increase the force of the punch to the pad. After each player has 
completed one repetition to the right, they reverse directions while employing the 
same technique. When moving to the left, the player keeps his right foot forward.

DRILL #5: SNAP UPS 
Objective: To increase an offensive lineman’s speed in getting out of his stance and 
into the proper pass-blocking demeanor. 
Equipment Needed: None. 
Procedure: Two players face each other. One player is the pass protector; the other 
player is the defender. The pass protector assumes a three-point stance. The 
defensive player stands in front of the pass protector and holds his hands over the 
head of the pass protector. On the coach's command, the pass protector snaps his 
head up and sets in the proper pass demeanor. The defensive player's objective is to 
provide resistance to the pass protector. The pass protector should snap his head 
and chest upward through the hands of the defensive player. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The defensive player should not interfere with the snap-up to such a point that 
the integrity of the drill is lost. 
e 
This drill is a good time to work on the team’s check-off audible system. 
e = This drill may be done against a simulated defensive lineman. The pass 
protector’s objective in this case would be to set and punch the hypothetical 
defender before the defender can grab the pass protector.

DRILL #6: PASS SETS 
Objective: To sharpen an offensive lineman’s pass setting ability against the three 
basic shades of a defensive lineman: inside; head up; and outside. 
Equipment Needed: None. 
Procedure: 
This drill may be structured as a group drill (e.g., 5-on-5, 3-on-3, etc.) or a 
1-on-1 drill. In the 1-on-1 procedure, two players position themselves across the line 
of scrimmage from each other. The player acting as a defensive player aligns in the 
specified shade. On the coach's command, the offensive player executes the 
appropriate pass set. The offensive linemdn should use the hard post set technique 
against an inside shade alignment. Against the head up alignment, the offensive 
player should use the soft post. Against the outside alignment, the offensive player 
should use the soft kick. After the offensive player has performed the three 
specified techniques, the two players switch roles. 
Coaching Points: 
i 
e 
The coach should emphasize to the offensive lineman the points of correct 
footwork and body position in his set. 
e 
The pass protector may use either a two-point or a three-point stance. 
e 
The pass protector should set himself to gain an inside-out relationship on the 
defender. 
e 
The pass protector’s inside foot should be positioned slightly inside of the 
defender. 
e 
The center should use the hard post technique against shaded alignments. He 
should use the soft post technique against a head up nose tackle.

DRILL #7: 1-ON-1PASS PROTECTION 
Objective: To develop an offensive lineman’s pass protection skills against a live 
pass rusher. 
Equipment Needed: A pop-up bag. 
Procedure: 
The offensive line unit is aligned along a scrimmage line. A defensive 
lineman aligns over each offensive lineman, and the pop-up bag is placed seven 
yards behind the center. On the coach's command, the center snaps or moves the 
ball, the designated pass protector pass sets to punch the defender. The defender 
uses one of his pass rushing techniques in an attempt to get to the pop-up bag. 
After the first man in line (i.e., the offensive tackle) completes his repetition, the 
offensive line coach signals the next lineman (i.e., the guard) to get ready for his 
opportunity. The drill then progresses down the line of scrimmage. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The center should have someone to whom he can snap the ball on his repetition. 
e 
The pop-up bag can be moved to different depths to practice the various 
protection schemes. 
e 
The pass protector should block until the whistle is blown.

DRILL #8: MULTIPLE MAN 
Objective: To develop an offensive linemen’s ability to work together and to pick up 
the two-man defensive pass rushing games. 
Equipment Needed: A pop-up bag. 
Procedure: A pop-up bag is placed approximately seven yards deep to simulate a 
quarterback setting to pass. The offensive linemen are grouped in different 
combinations (e.g., tackle-tight end, tackle-guard, guard-center-guard). The 
offensive line coach selects a combination to execute the block and positions two 
defenders over the selected alignment combination. One coach stands behind the 
offensive linemen and signals the desired defensive twist stunt. Another coach 
stands behind the defensive linemen and signals the snap count. On the snap, the 
defenders execute their stunt and the offensive linemen work together according to 
their protection rules. The offensive linemen block until the whistle is blown. 
Coaching Points: 
¢ 
The coach should make sure that each blocking combination encounters each of 
the basic defensive pass rush games. 
e 
Thecoach should check to ensure that each player is demonstrating the proper 
blocking demeanor and techniques.

DRILL #9: COMBINATION-MAN GAMES 
Objective: To develop offensive linemen’s ability to work together and pick up the 
three-and four-man defensive pass rushing games. 
Equipment Needed: A pop-up bag. 
Procedure: A pop-up bag is placed approximately seven yards deep to simulate a 
quarterback setting to pass. The offensive linemen are aligned in different 
combinations (e.g., left side, right side, whole line, etc.). The offensive line coach 
selects a combination to execute the block and positions three or four defenders 
over the selected alignment combination. One coach stands behind the offensive 
linemen and signals the desired defensive game. Another coach stands behind the 
defensive linemen and signals the snap count. On the snap, the defenders execute 
their stunt, and the offensive linemen work together according to their protection 
rules. The offensive linemen block until the whistle is blown. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The coach should make sure that each blocking combination encounters each of 
the basic defensive pass rush games.

DRILL #10: MEDICINE BALL SET 
Objective: To develop an offensive lineman’s ability to punch the pass rusher. 
Equipment Needed: A medicine ball. 
Procedure: Two offensive linemen stand approximately seven feet apart. Both 
linemen assume a proper pass-blocking demeanor. While chopping their feet in 
place, the linemen pass the medicine ball back and forth between them. The 
offensive lineman receiving the pass punches the ball back to the passer’s chest. 
The punch pass is made from the chest, as the offensive linemen continually move 
their feet.

DRILL #11: SOFTBALL SHUFFLE DRILL 
Objective: To develop an offensive lineman’s hip flexibility and footwork. 
Equipment Needed: A softball. 
Procedure: Two cones are positioned approximately 12 feet apart. Standing next to 
one of the cones, one lineman assumes a proper pass-blocking demeanor. The other 
lineman rolls the softball to a point near the other cone, as the offensive lineman 
stays low and shuffles to tap the ball back to his teammate. The lineman continues 
to shuffle back and forth between the cones, as his teammate alternately rolls the 
ball to each cone. The players switch roles after approximately 20 seconds. 
Coaching Points:

DRILL #12: LEVERAGE DRILL 
Objective: To develop an offensive lineman’s ability to regain leverage and to 
execute proper hand positioning against a defender who uses his hands. 
Equipment Needed: None. 
Procedure: Two players assume the proper pass-blocking demeanor approximately 
two feet apart. One player acts as an offensive lineman, while the other serves as a 
defender. The offensive lineman establishes the proper hand positioning to the pass 
rusher’s chest and drives the defender for a couple of steps. After a few steps 
backward, the defender fights to gain proper hand positioning against his teammate. 
The defender then becomes the blocker, as he establishes proper hand positioning 
with the proper pass-blocking demeanor. The drill continues until each player has 
had several opportunities at fighting to regain the proper hand positioning. 
Coaching Points: 
- 
e 
Both linemen should keep their shoulders low and their backs flat.

DRILL #13: BAG PUNCH DRILL 
Objective: To develop an offensive lineman’s ability to punch with a low-to-high 
thrust through a defender. 
Equipment Needed: A hanging bag. 
Procedure: Two offensive linemen stand on opposite sides of a hanging bag. One 
player functions as a “feeder” to a pass blocker. The pass blocker rapidly punches 
the bag with an upward thrust as the feeder stabilizes the bag, while helping return 
the bag to the blocker. The feeder makes sure that the bag “yo-yo's” during the drill, 
forcefully pushes the bag into the pass blocker’s body. 
Coaching Points: 
e 
The pass blocker should keep a proper pass-blocking demeanor during the drill. 
e 
The pass blocker should keep his feet moving as he punches the bag. 
e 
The pass blocker should punch the bag with the heels of his hand while keeping 
his thumbs up.
