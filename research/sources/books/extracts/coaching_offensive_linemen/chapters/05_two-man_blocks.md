Two-Man Blocks 
The second major category of offensive line run blocks is the two-man block. Two- 
man blocks involve blocking techniques executed by two linemen working together 
as a tandem unit. Among the various types of two-man blocks are the following:

COMBO BLOCK 
Also known as the bump block, the combo block is an excellent scheme to counter 
defensive stack alignments. The combo is nearly identical to the double-team block 
in that it consists of a post block and a seal block executed by two adjacent 
offensive linemen. 
The primary objective of a combo block is two-fold—vertical movement of the down 
defender accomplished with an outside seal of the linebacker. The inside man (the 
post blocker) of the combo block drives his man backward, thereby winning the 
three-inch battle.

Diagram 5-2: Vertical movement of the defensive lineman is the primary objective of 
the combo block. 
The outside man (seal blocker) glide steps inside and strikes the defensive lineman 
with the flat surface of his inside shoulder pad. The seal blocker’s primary objective 
is to lift and turn the outside shoulder of the defender. This action opens the 
shoulders of the defensive lineman so that the post blocker can swing his hips to 
the outside and gain outside leverage as he drives the defender upfield. When the 
defender’s outside shoulder is elevated and twisted backward, the blocking surface 
is increased for the post blocker. The post blocker then needs only to slide his head 
and hips to the outside edge of the defensive lineman to gain outside leverage as he 
drives him upfield.

After driving through the outside shoulder of the defensive lineman, the seal 
blocker ricochets off the block and cuts the outside thigh pad of the linebacker. This 
portion of the combo block is sometimes referred to as the “bump-seal.” 
Diagram 5-4: The seal blocker knocks the defender's outside shoulder backward and 
then seals the linebacker. 
The dynamics of the combo block allow it to account for any action of the stacked 
defenders. This feature of accountability versus the stack games (stunts) begins 
with the set to drive step by the post blocker. The post blocker will set to drive 
with either his outside foot or his inside foot, depending upon the anticipated action 
of the down defender. If the defender is aligned in a position from which he could 
Stunt inside, the post blocker sets to drive with his inside foot. If the defender is 
aligned in a definite outside shade, the post blocker sets to drive with his outside 
foot because the defender is not a threat to successfully stunt inside. It should be 
kept in mind that the set-to-drive step—if properly executed—is only a four-inch 
step. The post blocker keeps his pads square at all times. Over-striding on the set- 
to-drive step inside will create a gap between the hips of the post blocker and the 
seal blocker. 
The second feature of the combo block that provides accountability for the stack 
games is the hip-to-hip coaching point. Although the post blocker has some 
responsibility in maintaining hip-to-hip contact with the seal blocker; it is primarily 
the responsibility of the seal blocker to establish the hip-to-hip relationship. Once 
their hips make contact, the seal blocker must work to maintain this hip-to-hip 
relationship with the post blocker. Maintaining hip-to-hip contact between the seal 
blocker and the post blocker guarantees the seal between the two blockers and 
denies the down defender the opportunity to split the blockers.

If the down defender splits the blocker’s hips, he can keep outside leverage on the 
post blocker and break the seal of the combo. It should be remembered that sealing 
ve 
defenders inside is the second element of the two-fold objective of the combo 
ock. 
Diagram 5-8: The seal blocker is responsible for maintaining hip-to-hip contact with 
the post blocker. 
Achieving lift on the defender is one of the primary goals of the two blockers. Lift is 
accomplished by both blockers punching upward in an uppercut manner to the 
defensive lineman’s breast plates. Some defenders—particularly outside shaded 
defenders—will attempt to drop to the ground when they recognize the seal blocker 
glide stepping inside. This defensive technique can break down the integrity of the 
hip-to-hip seal if the blockers are not hitting on the rise through the defender. 
To hit on the rise, both blockers should use their near arm as a hook. The seal 
blocker uses his inside arm as a hook, while the post blocker uses his outside arm as 
a hook. If the blockers keep their shoulders square, the hooking technique with the 
near arms can catch the defender before he drops to the ground. 
An important coaching point to emphasize is that: You should coach your seal 
blocker to stay engaged ona down defender until he feels vertical movement on the 
defender—or until he feels the defender stunt inside across the face of the post 
blocker. The uppercut hooking technique by both blockers is discussed in greater 
detail in this chapter's section on the double-team block. 
For the seal blocker to contact the outside shoulder flush with his inside shoulder 
pad, the blocker has to glide step. The glide step is a sideways step inside to the 
post blocker. A good glide step is made slightly upfield with the toes pointing 
forward. The step is enhanced by the blocker pushing forcefully off his outside foot.

A proper glide step keeps the shoulders square as the seal blocker engages the 
defender and allows the blocker to use his inside arm in the hooking manner 
described previously. The glide step is also the first step of an escape move used by 
a playside blocker on the trap. Escape moves are discussed in greater detail in 
Chapter 4. 
Glide step. 
Diagram 5-9: The seal blocker takes a glide step. 
As previously stated, a successful combo block achieves two primary objectives— 
the down defender is knocked off the ball and sealed inside and the scraping 
linebacker is cut down by the seal blocker. To cut down the linebacker, the glide- 
stepping seal blocker must rip his inside arm and pad through the outside pad of the 
down defender. As he clears the defender, the seal blocker must look inside to pick 
up the angle of the linebacker’s scrape. He should then adjust his path and chop his

Two finishing techniques are available to the seal blocker. The seal blocker may 
either finish the combo block by driving his inside shoulder pad through the outside 
hip and thigh pad of the linebacker or finish the combo block by drive blocking the 
linebacker with a good fit and run-blocking demeanor. If the seal blocker attempts 
to cut the linebacker, he should make sure he snaps his head up as he delivers the 
blow to the outside hip of the linebacker. 
Many offensive linemen tend to drop their head down when they execute a cut 
block. This action is a major blocking flaw which prevents the blocker from hitting 
through the defender. When the head is down, the force of the blow is delivered 
toward the turf. The point to emphasize is that the blocker should always strike the 
opponent with a low-to-high blow delivery. 
A few additional factors should be considered concerning the seal block 
combination. The coaching points for the post blocker and the seal blocker account 
for all possible defensive stunts. If the down defender stunts outside as shown in 
Diagram 5-11, the combo block turns into a double team. When gliding inside, the 
seal blocker should keep his eyes on the near foot and hip of the down defender. If 
the defender's outside foot steps outward, the seal blocker can recognize the 
defender stunting outside. Once the seal blocker recognizes the outside stunt, he 
converts the combo block into a solid double team block. 
Diagram 5-11: The seal blocker sticks on the defender stunting outside. 
lf the down defender stunts inside, the seal blocker can read the near foot and hip 
of the defender disappearing inside. The seal blocker can then immediately find the 
linebacker. Searching out the linebacker allows the seal blocker to immediately 
move to junction the linebacker's path. When the down defender stunts inside, the 
seal blocker should use the drive blocking technique against the linebacker. Such a 
defensive game characteristically has a tight scraping linebacker. In such a situation 

Diagram 5-12: The seal blocker moves up to the second level to junction the 
linebacker when the down defendér stunts inside. 
the face-up drive blocking technique with a good fit and run-blocking demeanor is 
the better technique against a tight scraping linebacker. 
CROSS BLOCK 
The cross block is similar to the fold block in that two blockers cross paths to create a 
seam. However, that similarity is the only common ground between these two types 
of two-man blocks. Performed by two adjacent offensive linemen, the cross block is a 
blocking scheme in which two blockers perform angle blocks on two down defenders. 
The blocker positioned on the outside of the tandem goes first as he executes a down 
block. The inside blocker takes a position step with his outside foot, opening his 
shoulders so that his outside teammate has clearance for his down block. The inside 
blocker should jerk his outside elbow backward to open his hips as he position steps. 
His initial step is very similar to the first step of a G-block pull. The trap pull section on 
the G block in Chapter 6 provides a detailed discussion of the G-block technique. 
As the down blocker clears underneath the set of the inside blocker, the inside 
blocker takes his second step. As the inside blocker steps with his inside foot on the 
second step, he should reach to grab the outside cheek of the down blocker's 
buttocks. Using his inside hand, the inside blocker should pull himself forward ona 
tight angle off the tail of the down blocker. This reach-and-pull technique with the 
inside hand ensures a tight fit off the tail of the down blocker and a good inside-out 
path to the defender.

To finish the hybrid fan block-trap pull, the inside blocker aims for the near hip of the 
defender. Against a reading defender, the fit of the inside blocker's technique must 
be that of a proper fan block—not too flat and not too sharp. The one-man fan block 
section in Chapter 4 provides an overview discussion of the proper landmark of the 
fan block. Against a penetrating defender who is ignoring the down block of the 
outside blocker, the fan block becomes a short trap pull. The inside blocker must 
kick out the penetrating defender with the trap pull technique, using his outside 
shoulder to drive the defender outward. 
Diagram 5-13: The cross block. 

Diagram 5-15: The cross block versus a penetrating defender. 
The cross block is an excellent isolation scheme against an 4-4 even front. When 
facing a playside 3 technique tackle with a playside 7 technique end, the cross block 
scheme is the favored scheme for splitting the “B” gap on the isolation play. 
Diagram 5-16: The isolation play with a cross block. 
The cross block is also a great way to split the weakside of the defense from the 
one-back set when the defensive front removes a linebacker to cover a running back 
who is aligned as a wide receiver. The trips formation can provide you with an 
excellent opportunity to use the cross block against the weak side of the defensive 
front. 

Diagram 5-17: The dive play with a cross block off motion to the trips formation. 
An important coaching point with regard to the cross block is that it is basically a 
line call. This point refers to the fact that the block is called at the line by one of 
the two blockers. Since the block is usually executed by the playside guard and the 
tackle, the block is normally called by the guard when he and the tackle are each 
facing a defensive lineman. The cross block should only be called when the inside 
blocker is facing an outside shade. If the inside blocker is facing an inside shade, the 
cross block scheme Is an inappropriate scheme.

technique. 

Diagram 5-19: The isolation play with a cross block against a 2 technique. 
When calling a cross block, the offensive guard must understand the relationship of 
the linebacker to the formation. For example, if a guard calls a cross block when the 
play is a base dive from a one-back set, he must understand that the near linebacker 
must be removed to a position outside of the offensive tackle box.

where the linebacker doesn't bump out. 
DEUCE BLOCK 
Appropriately described as an inside-out combo block, the deuce block is a two-man 
scheme that is used on the playside of the counter trey play. The deuce block 
technique is also similar to the inside zone block in that the inside blocker executes 
a “hanging” technique as he drives the defensive lineman backward.

Tyla et

Tae ees ne 
Diagram 5-21: The deuce block by the right guard and right tackle on the counter trey 
play. 
When properly executed, the deuce combination seals the down defender inside 
while it carries him upfield. The deuce block begins a double team as the primary 
blocker sets to drive with his outside foot. The outside blocker initially blocks down 
on the defensive lineman but quickly adjusts his technique to that of a backside 
blocker in an inside-zone combination. 
Like an inside zone technique and the combo block, the premium is on getting 
vertical movement of the defensive lineman. The inside blocker is the primary 
blocker as he initially uses a drive blocking technique to engage the inside half of 
the defender’s body. It is his responsibility to hang on to the defensive lineman until 
the outside blocker works his tail around to gain a face-up position on the defender. 
Diagram 5-22: The tackle knocks the guard off to the inside as he takes over on the 
deuce block. 

The timing of the block is such that the outside blocker normally takes over the 
defender between the third and fourth step of the inside blocker’s hanging post 
block. The inside blocker can release off the hanging technique when he feels the 
outside blocker mesh with him and take over the vertical movement of the defender. 
In essence, the outside blocker bumps the inside blocker off to the inside and takes 
over control of the defender. 
Once the outside blocker bumps the primary blocker to the inside, the primary 
blocker looks to seal the inside linebacker. The timing of the release of the primary 
blocker off the double team normally puts him in a position to capture a linebacker 
who has diagnosed the counter trey and is redirecting his flow back to the playside. 
One important coaching point to the primary blocker’s technique that should be 
emphasized is: /f the primary blocker recognizes that a linebacker has prematurely 
recognized the counter flow and is scraping underneath the deuce block, the 
primary blocker must immediately disengage the vertical movement and come off 
on the scraping linebacker. The most dangerous defender in a pair of defenders is 
always the defender to the inside. Therefore, even though the inside blocker 
functions as the primary force of vertical movement against the defensive lineman, 
his ultimate responsibility is the linebacker. Some coaches refer to the technique of 
the inside blocker as a “peek” technique. The inside blocker can afford to hang on 
the down defender as long as he peeks inside for the linebacker and sees no threat. 
Diagram 5-23: The guard sees the linebacker getting a quick read and slipping 
underneath. 
If the primary blocker feels that the inside linebacker is not a presnap threat, he 
alerts the outside blocker that he is hanging. If the primary blocker feels that the 
inside linebacker is a threat because of his presnap alignment, the primary blocker 
can alert the outside blocker with a “gap” call. When the inside blocker calls “gap,” 
the outside blocker changes his technique from an inside zone technique to a down 
block. 

Diagram 5-24: The linebacker cheats into the “A” gap. The guard makes a “gap” call. 
The gap call results in both blockers blocking inside with a down block technique. 
The down block technique allows the blockers to stop defensive penetration and 
caves the defensive line down to the inside. 
DOUBLE TEAM BLOCK 
Without question, the oldest two-man blocking scheme in football is the double 
team. The standard double team involves both blockers getting the point of their 
shoulders together to form one large blocking surface. They work hip-to-hip as they 
sweep the defensive lineman upfield. The double team is ideally finished with the 
blockers flipping the defensive lineman over and pinning him on his back 
approximately five to seven yards past the line of scrimmage. 
Double teams are commonly thought of as outside-in blocks as shown in Diagrams 
5-25 through 5-27. The inside blocker normally provides the post (i.e., lift and 
movement) to the combination, while the outside blocker secures the outside 
leverage and assists in the lift and movement. Inside-out double teams are also 
effective schemes against the inside shaded defender—particularly when the 
defense offsets the nose tackle away from the shade as shown in Diagram 5-28. 
On an inside-out double team, the outside blocker is the post blocker while the 
inside blocker is the seal blocker who seals the defender out of the running lane. 
The outside blocker provides the lift and movement, while the inside blocker 
secures the inside leverage and assists in the lift and movement of the inside 
shaded defender.

Two basic coaching philosophies predominate the teaching of the double team 
block. One philosophy strictly requires both blockers to sell out on the defender, 
sticking on him regardless of his action. The more liberal philosophy of coaching the 
double team calls for the double team to convert to a combo block if the defender 
stunts away from the hole—across the face of the post blocker. 
Diagram 5-29: A strict interpretation of the double team concept calls for the seal 
blocker to stick on the defensive linemen, even if he stunts inside.

| believe that a strict interpretation of the double team is a waste of a blocker. If a 
defensive lineman stunts across the face of a post blocker, the seal blocker will 
Stay on his vertical path and go up on the linebacker. | feel that an appropriate 
emphasis on the proper footwork and proper run-blocking demeanor can provide any 
team with a legitimate opportunity to successfully pick up any defensive game

With the exception of the single-minded focus on obtaining maximum vertical 
movement of the defender, the double-team blockers execute their technique In 
exactly the same manner as the combo blockers. Among the shared coaching points 
of the double team and combo block are the following:

FOLD. BLOCK 
The fold block may be an inside fold block or an outside fold block. Most offensive 
coaches give the two-fold block techniques different names. Even more coaches 
identify each individual fold blocking combination with a specific name. An example 
of a terminology system that assigns individual names to each of the fold blocking 
combination is shown in Chart 95-1. 
Chart 5-1: A sample terminology system for various fold blocking combinations. 
Fold. A center-guard fold block; the center down blocks backside and 
the guard loops around the center's tail. 
Gut. An inside guard-tackle fold block; the guard fan blocks outward 
and the tackle loops around the guard's tail. 
Tag. An outside guard-tackle fold block; the tackle blocks down and 
the guard loops around the tackle’s tail. 
Tom. An inside tackle/tight end fold block; the tackle fan blocks 
outward and the tight end loops around the tackles tail.

and the tackle loops around the tight end's tail.

The fold block involves two adjacent linemen executing separate techniques with 
regard to a couple of factors—whether the fold block is an outside fold or an inside 
fold and whether the particular player is positioned on the inside or the outside of 
the tandem. The inside fold block is characterized by a fan block outward by the 
inside player. On the inside fold block, the outside blocker is responsible for looping 
around behind the inside blocker to get into position to drive block the linebacker. 
Keeping the shoulders square is an important coaching point for the loop blocker. 
Proper footwork allows the loop blocker to keep his shoulders square as he “rounds 
the horn” underneath on the linebacker. 

On an inside fold block, the proper footwork for a loop blocker involves him taking a 
drop step with his outside foot. The drop step is made to the inside as the blocker 
momentarily crosses his feet. He immediately follows with his inside foot stepping 
back to regain a good base. After the second step, the loop blocker is facing the line 
of scrimmage with his shoulders square. At that point, he is positioned two big 
steps behind the line of scrimmage. The loop blocker is then able to read both the 
outward movement of the fan blocker and the filling action of the linebacker. Upon 
stepping backward with his inside foot, the loop blocker immediately drives off his 
outside foot to drive block the linebacker with a proper run-blocking demeanor. The 
loop blocker should attempt to fit closely off the tail of the fan blocker to junction 
the linebacker. The junction point of the linebacker's path is usually closely related 
to the backfield flow of the play. You should take care to include a simulation of the 
linebacker's expected flow when practicing the fold block. Inside fold blocks are 
normally used with dive plays which exhibit some form of counter action. 
On an outside fold block, the proper footwork for a loop blocker involves him taking 
a drop step with his inside foot. The drop step is made to the outside as the blocker 
momentarily crosses his feet. He immediately follows with his outside foot stepping 
back to regain a good base. After the second step, the loop blocker is facing the line 
of scrimmage with his shoulders square at a depth of two big steps behind the line 
of scrimmage. The loop blocker is then able to read both the down block and the 
filling action of the linebacker. Upon stepping backward with his inside foot, the 
loop blocker immediately drives off his inside foot to drive block the linebacker with 
a good run-blocking demeanor. He should attempt to fit closely to the tail of the 
down blocker as he rounds the horn to junction the linebacker. The junction point of 
the linebacker's path is usually closely related to the backfield flow of the play. You 
should take care to include a simulation of the linebacker's expected flow when 
practicing the fold block. Outside fold blocks are normally used with stretch plays 
designed to hit off tackle or outside the end. 
INSIDE ZONE BLOCK 
The inside zone blocking combination is an area blocking scheme which seals off the 
backside pursuit. It involves two adjacent lineman blocking an area in tandem—one 
blocker acting as a frontside blocker and one blocker acting as a backside blocker. 
The frontside blocker of an inside zone combination sets to drive with the foot 
nearest the defender. His primary objective is to maintain playside leverage on the 
down defender as he fits tightly with his backside flipper in contact with the 
defender. He should avoid being caught up with the defender, yet maintain pressure 
against the defender as he works up to the next level.

Diagram 5-38: The inside-zone zone block by the frontside guard and the center 
versus an onset nose technique. 
Maintaining pressure on the defender with the backside flipper is called “hanging” 
on the defender. The hanging technique is the basic technique of the frontside 
blocker of the inside zone. The backside blocker can be alerted to the frontside 
blocker’s use of the hanging technique by the “I'm hanging” call of the frontside 
blocker. The frontside guard makes an “I’m hanging” call when the linebacker is 
aligned away from the playside. The linebacker may be stacked or offset away from 
the call as shown in Diagrams 5-39 and 5-40. 
If the linebacker Is aligned over the frontside blocker, the frontside blocker will 
make a “zone” call to backside blocker. The zone call tells the backside blocker that 
he has the defensive lineman without any help. The point to remember is that the 
frontside blocker cannot afford to hang on the down defender if the linebacker is 
aligned on the playside of the down defender. The zone call results in both blockers 
setting to reach the playside shoulder of the defenders. Instead of the emphasis 
being on the vertical movement of the down defender as with the “I’m hanging” call, 
the emphasis is placed on cutting off the defender’s pursuit. 
The inside zone block technique resuits in a moving wall which mows down the 
backside pursuit. It is an excellent combination scheme to create a cutback running 
lane between the tackles. With the exception of the “zone” call, vertically moving 
(i.e., knock him off the ball) the down defender is the primary objective of the inside 
zone combination. Key coaching points for the inside zone blocking combination

OUTSIDE ZONE BLOCK 
An outside zone block is a two-man reach block characterized by a frontside blocker 
and a backside blocker. The outside zone block is by definition an onside blocking 
technique that has two independent parts—an outside blocker (i.e., frontside 
blocker) and an inside blocker (i.e., backside blocker). Actually, the outside zone 
block is a five-man block, because when one offensive lineman has an outside zone

Stee, 
block as his rule, all the other offensive linemen typically have the zone block as 
their playside rule. An excellent blocking technique for quick-hitting flank plays (e.g., 
toss sweeps, stretch, etc.), the outside zone block is normally used at the point of 
attack along with a massive backside moving wall sweeping over and up to the side 
of the play. 
To perform an outside zone block, the onside offensive lineman should set to reach. 
Setting to reach involves the blocker pushing off his inside foot and taking a set to 
reach step with his outside foot. The second step is made through the crotch of the 
defender as the blocker rips his inside arm across the defender's chest. He can use 
his inside arm to rip with the flipper and secure the fit against the defender. The 
outside zone blocker’s objective is to initially overtake the defender in width. The 
outside zone blocker can then ride the outside shoulder of the defender as he works 
up to the next level. The blocker should use his inside arm and hand to prevent the 
defender from grabbing the blocker and pulling him to the ground. 
The technique of the block usually depends upon the defensive front structure. For 
example; when the right guard recognizes a 30 defense, he faces a man over him. 
The guard also recognizes that the 30 defensive structure places a man on the 
adjacent tackle. (Note: “Over” identifies a defender as a linebacker; “On” identifies 
the defender as a lineman.) 
To execute the outside zone against the 30 defensive front structure, the right 
guard should set to reach and read the defensive tackle’s reaction. If the outside 
play is called at the most opportune time, the 4 technique defensive tackle will be

attacks on a direct line to the outside eye of the guard; whereas a sparking 4 
technique attacks with an over-and-up move, with the defender keeping his 
shoulders square as he slides upward through the “B” gap. 
The offensive guard's first step should be made to one of two landmarks. When 
expecting an angle charge by the defensive tackle, the guard should step to the 
tighter landmark (i.e., the tackle’s near foot). When expecting a sparking tackle or a 
reading tackle, the guard should step to the outside foot of the tackle. In summary, 
the wider the defensive tackle’s alignment, the wider the landmark should be. The

key to the first step is tied to the backside zone blocker's head placement. When 
performing the outside zone block from an inside position of a blocking tandem, the 
blocker should attempt to get his outside earhole to the inside hip of the teammate. 
For example, the guard should attempt to get his outside earhole to the tackle’s 
inside hip. 
Once the offensive guard takes off to this landmark, he may adjust his angle upfield 
to gain leverage on an inside stunting defender. Putting his near ear to the near hip 
of the outside teammate guarantees that the backside blocker can achieve outside 
leverage against the man aligned on the outside man. 
The second step of the backside blocker‘is critical to achieving success against the 
inside stunting defensive lineman. Against an inside stunting defender, the backside 
portion of the zone should angle off his second step. Angling off the inside step 
entails the blocker adjusting the angle of his inside step to secure the proper fit and 
establish the correct run-blocking demeanor. If the defender sparks inside, the 
guard takes a flatter second step as he slides outside with his shoulders parallel to 
the line of scrimmage. Working to keep the shoulders parallel and securing outside 
leverage are the keys to successfully outside zone blocking the sparking defender. 
If the defender is angling inside on a direct path to the backside blocker’s original 
alignment, the blocker’s second step should strike more upfield. If the play is run to 
the wide hole, the backside blocker can simply run through the outside shoulder of 
the angling defender. To run through the angle-stunting defender, the backside 
blocker drives his inside shoulder through the outside shoulder of the stunting 
defender. Generally, the backside blocker’s back foot should always step on or near 
a 45-degree angle toward the defender aligned on the outside teammate. 
Diagram 5-45: The backside blocker drives his backside shoulder through the 
playside shoulder of the sparking defender. 

Diagram 5-46: The backside blocker drives his backside shoulder through the 
playside shoulder of the slanting defender and continues to the next level. 
lf an offensive guard is to properly read a 4 technique’s reaction to the outside zone 
combination, he must focus on the near foot of the 4 technique. If the foot points 
toward the blocker, the blocker knows that the defensive tackle is stunting inside. A 
veteran offensive guard can read the point of the foot. If the defensive tackle steps 
to the inside, but keeps his toe pointed forward, he is running a spark. If the 
defensive tackle steps to the inside and points his toe on angle toward the guard, 
the defensive tackle is running an angle stunt inside. If the defender is playing a read 
technique, his near foot will step away from the guard, and his toe will point to the 
outside. 
Upon reading the defender’s toe pointing to the outside, the backside blocker can 
continue on his hook-shaped path upfield. The backside blocker's outside shoulder 
should rub against the frontside blocker's inside shoulder as the two work outside 
and upfield as a tandem. Once the tandem is formed, the backside blocker can 
immediately feel the defensive tackle’s reaction to the frontside blocker’s set to 
reach. If the defensive tackle fights hard to the outside, the defender’s near hip will 
disappear across the face of the frontside blocker. In this case, the backside blocker 
will have no blocking surface to secure on the defender. The backside blocker will 
then continue upfield on his hook-shaped path to angle off and cut down the second 
level defender—the linebacker. 
If the defender’s near hip doesn't disappear, the backside blocker will feel an 
available blocking surface as the defender hangs on the frontside blocker. When the 
defensive tackle hangs on the frontside blocker, the backside blocker should push 
the frontside blocker off the tandem zone block and secure the fit to the outside hip 
and shoulder of the defensive tackle.

The backside blocker secures the fit to the defender’s outside by using his inside 
hand to grab the defender’s chest and to pinch the defender into a secure fit 
between the blocker’s head and backside shoulder. In this manner, the outside zone 
block evolves from various one-man blocks along the line of scrimmage to a true 
two-man blocking scheme. 
For an inside blocker who is reach blocking a man on his teammate, the components 
of an effective outside zone block include the backside blocker’s responsibility to 
accomplish the following tasks: 
e 
Set to reach. 
e 
Throw the inside arm through the defender's crotch. 
e 
Dip the inside shoulder to get the pad under the defender’s pad. 
e 
Read the near foot of the defender to determine if he is penetrating. 
e 
Get the ear to the near hip of the outside teammate. 
e 
Work upfield as part of an inside tandem against a floating defensive lineman. 
¢ 
Keep the outside shoulder free and the inside shoulder fitted to the playside hip 
of the defender. 
On the outside zone, the frontside blocker who faces a defender playing onhim will 
step to reach according to the width of the defender’s alignment. If the defender is 
an inside shade, the blocker will set to reach with a vertical step (i.e., up the field). 
Versus an inside shaded defender, the frontside blocker will step his outside foot to 
a point just outside of the defender’s outside foot. He will keep the toes of his 
Outside foot pointing upfield as he steps to reach the inside shade. The blocker will 
then drive his inside shoulder through the outside armpit of the defender. His inside 
arm should be ripped upward in the manner of an uppercut punch. 
The frontside blocker should get his inside arm's bicep under the outside armpit of 
the defender. Getting the bicep to this position lifts the outside shoulder of the 
defender. This punch knocks the defender’s outside shoulder backward while 
simultaneously tilting both of the defender’s shoulders. The tilt of the shoulders is 
caused by the upward thrust of the uppercut punch and the resulting lift of the 
outside shoulder. The shoulder tilt and the backward push of the outside shoulder 
result in the defender's chest opening. By opening the defender’s chest, the 
frontside blocker gives the backside blocker an improved blocking surface—a 
surface conducive to the proper fit of the backside blocker's head as he attempts to 
get around for outside leverage. This component of opening the defender’s 
shoulders is crucial to the two-man dimension of zone blocking the inside shaded 
defender. 

. 
A common error of the frontside blocker in the two-man zone tandem block is 
overstriding the set to reach. If the frontside blocker steps too wide versus the 
inside shaded defensive lineman, the backside blocker cannot properly punch 
through the defender’s armpit. An excessively wide set to reach by the frontside 
blocker creates an unwanted spacing between the backside blocker and frontside 
blocker. Any type of gap or space between the two blockers will give the defender 
a crease through which he may split the two-man zone. The set to reach against the 
inside shaded defensive lineman must be a tight vertical step, only inches outside of 
the defender’s outside foot. 
Once the frontside blocker punches through the armpit of the inside shaded 
defender, he throws his eyes to the second level to find the scraping linebacker. 
Every sound defensive scheme that uses an inside shade defensive lineman will 
Support the inside shade with a fast scraping linebacker. Therefore, the lead blocker 
of the outside zone tandem must be on the lookout for a fast scraping linebacker as 
he rips through the outside pad of the defensive lineman. 
The frontside blocker should flatten his path to the outside as he rips through the 
inside shade. Flattening the path gives the blocker an opportunity to junction the 
scraping linebacker’s outside knee, hip, and shoulder. Once the frontside blocker 
junctions the linebacker’s path, the blocker should explode with his inside shoulder 
pad driving through the backer’s thigh and hip. The key to obtaining the proper fit at 
the junction point is for the blocker to regain control of his body. When a frontside 
blocker rips through an inside shade, he tends to become prone to overextend his 
power angle and to be slightly forward in his demeanor. He must chop his feet on his 
fourth step—much as he does when he blocks the levels on the backside. (Additional 
information on level blocking is presented in Chapter 4). 
Chopping his fourth and fifth steps allows the blocker to reset his demeanor to gain 
a proper fit at the junction point. Since the junction point usually occurs between 
the sixth and seventh step, the frontside blocker can easily reset his demeanor 
before reaching the junction point. 
The frontside blocker’s failure to chop his strides after clearing the inside shade will 
result in the blocker losing the proper relationship in his path to the junction point. 
Unless he chops his stride, the frontside blocker will either overrun the linebacker 
and allow him to cut underneath or lose outside leverage on the linebacker as he 
scrapes across his face. 
lf the man on the frontside blocker is an outside shade, the set to reach is wider— 
slightly outside the playside shoulder of the lineman. The toe should remain pointed 
straight ahead as the blocker sets to reach. On his second step, the blocker should 
punch his inside arm through the chest/armpit of the lineman. The inside arm will 
uppercut through the chest/armpit of the defender as the frontside blocker plants 
his attack step (i.e., second step). The third step should secure outside leverage as 

the frontside blocker works to gain width and depth. The outside shaded defender 
will likely attempt to fight to the outside in an attempt to keep his outside arm and 
leg free. The blocker should use his inside hand to grab cloth and pull himself to 
obtain the proper fit. If the defender continues to fight across the frontside 
blocker’s face, the blocker should maintain contact on the defender while working 
up through the first level to the second level.

Diagram 5-51: The frontside blocker is shown letting the linebacker cross his face. 
Once the blocker enters the second level, he can push off the defensive lineman to 
flatten his path. Flattening his path gives the frontside blocker an opportunity to 
make a second block on a shuffling linebacker. If a linebacker doesn’t show, the 
blocker should continue flattening his path so that he can junction the path of a 
third-level defender such as a free safety. 
Riding the defensive lineman’s outside shoulder through level one and flattening his 
path to cut a second- or third-level defender are ideal objectives for the frontside 
zone blocker. It is more important, however, that the frontside zone blocker never 
allow the outside shaded defender to fight outside to regain the outside leverage. If 
a frontside zone blocker can overtake the outside shade defender and maintain 
outside leverage, the likelihood of offensive success is relatively high. If you give 
credit to the opponent's defensive coaching staff, this outcome is probably the best 
outcome you can hope for as an offensive line coach. 
For the frontside blocker of the outside zone blocking tandem, the components of 
an effective outside zone block include the blocker’s responsibility to accomplish 
the following tasks: 
e 
Set to reach. 
e 
Uppercut punch the inside arm through the chest/armpit of the defender. 
e 
Gain ground with the attack step through the chest/armpit. 
e 
Accomplish the objective of the three-inch rule and obtain a vertical push on the 
defender. 

e 
Continue to work outside and upfield as the blocker moves through the second 
level. 
e 
Release and flatten to junction a second level defender as he enters the second 
level. 
e 
Chop his feet and widen his base as he enters the second level to regain the 
proper run-blocking demeanor and cut the linebacker. 
¢ 
Continue flattening to the outside to junction a third level if the second level 
defender doesn't show. 
For the frontside blocker who is performing an outside zone block against a man 
overhim (i.e., linebacker), the blocker must set to reach just as he would set to reach 
against a wider down technique defender. A linebacker naturally has a greater 
opportunity to flow on the snap prior to the frontside blocker reaching him. 
Therefore, the blocker must take the proper path after setting to reach. The proper 
path against a linebacker is a path that allows the frontside blocker to 
progressively close toward the linebacker while maintaining a tight outside leverage 
fit to the movement of the linebacker. Maintaining a tight fit to the linebacker's 
movement prevents the blocker from overextending his angle, thereby allowing the 
linebacker to plant and slip underneath the block. 
The blocker’s path to the junction point starts with a movement that is sometimes 
referred to as a J-step. The J-step terminology has its roots in the letter’s 
resemblance to the desired path of outside zone blocker as it is drawn ona 
chalkboard.

The set to reach is a lateral step that provides some upfield momentum into the 
neutral zone. After the set to reach, the blocker should move in a near vertical angle 
as he proceeds to the junction point. It is imperative that the frontside blocker keep 
his eyes on the linebacker at all times as he moves toward the junction point. If the 
linebacker bucket-steps, the threat of the linebacker slipping underneath the J-step 
is eliminated. As a result, the blocker may angle off his path slightly to intercept the 
bucket-stepping linebacker. If the linebacker steps sharply into the line of 
scrimmage as he reads the play, the frontside blocker should keep his shoulders 
Square and work up the field on a vertical path, thus preventing the linebacker from 
attempting to slip underneath. 
Once the frontside blocker reaches the 
junction point, he should deliver a sharp 
blow through the linebacker's playside thigh and hip. As described previously, the 
blocker should drive his inside pad through the linebacker’s outside leg and hip. The 
blocker must take care to chop his steps and widen his base as he approaches the 
junction point. It is also important that the blocker snap his head upward as he 
delivers the blow through the linebacker’s hip. Novice offensive linemen often 
neglect to snap their heads upward as they attempt to block a moving linebacker. In 
reality, it is natural for a blocker to attempt to look at the ground as he attempts to 
cut a linebacker. When a blocker looks at the ground, he usually fails to deliver a 
low-to-high blow, striking downward instead. Snapping the head up also helps the 
blocker to keep his back flat as he cuts the linebacker. Snapping the head up, 
keeping a flat back, and a delivering a low-to-high shoulder blow are crucial 
elements of being able to effectively blocking a linebacker who is on the move.
