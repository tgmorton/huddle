If necessity
 has been the mother of invention throughout the history of professional football, it could also be said that desperation is the father. It’s entirely rare for any football innovation to occur without an owner, general manager, coach, group of players, or single player up against the wall and looking for a way to succeed. The schematic history of the pro game can be broken down into a series of if-this, then-that scenarios, in which one opponent had the upper hand, and another opponent created a mismatch more through a resoundingly original concept than through the improvement of personnel. Especially in-season, the improvement of personnel is a tough proposition. Generally speaking, one either has the horses to make it go or one does not. And when one does not, there is a base necessity for innovation.

I could give all kinds of examples, but for in-season desperation, it’s tough to beat the circumstances that brought the Wildcat formation into NFL prominence. The 2008 Miami Dolphins had a rookie head coach in Tony Sparano, a first-year quarterbacks coach in David Lee, and a veteran quarterback in Chad Pennington who was intelligent but relatively noodle-armed. Sparano had replaced Cam Cameron, who led the 2007 Dolphins to a franchise-worst 1–15 mark. The 2008 Dolphins didn’t start out much better, losing their season opener to the New York Jets by a 20–14 mark and getting trounced by the Arizona Cardinals 31–10 in Week 2. 

It was on the plane home from University of Phoenix Stadium that the Dolphins—in a fit of desperation—did what so many teams before them did: they threw out the traditional NFL paradigm, said, “To hell with it,” and let invention carry the day. Sparano talked with Lee and asked him to detail the Wildcat formations Lee had used as the Arkansas Razorbacks offensive coordinator the year before. In a nutshell the Wildcat had three basic plays, and each had a running back taking the snap from center and the quarterback flanked wide right.

The running back then blasts off to the right behind a pulling left guard, an unbalanced offensive line, and an H-back either between and behind the two right tackles or just outside the right tackle to block.

That was the idea anyway. The Dolphins knew that they were too undermanned to beat teams head-to-head and, with the underwhelming Ted Ginn and Greg Camarillo as their leading receivers that season, they weren’t going to outgun anyone through the air. So they turned instead to a series of option plays that go back decades in their various iterations and decided to debut them against the New England Patriots. New England head coach Bill Belichick has seen just about every offense and defense there is, and his defenses are known for their flexibility and versatility. But against three basic option plays, that multiple and disciplined defense was left gasping for air. “When they get settled, they’re pretty fundamentally sound as a defense,” said Miami running back Ronnie Brown, who ran for a franchise-record four touchdowns in the game as the Wildcat’s point man. “So we wanted to give them something to adjust to.”

That they did, and the normally uber-disciplined Patriots were aghast that they were helpless to stop such a simple series of concepts in a 38–13 loss that set the Dolphins on a path to a highly unlikely AFC East title. “I don’t know why in the world we couldn’t stop that play. They just came in and beat our butts,” Patriots safety Rodney Harrison said. “You’ve got a bitter taste in your mouth. The only way to get rid of that bitterness is to come in and work hard. You get bitter and you get better.”

Getting bitter is a natural response to adversity; getting better has its base in the ability to see beyond a problem that has been created through whatever circumstance. Perhaps the most famous adaptation to adversity in NFL history is what happened after Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Greg Cook suffered a severe shoulder injury in his rookie season of 1969. The fifth overall pick in the 1969 AFL-NFL draft out of Cincinnati, Cook was widely regarded as having the potential to be one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history. The Bengals’ offensive coordinator at the time, Bill Walsh, was charged with getting Cook ready for the pro game right away. It didn’t take long for things to unravel dramatically. Tackled on his throwing shoulder in the third game of his NFL career by Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jim Lynch, Cook tore his rotator cuff in the process. He took cortisone shots and played through the pain, but there was no surgery that would bring him back to full strength like there is now. He finished his rookie campaign with 106 completions in 197 attempts for 1,854 yards, 15 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and had the first in a series of surgeries after the season. Doctors were also contending with the fact that Cook had a partially detached biceps muscle, and Cook attempted a grand total of three passes in the remainder of his NFL career. Cook led the AFL in completion percentage, passer rating, and yards per attempt in 1969, proving that even as a halfway broken rookie quarterback he had special skills. But none of that mattered now. 

With the knowledge that Cook would be out for the 1970 season, Walsh and head coach Paul Brown had to make do with Virgil Carter, who had completed a total of 143 passes in two seasons with the Chicago Bears before the Bengals acquired him. Carter was a journeyman at best. But he’s an important footnote in football history in that his limitations forced Walsh to create entirely new concepts for his team. “Carter was able to go through his progressions quickly and throw on the go, not blessed with a big arm, but accurate,” 
Sports Illustrated’
s Paul Zimmerman wrote in 2001. “So, Walsh crafted an offense to suit him, a horizontal offense with a lot of motion and underneath routes and breakoff patterns, an attack that now goes by the misnomer ‘West Coast Offense.’”

It was a misnomer because the offense that Walsh later made famous in San Francisco was created in the Midwest, but that’s of little consequence. Walsh had a vision that included shorter passes—essentially, using the passing game as a rushing attack much of the time—and a series of advanced route concepts that almost always left a man open against any defense. And in an era when quarterback mobility was seen by most as a glaring negative, Walsh had Carter roll out of the pocket—not to gain rushing yards
, 
but to open throwing lanes and buy time for route concepts to open. 

It worked from the start, and the rest, of course, is history. Carter had completed less than 50 percent of his passes with the Bears, but he led the NFL in completion percentage in 1971 with a 62.2 mark. Soon after the Bengals selected Ken Anderson out of tiny Augustana College in Ohio in the third round of the 1971 draft, Walsh discovered that Anderson possessed the intelligence, mobility, and ability to work within the structure required by this new offense. In a career that ended in 1986, Anderson led the NFL in completion percentage three times, passing yardage twice, yards per attempt twice, and passer rating four times. His success in Cincinnati went far beyond Walsh’s tenure there—Walsh lost a power struggle with Brown after the 1975 season—but the concepts were the same. After a year with the San Diego Chargers as an assistant and two more at Stanford as the head coach, Walsh went on to perfect his system with an underrated quarterback named Joe Montana at the helm. Back when the NFL was paraded around as a game of power running with occasional long passes mixed in, Walsh was derided for his offense at the start. “When what is now known as the ‘West Coast Offense’ was being developed, it was summarily dismissed by many people as nothing more than ‘nickel and dime,’” Walsh wrote in his seminal book, 
Finding the Winning Edge, 
in 1997. “They argued that, as an offensive system, the West Coast Offense was developed out of a ‘desperate’ attempt by a team to counteract its lack of overpowering personnel. History has shown that these individuals were glaringly mistaken.”

Well, that’s a bit of revisionist history, and his detractors weren’t entirely wrong, though they missed the point in this case. Walsh said more than once that had Cook stayed healthy, the Bengals would have thrown the ball deep more because of Cook’s ability to do that at a very special level. Walsh had to counteract a lack of talent at his most important position and he did have to re-scheme his offense out of desperation to a degree. Where Walsh differentiated himself from the rank and file was in his comprehensive understanding of how his system could not only beat the game, but also revolutionize it—and how to pass that understanding along to his players. “Teams, which attempt to adopt the West Coast Offense and to duplicate its success solely by copying the schematics and the blocking schemes, are taking a fragmented approach to installing such a system,” he wrote. “In order to fully understand the West Coast Offense, a number of factors concerning the parameters of the system must be considered.”

Walsh then went into some of those parameters, including the schematic complexity his players could reasonably handle; whether the scope of the offense is appropriate to a team’s specific personnel; the requirements for installing the system; the practical application of the offense on gamedays; the adjustments in assignments, techniques, and schemes required through a game; and the defensive alignments and schemes most applicable to beat various offenses. 

In the end the difference between the Wildcat and the West Coast Offense was diversity. Although the Wildcat had just a handful of base concepts that could be expanded upon to various degrees (which is why it petered out of the NFL in a few short years), the West Coast Offense embodied an entirely new way of seeing the game. Sparano and Lee were bailing out of a sinking boat; Walsh was building a new breed of ship. But each innovation came from luck and desperation—whether their inventors preferred to admit it or not after the fact—and given the ways in which the NFL has expanded as a schematic entity, that’s absolutely par for the course. 

Yes, there had been precedents to a short passing game that stretched the field in different ways, but it took Walsh to put it all together in ways that revolutionized the NFL, thus forcing opposing defensive coordinators to invent their own counter-checks and checkmates. And yes, there had been all kinds of option offenses run at varying levels of success through the league’s history, but it took these three plays to upend one of the smartest football coaches ever to walk the Earth.

The T Formation forced the defenses of the old 7-Diamond and 6-2-2-1 to adapt to the 5-3-2-1. Halfbacks catching passes caused a change to the Eagle and Stack Defenses. More complex passing formations led to the Umbrella and 4-3 defenses, and extra receivers led to the advent of nickel and zone defenses. Personnel realities and the constant need for innovation led to the rise of the 3-4 defense. The West Coast Offense had teams taking a closer look at the zone blitz and the 46 Defenses. Multiple defensive fronts were created to counter more complex offenses, and the game today reflects a schematic diversity never seen before. 

As former NFL quarterback and current ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski wrote in 
The Games That Changed the Game
, “Today, defenses must be ready for exotic personnel changes on every snap. Defenses of old were four down linemen, three linebackers, and four defensive backs. Now, you can have three linemen, five linemen, or no linemen. You can have two guys with their hands on the ground or four with their hands on the ground. One play later, you get no one with his hand on the ground! You can have five defensive backs, or six, or even eight! That’s 20
th
 century football.”

Not to mention 21
st
 century football. And whether these concepts are long-lasting or short-form transitions, they form the history of professional football that goes beyond—and to a degree underneath—the game we see in the current era on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays. In this book we’ll examine the NFL’s history of schematic innovation and detail the work of a great many gifted—and desperate—men.
