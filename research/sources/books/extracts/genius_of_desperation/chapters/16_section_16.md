Praise for “The Genius of Desperation”

“Doug Farrar is my favorite NFL writer. I always look forward to reading Doug’s work because of his dedication as well as the massive amount of research he conducts for all of his projects. His love for football and his proclivity for preparation have never been more evident than in 
The Genius of Desperation
, in which Doug explains the design of many of the great innovations in football tactics, as well as who created them, and where, and why.”

—Tony Khan, Jacksonville Jaguars senior vice president of football administration and technology

“If you love football—whether you have been in it your entire life or are a fan who appreciates the chess match of the game—you must read this book.”	
—Joe Banner, former Philadelphia Eagles 	president and Cleveland Browns CEO

“Irrespective of your level of knowledge and understanding of the game of football, you will benefit from and enjoy reading this book. It’s a book that can serve as a tome, if you will. It can and should sit on the office shelf of many.” 

—Amy Trask, CBS Sports/former CEO of the Oakland Raiders

“As someone who knows Paul Zimmerman well, I can tell you Dr. Z would love this book.” 	
—Peter King, NBC Sports

“If you’re a football geek, this book is for you. If you’re a fan of good writing and journalism, this book is also for you.”

—Mike Freeman, Bleacher Report

“I have never read a sports book that does such a seamless job of synthesizing statistics and the personalities who bring the numbers to life. In a series of vignettes that span NFL history, Farrar shows how desperation is the true mother of invention.”

—Dave Zirin, sports editor for 
The Nation
