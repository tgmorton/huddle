2. The Game Comes of Age: The NFL in the 1950s

“Boy, this is gonna be one terrific day, so you better live it up because tomorrow you’ll be nothing.”

Rebel Without a Cause

Philadelphia Eag
les coach Earle “Greasy” Neale had already opened up the structure of NFL defenses by moving to a four defensive back system, taking linemen and line­backers out of the formation to better counter the increase in passing numbers. But when the Cleveland Browns came into the NFL in 1950, they immediately made a serious statement by beating Neale’s defense with several of Paul Brown’s innovations—the passing pocket, the draw play, and short passes to the side to control the ball. Brown made a superstar out of quarterback Otto Graham and was the NFL’s first real modern-age coach. Many of his inventions—the applied use of game film, the first true college scouting network, and the first complex playbooks—are still in effect today in full but with technologically superior versions.

The New York Giants used several different concepts to deal with these more explosive offenses. Head coach Steve Owen used more defensive backs and linebackers who could drop back into coverage. Then, the team hired two able assistants—Vince Lombardi as the team’s offensive coordinator and Tom Landry as the team’s defensive coordinator—in 1954. Lombardi’s schematic innovations will be covered more in the 1960s chapter, but Landry’s application of the 4-3 defense turned the Madison Avenue Giants into the first team with a defense that was well-known to the general public. 

As the decade ended, one renegade coach proved to be decades ahead of his time with the implementation of a formation that would become the NFL’s primary quarterback placement in 2017 and beyond.

Paul Brown

The playbook as it stands today. The coaching staff. The draw play. Dropback pass blocking. The face mask. Studying game film to understand and exploit opponent tendencies and weaknesses. The elimination of pro football’s color barrier. The list of inno­vations brought to pro football by Paul Brown is unmatched, especially in the postwar era, which is why his .672 winning percentage in 25 years of coaching in the pro game tells only half the story. “There’s nobody in the game that I have more respect for than Paul Brown. His contributions from the game to the way it’s played, to protective equipment and the playbook, every film breakdown, every meeting,” Bill Belichick said in 
A Football Life: Paul Brown
. “Fifty years later, we’re all still basically doing the same thing.” 

Had he just been a great schematic mind, Brown would still have been an easy Hall of Famer based on the results—a 213–104–9 mark with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals, all four championships in the history of the All-America Football Conference, and three NFL championships with the Cleveland Browns—not to mention his ability to make the expansion Bengals competitive soon after their entry into the American Football League in 1968. 

Wherever he coached, Brown was a success, and it was primarily because he saw ways to do things that no other coach could. He started at Massillon High in Ohio and at Ohio State and took the head coaching position with the Browns of the All-America Football Conference in February of 1945. 
Chicago Tribune
 sports editor Arch Ward proposed the league the year before, and Brown was offered $17,500 per year to coach the Cleveland team—more than any other football coach at any level. Brown also received an ownership stake in the team and a stipend as his military time was winding down; he had served as the coach of the Great Lakes Naval Training Station team in 1944 and put up a 9–2–1 record. 

The Browns were the AAFC’s dominant force. Their four championships included an undefeated season in 1948. Brown brought several future Hall of Famers to the Browns, including quarterback Otto Graham, running back Marion Motley, and tackle/kicker Lou Groza and refined his search for talent among those players he had coached and become aware of during his Massillon and Ohio State days. The league folded in part because the Browns were so clearly the class of the league, and after the 1949 season, the Browns, Baltimore Colts, and San Francisco 49ers entered the National Football League. Brown finally had a chance to ply his trade against the best in the business. 

The 1950 Browns showed just how far ahead of everyone else Brown really was. In one season he took down the two-time NFL champions, maneuvered his way around the origins of a new defense that would become the league’s standard for the next three decades after his offense had helped to force its creation, and took down the most prolific offensive team in the league’s history in the NFL championship game. Overall, not a bad little season. It started with one of the greatest upsets in NFL history.

Week 1, 1950: Cleveland Browns 35, Philadelphia Eagles 10

NFL commissioner Bert Bell wasted no time in setting up a stern test for the new kids. The four-time AAFC champs began their NFL journey with an opener against the two-time NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles, a tough, old-school team with a dynamic rushing attack led by Steve Van Buren and a defense that had shut out the Los Angeles Rams in the previous championship game 14–0. The Eagles had allowed the fewest points and scored the most in 1949, so this game was a clear message to the best team in the AAFC: you may have been a big fish in a small pond, but the NFL is the ocean. “If you could feel cocky before a game, we felt cocky,” Eagles running back Bosh Pritchard told NFL Films. “This was a team from what we thought was maybe a bush league…but they weren’t.”

According to Pritchard, Eagles head coach Earle “Greasy” Neale didn’t scout the Cleveland Browns before the game. He apparently thought Paul Brown was little more than a high school coach and that the Eagles wouldn’t have to do much to beat Brown’s team. “I played for Greasy for quite a few years,” quarterback Tommy Thompson said. “He made very, very few mistakes, but I believe he made a mistake on [not] scouting this ballclub.” 

Well-schooled in motivational tactics, Brown used pregame articles debasing his team’s readiness to face the Eagles as bulletin board material. “That was our motivation,” Browns running back Marion Motley said. “When we got to Philadelphia, reading [these] newspaper[s] for two weeks, we were ready to hit anything the Eagles had.” 

The Eagles shouldn’t have been oblivious to Brown’s strategy, which was made quite public. The 
September 7, 1950, edition
 of 
The Philadelphia Inquirer
 had a story from sports reporter Frank O’Gara, who spoke with “an unusually unreliable source, who doesn’t wish to be identified.” This source, or O’Gara himself, posited that “the Clevelanders are of the opinion that quick passes, chiefly of the hook variety, will riddle the Eagles’ revolving defense and set up victory in the long-awaited football classic.”

Brown’s gameplan was indeed to rattle Neale’s defenses with flare passes to his backs and deep passes down the sidelines. Neale, Philadelphia’s head coach since 1941, had devised his “Eagle” defense through the 1940s with a five-man line, two linebackers, and the first four-man secondary. It worked well enough against NFL offenses, but Brown had done the scouting Neale hadn’t. He theorized that if he expanded the offensive line spacings and put his halfbacks in motion and out to catch passes to either sideline, Neale’s linebackers would have to move out of the middle of the field. Brown had tried this a bit against the Detroit Lions in the preseason “only briefly so as not to tip our hand,” said Brown in 
PB: The Paul Brown Story
, “but each time their defense reacted as we had hoped.” Sending left halfback Alex Bumgardner in motion to pull a linebacker out of the middle was a key component of this strategy.

This left a huge middle gap wide open for slants and crossing patterns. Brown also implemented a double-wing formation with two receivers to one side, forcing single coverage from Neale’s defensive backs. Brown cited one mismatch in particular—Eagles cornerback Russ Craft trying to cover halfback Dub Jones one-on-one. 

The second part of the Browns’ strategy showed just how clinical Brown could be when diagnosing an opponent’s personnel and strategies. He theorized that since Neale’s defensive linemen were taught to line up outside opposing offensive linemen, moving his offensive linemen farther and farther apart as the game went on would naturally place the defensive linemen farther apart from each other. This would set up Philadelphia’s defensive line for the Motley draw plays by widening the splits and leaving the linebackers alone to deal with Motley at the second level—not a pleasant proposition for any linebacker. Motley ran 11 times for 48 yards, becoming more of a factor in the second half when Brown wanted his offense to control the ball. “I’ll never forget Alex Wojciechowicz looking around for his defensive tackles and suddenly signaling for time out,” Brown wrote. “We could hear him yelling at his tackles to stay close. They made the mistake—as the Lions did—of lining up on our offensive linemen instead of taking their normal spacing from the ball and they never adjusted to it. I couldn’t help thinking back to our first game at Ohio State against Missouri and how we saved the day by keeping our normal spacing.”

Jones ran six times for 72 yards and caught five passes for 98 yards and a touchdown. He was the most obvious personification of a Browns offense that caught the Eagles’ championship defense off guard. Graham completed 21-of-38 passes for 346 yards and three touchdowns, Mac Speedie led all Browns receivers with seven catches for 109 yards and a touchdown, and the Browns had a cakewalk over the NFL champions with a 35–10 score. 

To put that achievement in perspective, imagine if the score of Super Bowl I had been reversed and that the AFL’s Kansas City Chiefs had beaten the NFL’s Green Bay Packers 35–10 and you’d have an idea of just how shocking Cleveland’s win was. The Browns beat their old AAFC rivals, the Baltimore Colts, 31–0 in the second week of the 1950 season, racking up 475 yards of total offense and allowing just 219. Then, it was time to welcome the New York Giants to Cleveland Municipal Stadium in the Browns’ first NFL home game. What awaited them was a defensive wrinkle they didn’t expect. 

Week 3, 1950: New York Giants 6, Cleveland Browns 0

Steve Owen started his NFL career in 1924 as a guard for the Kansas City Blues and then played tackle for the Hartford Blues, Cleveland Bulldogs, and Kansas City Cowboys during the next couple of years before he was sold to the New York Giants for $500 in 1926. This was typical of the NFL’s itinerant roots in 1964. Owen became a co-player/coach in 1930 along with Benny Friedman and was named the singular head coach the next season and guided the Giants for the next 23 years on a handshake agreement with team owner Tim Mara. 

Owen finished his coaching career with a 153–100–17 regular-season mark and a 2–8 playoff record, taking the NFL championship in 1934 and 1938. He was a constant innovator through his career. But the Hall of Famer is perhaps best known for his adjustments to Brown’s defense in 1950 and the creation of the modern defense. He had a great defensive roster that season led by an all-time secondary, which benefited from the AAFC’s dissolution. 

The New York Giants were awarded three defensive backs from the AAFC’s New York Yankees franchise—safety Otto Schnellbacher, who was placed with future Hall-of-Famer Emlen Tunnell, and two cornerbacks: Harmon Rowe and a rangy kid from Mission, Texas, named Tom Landry. Owen and Landry, who had been named defensive captain, developed what would be called “the Umbrella Defense” because the defense opened like an umbrella. It was a combination of the 5-2-4 and the 5-3-3 and it allowed for more flexibility because of the six-man front that had two defensive guards, two defensive tackles, and two defensive ends outside. But the ends were actually linebackers able to either stay at the point of attack or drop into coverage. 

The Browns didn’t complete a single pass in the first half, and Otto Graham completed just 12 passes in 30 attempts for 127 yards, no touchdowns, and three interceptions. Brown’s team experienced its first NFL loss 6–0.

What had beaten Graham and the Browns—despite all their innovations—was the first instance of the 4-3 defense, which would become the NFL’s base defensive formation from the 1950s through the mid-1970s and remains an option for coaches today. It represented Owen’s genius and was the first obvious manifestation of Landry’s historic ability to innovate and communicate schemes to his players. Owen drew the new defense up on the board, handed his chalk to Landry, and told the kid to explain it to his teammates. “They called it the Umbrella Defense because it had the effect of an umbrella opening,” Landry said in 
The Last Cowboy
. “It worked very well. Emlen played next to me. We sort of worked things out on our own on the field. Graham didn’t complete a pass on our defense in the first half. We intercepted three. We had both Speedie and Lavelli double-covered.”

In the second half, Paul Brown tried rolling Graham out and throwing quick passes underneath the ends, who were dropping back. The Giants responded by blitzing their ends and playing tighter coverage with their cornerbacks.

When the two teams met again on October 22, the Giants came out with a base nickel defense—very rare for the period. Owen and Landry played a 5-1-5 set against Brown’s weapons, intercepted three more Graham passes, and became the only team to beat the Browns twice in 1950. In addition to the base nickel concept, Owen had Tunnell play more of a roving defensive halfback position to help coverage to either side based on the alignment and route concepts. It may have been the first example of a free safety on an NFL field and presaged the zone defense, in which players reacted more to areas than opponents.

As the 1950 season went on, Brown started toying with those teams that weren’t unfurling Umbrella Defenses against them. In the December 3 rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles, he wanted to prove a point that his team was more than just an aerial attack. So the Browns didn’t throw a single pass all day and still beat Earle Neale’s team 13–7. The 1950 Browns finished the regular season with a 10–2 record and beat the Giants for the first time in the divisional playoff by an 8–3 score. “This game ranks as the greatest I’ve ever seen, even greater than our opening victory over the Eagles,” Brown wrote, “because of the remarkable array of players—nearly a dozen now in the Hall of Fame aside from many others who belong there—and some of the most astonishing plays ever recorded in pro football history.”

After defeating the Giants, they prepared for their first NFL championship game, and it was against a formidable opponent—the point-a-minute Los Angeles Rams. As Brown also pointed out, the game was a writer’s delight. The Browns were the new kids who had twice beaten the two-time NFL champions through entirely different methods and they were playing a team that had left Cleveland a few years before. Brown’s challenge in this game was to counter a Rams team with two fabulous quarterbacks in Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin and the fastest group of receivers anyone had ever seen. “Five players who could run the 100 in less than 10 seconds,” Brown said.

The story didn’t start well for the Browns. The Rams had Glenn Davis fake a block to force linebacker hesitation, and then Davis shot out of the backfield and up the left sideline. Waterfield hit a wide-open Davis downfield, and he ran untouched into the end zone. With 27 seconds gone in the game, the Rams had their first touchdown, and this looked like it could be a rout.

Cleveland responded with a drive in which Graham ran the ball three times and tied the score with a 27-yard pass to Dub Jones. The two teams traded punches back and forth, but in the end, it was Graham’s efficiency—he completed 22-of-33 passes for 298 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception—that made the difference, while Waterfield threw four interceptions to the Browns’ 5-3-3 base defense. Brown’s team wrapped up their first NFL championship in their first NFL season with a 30–28 victory.

There is no equivalent in league history for what the Browns did in their first NFL year—the newcomers forced every other team to adapt to them. Cleveland played in every league championship game until the 1955 season, winning it all in 1954 and 1955. It was clear that not only did the Browns field a tremendous series of teams, but that Brown himself also had set the pace as the NFL’s prime innovator. 

Brown coached the Browns through the 1962 season. He was fired by owner Art Modell on January 7, 1963. Modell and Brown had gone head-to-head over who ran the team. Brown had enjoyed uncontested decision-making power over strategy and personnel since the AAFC days, but when Modell bought the team in 1961, that started to change. 

Brown returned to the game in 1968 with the expansion Cincinnati Bengals and took his new team to the playoffs in three seasons over an eight-year stretch before retiring as a head coach soon after the 1975 season. Brown stayed with the franchise as team president, helping the Bengals to two Super Bowls in the 1980s. The Bengals lost both of those Super Bowls to the San Francisco 49ers led by Bill Walsh, Brown’s former offensive coordinator. Walsh had a large sense of revenge through those two Super Bowls. (Brown had passed on Walsh for the head coach position in 1976 and allegedly bad-mouthed Walsh throughout the league so he wouldn’t get a similar position elsewhere.) 

That wasn’t uncommon. For all of Brown’s brilliance, he could be autocratic and unfeeling to his players. He came from an era in which players did what they were told without question or argument and endured into an era when that was no longer true. His complicated personal history aside, Brown gave more to pro football than anyone else. More of what he imagined exists in the NFL than any other individual, and that will remain his legacy.

The 4-3 Defense: Sam Huff and the Middle Linebacker as Rock Star

“No single assignment in the field of sport is more demanding than playing a linebacker post in professional football. It requires an almost impossible blend of abilities: size enough to step into a hole in the line and stop a 230-pound fullback head-on, speed enough to cover the league’s fast ends or halfbacks traveling at a full head of steam.” 
Sports Illustrated
’s Tex Maule 
wrote that
 about New York Giants middle linebacker Sam Huff in November of 1958. It speaks
—
to the need for the position in an increasingly complex NFL, the ways in which Tom Landry schemed the position, and how Huff played it
—
that 50 years later everything said then is still true about the modern middle linebacker.

The true 4-3 defense really started when the Giants selected Huff in the third round of the 1956 draft out of West Virginia, and Landry (then the team’s full-time defensive coordinator) saw in Huff the player who would expand his defense beyond the adjustments he and head coach Steve Owen had made earlier in the decade to deal with Paul Brown’s offensive motions and formations. “This new middle linebacker position required a combination of lineman and defensive back abilities,” Landry said in Huff’s 1988 autobiography 
Tough Stuff
. Landry was looking for a player who could stuff the run and move through gaps with the power of the old middle guard but cover running backs and tight ends out of the backfield and off the formation. In addition, as the defensive playcaller on the field, the middle linebacker had to be smart enough to be an extension of his defensive coordinator on the field. 

It was a tall order to be sure, but Huff was perfectly qualified. He had played middle guard in college, and in Huff’s first training camp, the Giants alternated him between his old position and the new. Once he moved back from the line and was able to see the offense more clearly and the entire field more peripherally, the Giants’ defense—and all subsequent NFL defenses—changed immediately. 

Huff was staying with several other players at the Excelsior Hotel in the West Side of Manhattan, and Landry visited Huff frequently to go over concepts to put the pieces together. “That’s how we developed the 4-3 defense.” Huff wrote. “We’d have the inside 4-3 where the defensive tackle would shut off the middle and the linebackers would pursue to the outside or we’d go to the outside 4-3, where the tackle would angle outside, and I would come up the middle or catch the play from behind. All the years we played, that’s all I ever did.” 

Having a point man in the center of the defense solved the problems Brown exploited with his routes across the middle of the field and it opened defensive concepts exponentially over time. As Tampa-2 and Cover-2 defenses developed decades later and nickel defenses became the new normal in the 2000s, the middle linebacker as the position was denoted would decrease in importance. But what Landry and Huff started was a necessary adaptation to the increase in offensive diversity and effectiveness. It was also one of the first of many Landry innovations—from the 1950s through the decades to come—that would make it clear that he was one of pro football’s all-time great thinkers. 

Air Red: Hickey Brings the Shotgun and the Alley-Oop

Howard Wayne “Red” Hickey was one of the most prominent offensive innovators of his time, though he wasn’t much of a motivator as a head coach. As the San Francisco 49ers’ head man from 1959 through 1963, Hickey brought new and effective schemes to his team, and to great effect, but the percentage of players who did not approve of his old-school methods of communication was quite high. “He tore that team apart,” end Gordie Soltau said in 
Founding 49ers: The Dark Days Before the Dynasty
. “He called me in and said, ‘I want you to retire, but I want you to be one of my coaches,’ I told him, ‘I don’t mind you retiring me, but I could never coach for you.’” 

“I had absolutely no respect for him,” said legendary 49ers right tackle Bob St. Clair. “He’d yell and scream at you and everyone else.” St. Clair remembered Hickey being chased around the locker room by running back Joe Perry once, saying that, “Joe was going to beat the hell out of him.” Another time Hickey held up a newspaper, detailing a story in which the player had been named in a paternity suit, saying “St. Clair, you’re a disgrace to the 49ers and you don’t respect me.” 

St. Clair’s response? “You got that half-right.”

But Hickey was responsible for one minor and one major schematic innovation. The minor one was the alley-oop, a jump-ball strategy that made a star out of receiver R.C. Owens. The major one—because it’s the prominent offensive formation in the NFL today—is the shotgun. The Green Bay Packers had used a version of what became the shotgun with a short punt formation years before, but that was more of a trick play unintended to be used on every snap. This was different. Hickey told the players in his sales pitch that the 49ers would use it on every play against the Baltimore Colts’ dominant defense. “We were looking for an equalizer,” Hickey told 
High Point Enterprise
 in 1975. “We had Baltimore coming up and couldn’t match them man-for-man. They had John Unitas, Gino Marchetti…people like that. And we were hurting. Y.A. Tittle was out with an injury. So, I called a team meeting and told the players what we were going to do. They were quiet, thinking the old man had flipped his wig.” 

Hickey premiered his version of the shotgun against the Detroit Lions in the third week of the 1961 season, alternating quarterbacks John Brodie, Billy Kilmer, and Bobby Waters. Hickey implemented some basic option principles with the quarterback either running the ball himself or handing to the back alongside him. The 49ers beat the Los Angeles Rams 35–0 the next week, and even those players who did not get along with Hickey felt that he was obviously on to something. “It was great blocking for it.” St. Clair said. “Hickey would tell us the guard had to be a yard away from the center and the tackle two yards away from the guard. One time in practice, he blew the whistle and came out with a measuring tape, shouting, ‘Don’t move. Don’t move.’ Then he’d tell us we weren’t the right distance apart.” 

Perhaps the pinnacle of Hickey’s short-lived shotgun domination came in a 38–24 Week 5 win against the Minnesota Vikings. Kilmer ran 20 times for 115 yards and four touchdowns. Waters added 60 yards and a rushing touchdown on nine carries. The next week against the Chicago Bears proved to be the shotgun’s undoing—or at least Hickey’s version of it. As St. Clair later recalled, Chicago defensive coordinator Clark Shaughnessy had a fool-proof plan to stop it. “Shaughnessy decided to put two guys over the center, and two guys over the guard.” St. Clair said. “With the shotgun you were one blocker shy, and one of the Bears’ linemen would always get through because there was no one to block him.” 

Bears owner George Halas had come up with this tactic as he reviewed his old playbooks from the 1930s, essentially turning Bill George into a middle guard and creating a blitz package that this shotgun team couldn’t stop. With a few exceptions, the San Francisco shotgun died on October 22, 1961. Hickey used it a few times after that, but he did not develop it further as a schematic concept that could aid his offense. It would take years for the shotgun to return to the NFL and even more time before it was taken seriously. 

The notion of rotating quarterbacks further illustrates the limitations of Hickey’s shotgun. He was deploying his quarterbacks as point men in base option formations, where the quarterback’s ability to throw well at multiple depths and decipher defenses was not as important. For coaches who viewed the quarterback position as the way to undress any defense, rotating men at what was becoming the most important position in football must have seemed to be utter madness.

Back in the AFL days, San Diego Chargers head coach Sid Gillman once prepared his team to use the shotgun against the Buffalo Bills when he became aware that the field at Buffalo’s War Memorial Stadium was going to be a mess. “In my judgement the shotgun is the best formation for slush and mud, which prevent the rushing linemen from gaining traction and getting to your thrower,” Gillman told the 
Terre Haute Tribune
. “If the center can get the ball back accurately, the passer has far more time than he would working from the T [formation].”

But in that game, Gillman saw that his plays from under center were working and scrapped the shotgun, which stayed dormant for the most part until 1975 when Hickey, then a scout for the Cowboys, persuaded Tom Landry to bring it back into vogue. Landry had already tried rotating his quarterbacks in 1962 with Eddie LeBaron and Don Meredith and in 1971 with Craig Morton and Roger Staubach but then reverted to the one-quarterback system both times. He had also used the shotgun years before it became a fundamental part of his offense in the mid-1970s. Landry told the 
Los Angeles Times
 before the 1975 season: “What it does is enable the quarterback to have an extra second or second-and-a-half to read the defense.” 

Landry was open to innovation and had the ability to tinker successfully with schematic concepts that eventually put the shotgun on the right track. Under him and with Staubach as its purveyor, the shotgun became less a schematic conceit and more a way to improve the quarterback’s vision and ability to absorb information. “The spread gives me more freedom, more maneuverability,” Staubach said. “Your ability to see the defense is better, and all your receivers are in position to put quicker pressure on the defense, too.” 

The Cowboys completed 54-of-117 passes for 814 yards, four touchdowns, and five interceptions from the shotgun in 1975. Those aren’t exactly efficient stats, but the 1970s weren’t an efficient time for quarterbacks, and Dallas used the shotgun primarily as a passing-down endeavor, throwing downfield against defenses spread out to defend the pass through multiple zones. The most famous shotgun play of the Cowboys’ 1975 season was Staubach’s 50-yard game-winning touchdown pass to receiver Drew Pearson late in the fourth quarter of Dallas’ 17–14 victory against the Minnesota Vikings in the divisional round of the playoffs. The Cowboys’ version of the shotgun faded away in the late 1970s as Staubach got older—he retired in 1979—and other teams weren’t initially fond of the idea as a base concept. Washington Redskins fans once booed the formation when the Cowboys ran it, and Rams linebacker Isiah Robertson said, “It’s a rinky-dink formation. It’ll catch up to them before the season is over.”

“It’s one of those 50-50 things,” Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworksi told 
The Philadelphia Inquirer
 in 1980. “It has its good points and its bad points. Personally, I enjoy dropping back and looking for receivers. I don’t know how appealing it’s going to be until we get to working with it. The center’s blind snap, that’s the biggest thing. Lining up back there, you know you’re going to feel the heat. But the idea of being back there and being set is probably an advantage. You can feel the pressure a little better rather than dropping back, setting up, and throwing.”

As most NFL teams looked to install variants of Bill Walsh’s West Coast Offense through the 1980s and 1990s, the shotgun stayed dormant as Walsh and his acolytes operated primarily out of single-back, I, offset I-formations, and the old pro set backfield with the quarterback under center and a halfback and a fullback on either side of him a few yards back. It wasn’t until the new millennium came around that the formation became anything more than a novelty designed for long yardage plays. 

As defenses became more advanced and quarterbacks needed better immediate vision to grasp what they were facing—not to mention the need to get quick passes out to deal with different kinds of rushes and stunts—the shotgun became a valuable offensive adjunct and then the default formation. 

According to Football Outsiders’ charting data, NFL teams ran shotgun just 7.1 percent of their offensive formations in 1989, which is as far back as their data goes. In 2000 it wasn’t much different—just 12.8 percent. The insertion of spread-option quarterbacks and corresponding spread-option schemes made the difference. Use of the shotgun bumped up from 13.3 percent in 2004 to 15.9 percent in 2005 to 19.4 percent in 2006. These were the three years that the Atlanta Falcons led the NFL in rushing with the option-variable backfield of Michael Vick, Warrick Dunn, and T.J. Duckett. 

The 2007 Patriots, who set an NFL record with 589 points scored in the 2007 regular season, were the first modern team to run more than half their plays out of the shotgun formation. They added slot receiver Wes Welker and speed receiver Randy Moss that offseason, expanding their own offense with deep passing concepts. As has been the case through the new millennium, the rest of the league took New England’s lead. The NFL’s shotgun percentage increased every season from 2007 through 2016, and the 2016 49ers coached by former Oregon head coach Chip Kelly (a consultant to Bill Belichick through the years when the Patriots were most interested in spread formations and concepts) ran the shotgun on 99 percent of their snaps. The shotgun started as a gimmick and turned into the way things were.

Brown and Landry helped to define the NFL in a schematic sense in the 1950s. In the 1960s professional football would split itself in two, the NFL would face its most skilled rival, and the resulting merger would make the game more diverse and interesting than it had ever been.
