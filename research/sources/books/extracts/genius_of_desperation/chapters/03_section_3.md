Foreword by Louis Riddick

T
he NFL is a copycat league
. If I have heard that phrase once, I have heard it a thousand times since my days as a professional player came to an end in 1999. But if you take a journey back in time and study the history of this great game on the professional level, it becomes clear that the game would not be what it is today if it merely was about duplicating what was successful for others. What has taken place is a continuous evolution borne out of necessity, a point-counterpoint dynamic between offensive and defensive schemes, strategies, and tactics. 

It all began in earnest in the 1950s when the legendary Paul Brown basically created the blueprint for how the game of football would be played for the next 65-plus years. Football legends—Vince Lombardi, Tom Landry, Sid Gillman, Hank Stram, Al Davis, Bill Walsh, and Bill Belichick—all took from what Coach Brown started, and coaches today continue to look for the next tactical advantage that will give them a leg up on the competition and take the game into the future and beyond.

When Doug Farrar first approached me about writing the foreword for this masterpiece that he has so carefully put together, it quickly became apparent what my contribution should be. I played safety for Belichick when he was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the early 1990s, and, though he was known as a defensive mastermind coming off the success he had with the New York Giants as defensive coordinator in the mid-to-late ’80s, it was not until after my playing career was finished that I truly realized what I had been exposed to. Between Belichick and a man named Nick Saban (you may have heard of him), who was Belichick’s defensive coordinator/defensive backs coach with the Browns, I had received the best training in the history of the game at my position. They were ahead of the game then and they remain ahead of the game now.

The ’90s were a time when offensive football was exploding by way of spread concepts that threatened the field horizontally and vertically, and there were quarterbacks in the league who could light up the scoreboard in a hurry. Dan Marino, Steve Young, Jim Kelly, Warren Moon, and John Elway were all at the top of their game during this time and all destined for the Hall of Fame, and men like Belichick and Saban had to come up with ways to slow them down on a weekly basis. Pre-snap disguise and defensive schematic innovations became points of emphasis for us at the Browns. Things as simple as playing left and right safety instead of strong and free safety in our base and nickel/dime packages so quarter­backs could not get a pre-snap read on our coverage rotations in the secondary were part of the disguise element. The use of pattern matching within zone concepts, which was essentially giving the illusion of playing traditional spot-drop zone coverage at the snap but instead matching up man-to-man as the routes developed down the field, was part of the schematic innovation. With option routes/route conversions becoming more and more standard within NFL offenses being quarterbacked by future Hall of Famers, evolution was necessary or else things were going to get out of control.

The individual player profiles on the defensive side of the ball began to change as well. A greater emphasis was put on speed, lateral agility, and short area quickness when it came to coverage defenders on the second and third level of the defense, as offenses wanted to spread you out and get their best athletes isolated one-on-one in space. If you could not play pass coverage at a high level on third down against legitimate No. 1 wide receivers like Jerry Rice, Andre Rison, Isaac Bruce, and Andre Reed, who were taking the league by storm, then your role began to diminish as a defensive coverage player and players better suited to do so saw their playing time increase. It was what the game demanded, leading to increased specialization. It was what had to be done. Adapt or die.

The Genius of Desperation
 takes you on a comprehensive, chronological journey of how the game of football has become what we know and love it to be today. What it all came down to in the end was finding a way to win games, finding a way to move the ball more effectively on offense and score points, and finding a way to get off the field on third down and keep teams out of the end zone on defense. That’s what the game has always been about, and what it will always be about. It just has been done differently over time, and if you want to know why, this is the book for you.
