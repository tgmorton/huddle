8. Back to School: The NFL in the 2000s

“I don’t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.” 

—Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello in 
The Departed

Aft
er the Run-and-Shoot died out in the NFL in the 1990s, the thought of bringing elements of a spread-out, quick-tempo collegiate passing game to the NFL was put on hold for a number of years. But as the new millennium took shape, the proliferation of spread offenses in the NCAA caused a number of inventive and frustrated NFL coaches, scouts, and executives to take a second look at hybrid possibilities. 

There was Steve Spurrier, who tried iterations of the Fun-and-Gun offense he ran at Florida when he was the head coach of the Washington Redskins from 2002 through 2003. Spurrier went 12–20 in those two seasons, though his failure was less systemic than operational. He famously liked to knock off early for a round of golf while his contemporaries were burning the proverbial midnight oil, and after a few successful outings (Washington beat the Arizona Cardinals 31–23 in Spurrier’s first Redskins game, and Shane Matthews completed 28-of-40 passes for 327 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception), things fell apart. The story goes that the rest of league figured out that Spurrier’s self-lethal combination of simplistic concepts and rudimentary protection schemes—Patrick Ramsey was sacked 30 times in 327 dropbacks in 2003—was better off in college. And that’s where the NFL sent it; Spurrier retreated to South Carolina for the 2005 season. 

In truth Spurrier’s offense was less option-like than people think. He did have tight ends along the formation to block, he did use power running concepts such as the wham and lead draw, and he presented enough NFL route concepts to make the thing work in theory. The problems with Spurrier’s tenure in the nation’s capital centered around other issues. The Redskins were subpar in their personnel at just about every spot in the roster, and Spurrier lacked the vision to do what every successful NFL head coach must do: imprint his philosophy on his team in ways that work over time. Put simply, Spurrier was not an NFL CEO. He was able to appear more successful in the preseason, running up the score because the defenses the Redskins faced weren’t throwing the whole playbook at him. “When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I was going to coach in the NFL five or six years and retire to the beach and play golf a bunch and travel around,” Spurrier 
told the 
Tampa Bay Times
 in 2014. “But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that’s the way I was thinking back then.”

The way Spurrier was thinking did not work. But other teams were about to take college concepts and, with a surer combination of inventiveness and elbow grease, change the way the NFL was played in a major fashion.

The Vick Factor

Michael Vick will forever be known for the federal dogfighting charges that landed him in prison for 21 months and forced him to serve two more months in home confinement from 2007 through 2009. But for our purposes and setting those weighty legal and moral issues aside, Vick can be seen as the first player who proved that—in the right system and with the right player at the helm—a base option offense could succeed wildly in the modern NFL. Selected with the first overall pick in the 2001 draft by the Atlanta Falcons out of Virginia Tech, Vick started just two games in his rookie year but unleashed himself upon the league in his sophomore campaign.

Vick’s first real coronation as a factor in the future of NFL offenses came in the wild-card round of the 2002 season, when the Falcons traveled to Lambeau Field and handed the Green Bay Packers their first home postseason loss in the franchise’s long and vaunted history. Vick’s stats weren’t world-beating—he completed 13-of-25 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown, adding 64 yards on 10 rushing attempts—but the injured Packers couldn’t contain him, and the snowstorm the Packers hoped would slow Vick down never ensued. 

But it was two seasons later at the start of the 2004 campaign when Vick’s palette of tools was completely and fully integrated into an NFL offense. Atlanta led the NFL in rushing yards and yards per rushing attempt every season from 2004 through 2006, and Vick was the pointman in a read-option offense that also featured two running backs—speedy water bug Warrick Dunn and power back T.J. Duckett. In 2006 Vick became the only true quarterback of the modern era to top 1,000 rushing yards in a single season, running for 1,039 yards on just 123 carries for an incredible 8.45 yards per carry average. That season the NFL’s average yards per carry total was 4.2. 

Vick’s most impressive rushing performance of that season came against the New Orleans Saints in Week 12, when he gained 166 yards on the ground, setting his own regulation single-game record and coming ever so close to the NFL mark he had set against the Minnesota Vikings in 2002 with 173 yards, including a 46-yard game-winner in overtime. That said, the Saints game also portended the limitations of a base option offense without a true receiving threat because Atlanta lost that game 31–13. Falcons receivers couldn’t hang on to the ball, and Vick finished his day 9-for-24 for 84 yards. “He’s changed the game,” Vikings linebacker Henri Crockett told ESPN.com after Vick set that rushing record against Minnesota. “There are going to be no more pocket passers anymore.”

The Atlanta Falcons’ read-option offense

That wasn’t quite true, but Vick had set a course in motion that others would follow in different ways. Vick’s incarceration put an end to that iteration of the read-option, but Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Johnson had established a template to counter the Falcons’ multi-faceted run game in the 2004 NFC Championship Game. Instead of having his ends follow the run action and guessing wrong no matter what they did, the blitzingest coach in the NFL went completely against type and directed his defenders to back off and react. 

In theory, opposing defensive coordinators could find themselves in a number of strategic holes. Blitzing would have left gaps open for the one-cut zone-blocking style favored by Falcons offensive assistant Alex Gibbs. Vick’s instructions were simple: check the reads as fast as you possibly can and, if things aren’t to your liking, turn on the jets. His speed made blitzing doubly frustrating. And bringing eight to the box left your defenders caught up in the wave that was Gibbs’ zone concept, and the linebackers were washed out as the cutback went away from them.

Edge rushing from a front three or five and leaving a spy for Vick in the middle didn’t really work either because Gibbs and offensive coordinator Greg Knapp had a kink in the outside zone that further deployed Vick’s speed—a simple option read that kept the end on a string. So the rushing/run-stopping end could either blow right by the running Vick, breaking his own ankles trying to recover, or he could head outside to anticipate the pitch to the back as Vick cut inside and headed upfield. And if the end brought help in the form of a linebacker—in the “scrape exchange,” the end covers the back, and the linebacker deals with the quarterback—that left coverage spots open for Vick to throw to tight end Alge Crumpler, his favorite target at the time. It was simple, brutally effective, and brought the Falcons to Philly. A week after gaining 327 yards on the ground against the St. Louis Rams in the divisional round in the friendly confines of the Georgia Dome, the Falcons would have to deal with zero-degree windchill and gusts of up to 35 miles per hour, putting even more pressure on the running game for a win.

Johnson had a different plan to stop the go-go Falcons, which goes with the theme of this book: great coaches don’t stick with their trademarks on a no-matter-what basis; they constantly go back to the drawing board, finding new ways to set up their personnel for optimal success. Johnson knew where the traps were and, armed with a map of the minefield, effectively won the game in the first three Atlanta drives.

Although other coaches directed their defenders to overpursue Vick at their peril, Johnson used his linebackers to spy zones and gaps instead. He understood that the cold weather and biting wind would take the pass away to a point and thus treated Atlanta’s offense as if it were a 30-year-old Wishbone. Blitz looks were just that—looks for the most part—and those extra defenders would pull back to read and cover at the snap. Ends Jevon Kearse and Derrick Burgess were directed to read and wait instead of pursuing from the start, and Crumpler had to pinball his way through multiple Eagles just to get open. Middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter was the scud missile inside, the one who had to find the open gap and kill it. The supposedly blitz-happy Johnson succeeded by going against schematic type.

On the third play of Atlanta’s first drive, the Falcons went shotgun with two backs, but Johnson countered with an overload left, bringing Dhani Jones and Brian Dawkins up to stop the option to Vick’s right. Checkmate. Vick called timeout. Take Two saw the same Falcons formation and an overload look from the Eagles, but only four rushed at the snap. As Vick tried to gain ground upfield, he was accosted first by Dawkins and then Corey Simon, gaining only two yards. In one simple three-and-out, Johnson showed the Falcons that no matter what variant of their run-based (and admittedly weather-limited) offense they went with he had an answer. Dawkins didn’t really move in coverage on the third-down stop; he simply waited for the play to come to him. Faced with a defense that didn’t bite on the first move he made, Vick lacked productive options.

Despite Vick’s eventual flameout, there were those in the league who believed that a more developed and integrated version of the spread could work in the NFL—or, at least, that the NFL was going to have to take a smarter and more opportunistic look at the players using it in college. Chief among them was Scot McCloughan, who came up as a scout with the Packers in the 1990s and an executive for Mike Holmgren’s Seattle Seahawks from 2000 through 2004. 

In 2005 McCloughan became the vice president of player personnel for the San Francisco 49ers and he selected quarterback Alex Smith of Utah with the first pick overall in the 2005 draft. Smith came from an option system that was simpler than the NFL required, but it was run-based. (Head coach Urban Meyer would take that system to Florida in 2005, engendering a long history of success with Tim Tebow as his most famous running quarterback.) Smith was upended for years by his own limitations and the 49ers’ habit of changing offensive coordinators every year, but, as McCloughan told me in 2007, NFL teams were going to have to change their thinking about players in college offenses for one simple reason—the 
Moneyball
 concept of finding hidden value in underrated assets and bringing the intrinsic value of those assets to the forefront of your business. It was no different in professional football than it was in baseball, or the stock market, or any other professional system in which the meaning of value had changed.

The structure was nascent, but the belief system was coming. The apex of that belief system in the NFL occurred when the NFL’s most successful head coach over the past decade reached out to a college head coach who was about to turn the league on its ear with his own philosophies. Before that could happen, Belichick was upended by an object lesson in option football. Not that Belichick was averse to new offensive trends—the 2007 Patriots were the first team in NFL history to run more than half its plays out of the shotgun formation and set scoring and yardage records that won’t be broken for a good long time—but first a series of gadgets worked ever so well for a short while.

The Wildcat

In August of 2007, Arkansas offensive coordinator David Lee drew up three plays for CBS Sports Network, in which the ball was snapped directly to running backs in his offense. Darren McFadden was the point man on these plays, and as Lee said in the video, there were three base run plays out of what he called the Wildcat package:

Steeler
 
had the running back move from left to right after the snap and take the ball from the quarterback (in this case McFadden). The running back then would blast off to the right behind a pulling left guard, an unbalanced offensive line, and an H-back either between and behind the two right tackles or just outside the right tackle to block.

watch helplessly as the quarterback (McFadden in this case) runs left through a huge open cutback lane. McFadden could cut back and make gains through a number of gaps left by a defense overpursuing to the strong-side. “Darren McFadden is such an extremely unique player in his versatility in the Wildcat, putting him in the shotgun and letting him play quarterback,” Lee said at the time. “He could throw it, run the counter, or the power, or the outside zone. His versatility is something we’ll miss when he’s no longer a Razorback.”

McFadden was selected fourth overall in the 2008 draft by the Oakland Raiders. After the 2007 season, Lee also left Arkansas to become the quarterbacks coach for the Miami Dolphins and he took the Wildcat concepts with him. Something was desperately needed to put the Dolphins, who finished 1–15 in 2007, back on the right track. They began the 2008 season with an 0–2 record, and the inspiration (read: desperation) for change came on the flight back from Phoenix after rookie head coach Tony Sparano had seen his team receive a 31–10 beatdown at the hands of the Arizona Cardinals. Miami had two talented running backs in Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams, but they combined for just 53 yards on 22 carries out of more conventional formations against Arizona’s defense. “We were all miserable at that point,” Sparano told 
USA TODAY
 in December of that year. “I didn’t feel like we had an identity in the run game. I also felt it was getting harder to put Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams in the game at the same time and get them touches.”

Sparano, a former offensive line coach and tight ends coach with several NFL teams and currently the Minnesota Vikings offensive line coach, had done enough vetting with Lee to understand that there was a different option with some potential. “I called David to the front of the plane and said, ‘Here’s what I want: tomorrow when we get back, I want three runs, maybe a pass out of this Wildcat package. We need to find something we can put our arms around as an offense that can create space.”

Sparano, Lee, and offensive coordinator Dan Henning worked on the 
Steeler/Power/Counter
 package through the week with the goal of unleashing it against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. The Patriots had lost Tom Brady for the season to a knee injury in the season’s first game, but they were still a formidable team (they went 11–5 with Matt Cassel at quarterback) with an outstanding defense. Still, the Miami Wildcat cabal saw some vulnerabilities in the Patriots and were able to exploit them in a 38–13 win, in which Brown ran for four touchdowns and threw for another. The Dolphins ran six direct snap plays against the Patriots on that afternoon, and they’re worth reviewing. 

The first 
Power
 play came with 2:32 left in the first quarter and the Dolphins at the New England 2-yard line. Miami lined up in an unbalanced right line with left tackle Jake Long outside right tackle Vernon Carey. Tight end David Martin served as the H-back behind and between Carey and Long. Ricky Williams was in the left slot, and Chad Pennington was split wide to the left. At the snap Williams ran a sweep/reverse look, Brown faked the handoff to him, and left guard Justin Smiley pulled right between Carey and Long. The two tackles had opened up a huge hole, and Smiley busted through to take linebacker Jerod Mayo out of the play to the left. Brown had a truck-sized lane to run through. Later in the game, the Dolphins ran this play again.

Steeler 
play No. 1 came with 4:54 left in the first half; this was the first of three in the second quarter. It had the same formation, same basic personnel. The Patriots appeared to at least recognize the formation this time, but the left side of their secondary—cornerback Deltha O’Neal and safety Rodney Harrison—played back about seven yards. There was little in the way of pre-snap adjustment. As a result the handoff to Williams left the Pats with a blocking mismatch, as Long and Martin sealed off Mike Vrabel, and running back Patrick Cobbs chipped Harrison upfield. The only thing that stopped Williams from a long gain with a quick cut upfield was a stumble and fall. Vrabel was credited with a perfunctory tackle.

Williams recouped those yards on first and 10 with two minutes left in the first half. This was the second 
Steeler
. It had the quick cut inside that Williams missed before. Pennington was lined up wide right this time. Other than that, it was the same personnel grouping. Vince Wilfork came through late on the backside. Martin engaged Vrabel decisively with a great moving block, while Long and Carey slipped to the second level and demolished New England’s linebackers. Williams got past O’Neal and was finally tripped up by Harrison 28 yards downfield at the New England 17. 

The third and final Wildcat play of the second quarter was probably the backbreaker. Miami was at the Patriots’ 5-yard line, and Pennington went wide right again with Cobbs in the right slot. The scoring play was 
Power
, but the Dolphins had a touchdown if they wanted it with Williams running wide in the 
Steeler 
as well. Now, the unmentioned adjustment New England made this time was to spy Ellis Hobbs on Williams as he ran left to right for the fake. But Hobbs focused entirely on Williams and bit too hard. By the time Hobbs realized the ball was coming inside, he couldn’t reverse his direction and get his bearings. All he could do was to grasp at air as Brown went by. Brown’s escorts were dominant once again, as Long, Carey, and Smiley each got a hat on a hat. Brown had little interference on his way to the end zone, and the Patriots had no answer whatsoever for the inside run on the fake. The score at halftime? The very confident Dolphins 21, the extremely confused Patriots 6.

Wildcat No. 5 was the 
Counter
, which featured an aerial option wrinkle. The Dolphins faced third and 3 from the New England 19 with 5:51 left in the third quarter. They employed the same base personnel with Pennington wide right. This time the Pats brought six to the line and essentially eight in the box. At the snap all heads went toward Williams; you could almost
 
feel
 
11 Patriots biting in that direction, and this left all action open for the 
Counter
. Tight end Anthony Fasano ran a seam route from the far left spot in the line right past Mayo and safety Brandon Meriweather. Brown ran the counter option left and threw up a lefty pass to a wide open Fasano for the touchdown. If the previous plays were physically dominant, this one was downright embarrassing. At this point the Dolphins had the vaunted New England defense on a string.

The final Wildcat formation at the beginning of the fourth quarter did in the Patriots. It was first and 10 from the Miami 38 with the same personnel and same basic formation except with Pennington back to wide left. Brown started to look counter after the fake to Williams but saw a 
Power
 lane between Long and Carey (again) while Smiley was at the second level ready to decimate anyone in his way (again). Brown just outran everyone to the end zone, putting the cap on his own great day, an incredible performance by the offensive line, and a real validation for the Miami Dolphins’ coaching staff.

Other teams took notice and adapted the Wildcat to their own devices, as will happen in the NFL; one of the most time-honored truisms is that it’s a copycat league. The Kansas City Chiefs had rookie tailback Jamaal Charles pitch to receiver Mark Bradley and throw a 37-yard touchdown pass to quarterback Tyler Thigpen. The Cardinals, whose head coach Ken Whisenhunt had run option plays with receivers Antwaan Randle El and Hines Ward as the Pittsburgh Steelers’ offensive coordinator a few years before, had receiver Anquan Boldin running the “Pahokee” package named after Boldin’s Florida hometown. The Cleveland Browns ran several iterations of the option with receiver and return specialist Josh Cribbs, who played quarterback at Kent State. Some teams ran the same kinds of blocking concepts that Lee imported from Arkansas, while others thought that a direct snap to a non-quarterback was all they would need to set defenses on edge. 

The latter didn’t generally work too well, and the Wildcat’s success rate was about to plummet. The fundamental issue with the Wildcat against NFL defenses was that it wasn’t variable enough to grow over time. Soon enough, enemy defenses shut it down, 
starting with the Baltimore Ravens
—three games and four weeks after the Wildcat’s triumphant NFL debut. In a 27–13 loss, the Dolphins had to keep their guards in to deal with Baltimore’s physical defensive line, and the linebackers had the range and aggression to deal with the misdirection aspects of the system. Miami was outnumbered by a personnel disadvantage and had no counter as a result. 

Outside of 
Steeler
, 
Power
, 
Counter
, and a few other wrinkles, this ’Cat didn’t have enough different stripes to fool the NFL over time. The 2008 Dolphins ran a total of 965 plays for 5,529 yards, a 5.7 yards-per-play average, and 38 offensive touchdowns. Of those plays 91 were run out of the Wildcat formation—the actual Wildcat, not a read-option or shotgun draw misclassified as such—for 580 yards, a 6.7 yards-per-play average, and eight touchdowns. But after that first blush against the Patriots, it was all diminishing returns. Still, as those two remnants of the game were going through their life cycles, another college coach was working with a concept that would have a lot more staying power in the pros.

The Pistol Offense

“When I presented this to my staff, they looked at me as if I had lost my marbles.” According to the 
2010 Coach of the Year Clinics: Football Manual
,
 
that was the reaction to the birth of the Pistol offense, which was created in 2005 by Nevada head coach Chris Ault, who was trying to strike a balance between the shotgun spread concepts he was increasingly seeing in the NCAA and the vertical running game he deemed crucial to success at any level. Ault was a quarterback at Nevada from 1965 to 1968, and his offensive theories helped make him one of five FBS coaches with more than 200 wins during his tenure.

“I coach the quarterbacks at the University of Nevada and I love to throw the football,” Ault said. “From 1993 through 1996, we led the country, one way or another, in throwing the football.” That said, Ault had to bring it back around. “We have always been a north and south running game offense.” The vehicle Ault would use for this radical transformation came to him in early 2005, and he implemented it that year. “I brought the staff together and I told them that this is what I want to look at during spring practice,” Ault told his fellow coaches. “I want to move the quarterback 4.5 yards off the ball in the shotgun set. We want our deep back to line up seven to 7.5 yards from the center. I wanted to know if we could move the quarterback off the line and still be able run our offense.”

The thought process behind the distance from center of the skill players became clear to Ault as he worked with the formation through those first practices. “I started calling the offense the Pistol—the quarterback was the trigger, and the deep back was the hammer of the pistol,” he said. “We took the kids out on the field and ran all the tests on the depth of the back. We lined the tailback up three yards behind the quarterback [who was then 7.5 yards behind center]. It was difficult to see the running back directly behind the quarterback three yards away. At five yards away, the linebackers could see the running back better. By having him seven yards deep, we can get the ball to him deeper than we would if the quarterback was under center.”

Ault’s new offense really hit the big time when a lightly recruited quarterback named Colin Kaepernick took it over in 2007 as a true freshman and eventually became the first quarter­back in NCAA history to throw for more than 10,000 yards and rush for more than 4,000 yards in his collegiate career. Still, Kaepernick had to answer the same old questions about his ability to operate in a traditional, dropback offense behind center. “I don’t think our offense will directly translate, but I think we do a bunch of things as progressions and protections that are similar to what NFL teams do, and we just call them something different,” he said at the 2011 Scouting Combine. “Picking up on terminology will be a big thing for me, learning what those mean as opposed to what we call things.”

But there had been a minor Pistol revolution going on the NFL a few years before Kaepernick made himself available for the NFL, and the terminology was about to come far more his way than the other way around. In 2008 the Kansas City Chiefs were struggling mightily on offense. Their top two quarterbacks, Damon Huard and Brodie Croyle, were out with injuries, and their star running back, Larry Johnson, had been deactivated by the team (and later the NFL) for a number of violations of team and league code. Offensive coordinator Chan Gailey had a hard row to hoe, but he had seen what Ault had been doing in Nevada and he imagined that he could find success with third-string quarterback Tyler Thigpen—an athletic, second-year castoff from the Minnesota Vikings—who had played an iteration of the spread at Coastal Carolina. “It was kind of an adjustment on the fly,” Thigpen said in 2010. “The main reason we went to the Pistol offense in Kansas City was 
Larry Johnson
. He was more of a downhill back, not an offset guy in a shotgun, doing zone runs. So, that was the main reason we were doing that kind of stuff. It allowed us to open up a lot of things because you could go with regular personnel and still fool the defense. It was hard for the defense to see the ball, whether you were handing off or faking it and it really allowed us to do a lot of different things.”

The Kansas City Chiefs’ Pistol offense

Gailey implemented the shotgun as a primary concern during Kansas City’s Week 7 game against the Tennessee Titans. After the Chiefs had lost 34–0 to the Carolina Panthers the week before, there was little left to lose. Johnson returned to action in Week 11 against the Titans, and that’s when Gailey really unleashed the Pistol’s potentially lethal combination of formation versatility and traditional power in the running game. “Once that suspension was up, and Larry was back in the lineup, that’s when we went more to the Pistol offense,” Thigpen said. “[Running backs] Kolby [Smith] and Jamaal [Charles] were used to that zone type of running, where you press the side and make a cutback—or whatever the case may be—whatever lane they’ve got. We tried running that offense for one or two weeks when Larry came back and then we realized, ‘Hey, he’s not that kind of back.’ That’s when we changed to the downhill kind of running. The Pistol is really like an I formation, whether you put the back in the near set or the far set.”

 Johnson’s 15-yard run with 2:25 left in the Week 13 win against the Oakland Raiders
 
was a good example of how the Pistol cut defensive read time, especially when any sort of delay was involved. On this play Thigpen took just an extra moment before handing the ball to Johnson, which had linebacker Thomas Howard overpursuing inside as Johnson bounced outside right. Thigpen told me that there were all kinds of effective schematic combinations. 
“Whether it was a quarterback draw, a misdirection with a one-back offset, having the back go to the left and bringing him back to the right, it would look to the defense like a zone left run instead of a cutback to the right,” he said. “The play-action was really good because you couldn’t see the back and whether he had the ball or not with the offensive line up front. I remember a couple times, just running boots and faking to [the back], and it was just wide open when I came out on the boot. It was tough for the defensive end, when he’s coming off the edge, to see whether you gave it or not. Normally, he has that advantage when you’re coming out from under center to see
—
whether you’re close to the back or not
—
what kind of fake it is.”

And that’s what made the Pistol more versatile, universal, and transferrable than the Wildcat had been. The Wildcat was a series of three base plays with room for a few new wrinkles, while the Pistol was a larger mold coaches could use to pour their own specific knowledge into. 

The San Francisco 49ers selected Kaepernick in the second round of the 2011 draft, but it wasn’t until his second season that he got more than a few looks in what offensive coordinator Greg Roman later called “the Colin Package.” Long before this, though, Roman, who worked with head coach Jim Harbaugh at Stanford and then at San Francisco, had traveled to see Ault and explore the possibilities inherent in the Pistol concept. “About three years ago, (I) made the trek to Nevada and visited with him and his staff,” Roman told NBC Sports Bay Area in December of 2012. “That was very valuable time spent. He was very accommodating, and it was very interesting as a coach to go really learn something totally new. And he’s a very good football coach.”

Roman was then looking to implement Pistol play designs at Stanford, where he and Harbaugh had the kind of power/counter run game and variable passing game that would seem to be a perfect fit. When Kaepernick became the starter in Week 7 of the 2012 season after Alex Smith suffered a concussion, Roman had worked enough with Kaepernick to make it fly. What Roman called the Q formation (so named because the 49ers preferred to keep their play calls to one syllable) became the 49ers’ base quarter­back formation, and the 49ers did all kinds of different things with it. They put multiple backs around Kaepernick—one behind him in the traditional Pistol spacing and one to each side—in a full-house power package. They used offset Pistol with a back to Kaepernick’s left or right side (the offense’s strong or weak-side) and they ran a lot of highly effective play-action out of the Pistol. In 2013 Kaepernick’s first season as an NFL starter, he completed 61.3 percent of his passes out of play-action with 11 touchdowns and one interception—as opposed to a 57.2 completion rate, 10 touchdowns, and seven interceptions without play-action. 

But what made the Pistol work for the 49ers—and provided a guide to future use—was how well they integrated it with traditional football concepts. Every aspect of the Kaepernick option game had its antecedents—from the old-school Wishbone, to the trap blocks favored by the Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s, to the counter plays defined by the Washington Redskins of the John Riggins era, to the read-option, to the Pistol. But the ways in which the 49ers put it together were very different and quite befuddling even to NFL defenses that were primed to stop just about anything.

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s 56-yard touchdown in the 2012 NFC Divisional Playoff Game

The most compelling example of the 49ers’ Pistol offense came in the divisional round of the 2012 playoffs, when Kaepernick broke Michael Vick’s single-game rushing record for a quarterback with 181 yards as San Francisco beat the Green Bay Packers 45–31. Harbaugh and Roman understood and exploited a kink in Dom Capers’ defense. Because the Packers’ cornerbacks played a high percentage of press-man coverage, lining up as close to the receivers as possible and turning their backs to run with those receivers, Kaepernick had more room and a higher percentage of outside rushing lanes. 

Kaepernick’s 56-yard touchdown run in the third quarter of that game was an object lesson in how the Pistol—and the run-based deception it produces—can leave aggressive defenses in a major hole. On this play the 49ers lined up with two tight ends to the left, and outside tight end/fullback Bruce Miller motioned into the backfield. This offset Pistol formation set the edge for Kaepernick’s run because Miller moved across the formation at the snap and blocked left outside linebacker Erik Walden (93) to help give Kaepernick a lane in the middle of the formation. The Packers had three defensive linemen stacked in the middle of the line, but San Francisco’s power blockers took them out, and the inside linebackers bit on the play-action fake to halfback LaMichael James. San Francisco had two receivers to the right—Michael Crabtree to the inside and Ted Ginn, Jr. to the outside—and they blocked out Green Bay’s attempt to counter Kaepernick with a two-deep safety look converted by motion to a single-high concept. “We didn’t make any adjustments,” Packers defensive back Charles Woodson told NFL.com after that loss. “I just think when the game is going the way it is, you’ve got to try something different. It’s hard to just continue to do the same thing over and over again and continue to get burned…We need to figure out: could we have done something differently as far as our gameplan was concerned?”

Whatever that something different may have been, it didn’t show up in the 2013 season opener. This time Green Bay had its forces arrayed against San Francisco’s running game, and Kaepernick responded by completing 27-of-39 passes for 412 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 34–28 victory. Using the old adage that if you want a running quarterback to stop running, you hit him hard enough to make him do something else, the Packers tried to intimidate Kaepernick. Much to Green Bay’s dismay, receiver Anquan Boldin, who the 49ers acquired in a trade from the Baltimore Ravens after Baltimore had beaten them in the previous Super Bowl, outmuscled the Packers’ defense for 13 catches, 208 yards, and a touchdown. Tight end Vernon Davis added six catches for 98 yards and two touchdowns of his own. The Kaepernick 49ers eventually came into disrepair due to personnel mismanagement and power struggles up top. But for a brief moment in time, Kaepernick looked to be the next evolution in quarterbacking. 

Belichick and Kelly: The Student Becomes the Teacher 

The NFL embraced the speed no-huddle offense as never before in 2012, when the New England Patriots ratcheted the tempo of their game to previously unforeseen levels. Bill Belichick’s team changed its play-calling and schematics to force defenses to bend to their will, something that Bill Walsh had predicted years before. In his seminal 1998 book, 
Finding the Winning Edge
, Walsh said that:

Teams will only huddle when the clock is stopped.

Teams will use single-word offensive audibles. 

The timing between the quarterback and the receiver will be more defined.

The quarterback will receive direction from the coach at the line of scrimmage. Because the ball can be put into play at any moment, the defense must commit itself with its front and coverage.

Belichick had already adopted certain aspects of a wide-open offense that his forbearers refused to take on. The 2007 Patriots were the first NFL team of the modern era to run more than 50 percent of their plays in the shotgun. They set a league record with 589 regular-season points, breaking the record set by the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, who had Randall Cunningham—a “converted” running quarterback—under center. In 2008 three teams—the Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs, and Arizona Cardinals—went shotgun more than half the time. By 2014 that figure had grown to 26 of the 32 NFL teams, and the Philadelphia Eagles led the league with an NFL record 86 percent of their plays with their quarterback away from center. The 2014 Eagles were coached by former Oregon head man Chip Kelly—it was his second year in the NFL—but Kelly had already had a fairly major effect on the pros, and Belichick was the conduit. 

Belichick reached out to Kelly, and the then-Oregon head coach visited the Patriots’ facility in 2010 to discuss an offense that had taken the Pac-12 by storm with its speed concepts, run/pass equality, and ability to force opposing defenses to stay in their base formations. “I was interested to hear how he did it,” Belichick told 
The Boston Globe
 in 2012. “I would say he expanded it to a different level, and it was very interesting to understand what he was doing. Certainly, I’ve learned a lot from talking to Chip about his experiences with it and how he does it and his procedure and all that.”

The Patriots started to adapt their playbook to a new level of simplicity in 2011 under then-offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien. A play that may have been called 
0 Flood FAP—SP 238 MAX Z Cross X V
 in 2004 was now called much more quickly. Quarterback Tom Brady might utter one word after a play was over to signify the details of a new play, and his teammates would understand what to do and where to go with opposing defenses unable to adjust. 

In 2012 Belichick’s team set another record. This time it was the number of offensive plays in the regular season (1,191). They also led the league in points with 557, but they did it in a different fashion—by dialing their percentage of shotgun down to 48.2 percent, 14
th
 in the league. Other teams used no-huddle more often than New England did, but no team used the hurry-up with greater effectiveness because the Patriots still put a full array of plays and personnel on the field. It was spread speed with traditional depth, and defenses simply didn’t know what to do. No surprise that Kelly’s Eagles ramped up their own tempo, registering 1,054 plays in 2013 (Kelly’s first season) and 1,127 in 2014.

How did defenses adjust? By running far more nickel and dime defenses (five and six defensive backs on the field) and drafting lighter, quicker linebackers who were more half-field defenders than old-school thumpers. From 2011 through 2014, the number of base NFL defensive plays with five or more defensive backs increased from 40 percent in 2011, to 44 percent in 2012, to 49 percent in 2013, to 60 percent in 2014. The effective elimination of substitution advantage forced desperate teams to re-jigger their personnel strategies, and eventually more traditionally-minded coaches would follow suit. “There’s been so much passing game in the last 10 years, and I think the nickel—it’s half the game,” Pete Carroll said in 2014. “Half the game, you’re in nickel or some kind of substitution defense. So, it’s whichever way you want to look at it; maybe that’s base, and the other part is substitution now. We’re divided about 500 plays year in and year out, and it’s a big deal. That’s why [on defense], we have more than 11 starters. We’ve got 15 to 16 starters that we see, and you can tell, depending on the opponent and the situation in the game, how many of those guys we’ll move in and out and feel comfortable doing that.”

Carroll was USC’s head coach from 2001 through 2009, a position he took after a long history as a successful defensive coordinator and a less notable head coach with the New York Jets and Patriots. Carroll was a prolific winner with the Trojans and he ran a series of run-heavy, traditional offenses with quarterbacks from Carson Palmer to Mark Sanchez. When he returned to the NFL in 2010 as the head coach of the Seahawks, it appeared to be business as usual. In that first season, Carroll’s Seahawks ran the ball frequently and used the shotgun in just 38.2 percent of their plays. But by 2014 that shotgun percentage had increased to 69 percent, and Seattle ranked just 10
th
 in that statistic. 

The difference was quarterback Russell Wilson, a highly mobile and productive player who ran a West Coast Offense at North Carolina State and a two-back power zone system for a season at Wisconsin. In that regard Wilson was the perfect field general in an offense that ran two-back power zone with West Coast passing principles, but the force multiplier came when Carroll and offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell turned Wilson loose as an option factor. All of a sudden, defenses didn’t know how to deal with the duality of Wilson crashing the edge as a runner and Marshawn Lynch bowling through defensive fronts as the best pure runner in the league. 

Carroll adapted his offense even more than his defense, and he did so predominantly because of one quarterback—Robert Griffin III of the Washington Redskins, the second overall pick in the 2012 draft. Wilson was taken 73 picks later. In his rookie season, Griffin took elements of the offense he ran under Art Briles at Baylor (shotgun, spread concepts, hurried tempo) and married it to those presented by Washington head coach Mike Shanahan and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan (Mike’s son). The Shanahans added the Pistol to the zone-running scheme the elder Shanahan had espoused for decades—the same one Alex Gibbs employed that benefitted Michael Vick with the Atlanta Falcons years before—and turned Griffin into a rookie revolution. 

It was Griffin, not Wilson or No. 1 overall pick Andrew Luck, who won the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award, completing more than 65 percent of his passes for 3,200 yards, 20 touchdowns, and five interceptions. Griffin added 815 yards and seven touchdowns as a rusher, and the combination of Shanahan’s zone blocking and the stress presented to any defense by Griffin’s pure speed turned sixth-round rookie Alfred Morris into a 1,600-yard back in his debut season. “I was impressed with how much they got out of it,” Carroll said in November of 2012. “They’re way ahead of everybody else in terms of their commitment to a college style of offense, and it’s been very effective…It was a good move for me and it’s helped us a little bit. I was influenced a little bit more than I thought when I first looked at. You see some of our stuff coming to life, and it’s helping us.”

It helped out with Wilson in part because he was perfectly attuned to the West Coast Offense passing game with a two-back power ground attack that Bevell wanted to run. As Wilson told me in his rookie year, the formations and terminology were so similar to his college offenses that the learning curve was not nearly as steep as he might have imagined. 

The NFL undervalued Wilson because he stood 5

, but he beat out high-priced free-agent quarterback Matt Flynn in his first training camp and was named the Seahawks’ starter before he was out of his first preseason. And in some ways, Wilson has been the ideal mixture of dynamism and efficiency many were eventually hoping to see from a mobile quarterback. His 161/56 touchdown/interception ratio through the 2017 regular season gets a bit lost in the fact that the Seahawks buttressed him with a great running game and the league’s best defense, but as much as Lynch opened things up for Wilson by forcing defenses to cheat up to stop him, Wilson opened things up for Lynch and the rest of the Seattle offense with his own rushing ability. It’s been said that Wilson had to go to the NFL to play in a college offense, and that’s generally true of the transition that the Seahawks—and many other teams—have undergone. Even the staunchest traditionalists have turned around.

Mike Holmgren, who coached the Green Bay Packers and Seahawks to a 161–111 record over 17 seasons, was a Bill Walsh acolyte. And Walsh believed that although several things could happen in a shotgun-heavy offense, most of them were bad. There’s little doubt that if Walsh was alive and coaching today, he’d find a way to not only change his thinking in that regard, but also put himself—and his quarterbacks—at the head of the pack. That’s what the great innovators do, especially when they’re playing from behind. 

With all that said, the question 
still 
remains—is there a repeatable way to make a quarterback dependent on a “college system” successful at an elite level in the pros? Vick had a brief redemptive curve with the Eagles. Colin Kaepernick regressed when defenses assessed that the best thing to do was to wait him out and force him to rely on a limited palette of field-reading abilities. Griffin succumbed to injuries and a new head coach in Jay Gruden, who seemed uniquely put off by his skillset. Cam Newton, who was productive early on with the Carolina Panthers when his coaching staff merged the system he ran at Auburn with the one he would use at the next level, is still a work in progress. “There is a transition,” Holmgren said of Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota on Seattle radio station KJR in April of 2015. Mariota, a graduate of Kelly’s Oregon system, who became the Tennessee Titans’ starting quarterback. “There is a learning curve there. And I go back to Alex Smith when he was at Utah with Urban Meyer, and Scotty McCloughan, who worked for me in Seattle, was now the San Francisco general manager. He phoned me up and said, ‘We’re going to take Alex Smith. What do you think?’ And I said, ‘Well, he was the youngest guy in the draft that year—like 20 years old.’ So, he was young and he came from a systems offense, which was even more unique then than it is now. So, there is going to be a longer learning curve to play the position—what they ask him to do in the NFL. Having said that, he’s a phenomenal athlete and a great kid. If everyone’s on board in knowing that it’s going to take a little time, it’ll work.”

It didn’t work for Smith for years because the fix the 49ers were in through his early days; he was more successful when he was Kaepernick’s predecessor under Jim Harbaugh and then under Andy Reid in Kansas City. Aaron Rodgers was taken 24
th
 overall in that same draft by the Green Bay Packers and completed just 35 passes in his first three NFL seasons as he sat behind Brett Favre. In the end the time served was good for Rodgers. He used it to develop an understanding of what the NFL required. 

Even those coaches and general managers who are convinced that the new wave of quarterback mobility and offensive multiplicity is the way to go will tell you that there’s more expected of NFL quarterbacks if they ever want to ascend to the highest level the position allows. John Schneider, Seattle’s general manager and the man who banged on the table for Wilson, remarked at the 2015 Scouting Combine that the transitional evaluation of these types of quarterbacks isn’t getting any easier. “It’s so unique seeing those guys go into the Senior Bowl and seeing those guys under center,” Schneider said. “You’ve got guys moving around, how they move in the pocket, how they adjust. It’s harder now. When you watch college football, you see those guys looking to the sideline, and I know me, personally, I’ve made several mistakes in that regard. You may question the guy’s decision-making. You may value it higher—his intellectual level or what a good football guy he is—but you don’t truly know because [he is] looking at the sidelines at cards. It’s just a process that we have to continue to work through and evaluate. Like any other position, we evaluate all the way through the spring. It’s really about figuring out how the guy processes. Can he get the information? Can he express it to his teammates? Can he read a defense? What those guys do…I mean, that’s pretty intense stuff. It’s like learning a whole language.”
