Acknowledgments

This book would not exist without Mike Tanier, who kicked my ass when I didn’t believe I was
 the one to do it, and Laura Fritts-Drew, who offered her love, her support, and her awesome Whidbey Island cabin as the perfect writer’s retreat when deadlines were looming. My gratitude knows no bounds.

Louis Riddick, for your time and great words.

Michelle Bruton, Jeff Fedotin, Josh Williams, and everyone at Triumph Books for the opportunity to make this project a public endeavor.

Aaron Schatz, Matt Ryan, Tom Mantzouranis, Chris Stone, Ben Eagle, Melissa Jacobs, Ian Kenyon, and Collin McCollough for editorial wisdom through time.

Everyone who’s been a part of the NFL1000. When you’re an old guy with half a clue, it’s crucial to learn from young and hungry talents who can show you different ways to think.

Peter King, Greg Cosell, Jim Trotter, Mark Pesavento, Matt Ryan, and Mike Freeman for your mentorship and generosity of spirit.

The book’s “beta readers”—Brian Billick, Chris Brown, Greg Cosell, Mike Freeman, Tony Khan, Amy Trask, Jim Trotter, Trey Wingo, Dave Zirin. Your insight is greatly appreciated. 

Local inspiration: everyone who is grinding away at Hedge­brook and Hugo House and all the writers’ groups and colonies in and around Seattle. I’m blessed to live in a literary city with infinite creative energy. Liz Matthews, Ian Furness, John Clayton, Stephen Cohen, and everyone in the Seattle football media.
