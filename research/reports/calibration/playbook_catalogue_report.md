## The Route Tree (0-9)

The standard NFL route tree assigns numbers to routes based on depth and direction:

| # | Route | Depth | Direction | Description |
|---|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | Hitch | 5 yds | Stop | Run 5, stop and turn back |
| 1 | Flat | 2 yds | Outside | Release to flat area |
| 2 | Slant | 5 yds | Inside | 3-step, break inside at 45° |
| 3 | Comeback | 15 yds | Outside | Push vertical, come back to sideline |
| 4 | Curl | 12 yds | Inside | Push vertical, curl back toward QB |
| 5 | Out | 12 yds | Outside | Push vertical, break hard to sideline |
| 6 | Dig/In | 12 yds | Inside | Push vertical, break inside across field |
| 7 | Corner | 15 yds | Outside | Push vertical, break to pylon at 45° |
| 8 | Post | 15 yds | Inside | Push vertical, break to goalpost at 45° |
| 9 | Go/Fade | 30 yds | Vertical | Straight vertical, beat defender deep |

**Pattern:** Even numbers break inside, odd numbers break outside.

## Implementation Notes

### For Simulation
Each concept should include:
1. **Route waypoints** for all receivers
2. **Read progression** (which receiver to look at first)
3. **Coverage key** (what defender determines the read)
4. **Timing** (when routes break, when ball should come out)

### For Play Calling AI
1. **Situation awareness** - Down, distance, score
2. **Coverage recognition** - Pre-snap read, coverage beater
3. **Tendencies** - Don't be predictable
4. **Personnel matchups** - Exploit advantages

### Missing from Current Implementation
- Double moves (sluggo, post-corner, out-and-up)
- Option routes (adjust based on coverage)
- Screen blocking assignments
- RPO mesh points and read keys
- Play action fake timing

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with existing routes.py** - Add missing route waypoints
2. **Integrate with concepts.py** - Add new pass concepts
3. **Integrate with run_concepts.py** - Add missing run plays
4. **Build play calling AI** - Use coverage beaters for smart calls
5. **Add double moves** - Require timing and setup
6. **Add RPO mechanics** - Read keys and mesh points
