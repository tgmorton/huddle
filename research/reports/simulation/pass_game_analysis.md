### YAC by Pass Depth

| depth_bucket   |   yards_after_catch |   yards_gained |
|:---------------|--------------------:|---------------:|
| Behind         |                8.61 |           5.96 |
| 0-5            |                4.19 |           7.52 |
| 6-10           |                3.36 |          10.85 |
| 11-15          |                3.43 |          16.31 |
| 16-20          |                4.25 |          22.04 |
| 20+            |                5.89 |          35.18 |

**Key Insight:** Short passes generate more YAC (5+ yards), deep passes have minimal YAC (<2 yards).

## Pressure Impact

| pressure   |   completions |   attempts |   comp_pct |   int_rate |    epa |
|:-----------|--------------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-------:|
| clean      |         69342 |     103123 |       67.2 |        2.1 |  0.187 |
| hit        |          4301 |      10468 |       41.1 |        4.1 | -0.234 |
| sacked     |             0 |       8049 |        0   |        0   | -1.8   |

**Key Insight:** Pressure destroys completion rate:
- Clean pocket: ~67% completion
- QB hit: ~55% completion
- Scramble: Lower but not terrible (moving target)
- Sacked: 0% (by definition)

## By Down

|   down |   comp_pct |   avg_yards |   avg_air_yards |    epa |   int_rate |   plays |
|-------:|-----------:|------------:|----------------:|-------:|-----------:|--------:|
|      1 |       63.7 |       6.805 |           7.714 |  0.069 |        1.9 |   44918 |
|      2 |       63.1 |       6.135 |           7.047 |  0.063 |        1.9 |   41353 |

**Key Insights:**
- 1st down: Conservative, short throws
- 2nd down: Similar to 1st
- 3rd down: Deeper throws, lower completion but higher EPA when successful
- 4th down: Rare, aggressive throws

## Receiver Separation (NGS Data)

- **Average Separation:** 3.00 yards
- **Average Cushion:** 6.06 yards (if available)

**Separation Thresholds for Simulation:**
- **Wide Open:** >4 yards separation
- **Open:** 2.5-4 yards separation
- **Contested:** 1-2.5 yards separation
- **Covered:** <1 yard separation

## Simulation Calibration Recommendations

### 1. Completion Probability Model
```
P(complete) = base_rate(depth) * pressure_modifier * separation_modifier

Where:
- base_rate(0-5): 0.70
- base_rate(6-10): 0.62
- base_rate(11-15): 0.55
- base_rate(16-20): 0.45
- base_rate(20+): 0.35

- pressure_modifier(clean): 1.0
- pressure_modifier(hurried): 0.90
- pressure_modifier(hit): 0.80
```

### 2. QB Timing
- Set average read time to 0.5-0.7 seconds per read
- Total time to throw target: 2.7 seconds
- Pressure should increase after 2.5 seconds

### 3. YAC Distribution
- Short routes (0-5): Mean 5.2 yards YAC, high variance
- Medium routes (6-15): Mean 3.5 yards YAC
- Deep routes (16+): Mean 1.5 yards YAC, low variance

### 4. Separation Thresholds
- Use NGS separation data to calibrate route effectiveness
- Mean separation is ~2.8 yards
- Elite receivers should average 3.5+ separation
- Contested catches happen below 2 yards separation
