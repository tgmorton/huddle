## Executive Summary

The real NFL run game has these characteristics that our simulation should match:

- **Average:** 4.5 yards per carry
- **Median:** 3.0 yards (tells us distribution is right-skewed)
- **Stuffed (loss):** 8.7% of runs
- **Short gains (1-3):** 36.4% of runs
- **Medium gains (4-6):** 24.1% of runs
- **Explosive (10+):** 11.6% of runs

## Yards Distribution

| Percentile | Yards |
|------------|-------|
| 10th | 0 |
| 25th | 1 |
| 50th (Median) | 3 |
| 75th | 6 |
| 90th | 11 |
| 95th | 14 |
| 99th | 28 |

**Key Insight:** 50% of runs gain 3 yards or less. 75% gain 5 yards or less.
The 4-6 yard "good run" is actually in the 50th-75th percentile.

## By Down

|   down |   plays |   mean_yards |   median_yards |   std_yards |   first_down_rate |   mean_epa |

**Key Insights:**
- 1st down runs average the most yards
- 3rd and 4th down runs have lower averages (defense knows it's coming)
- First down conversion rate drops significantly on 3rd/4th down

## By Yards to Go

| ytg_bucket   |   plays |   mean_yards |   median_yards |   first_down_rate |   mean_epa |

**Key Insight:** Short yardage (1-2) has highest EPA - this is where runs are most valuable.

## Simulation Calibration Recommendations

### 1. Yards Distribution Target
Our simulation should produce:
- ~20% of runs for loss or no gain
- ~35% of runs for 1-3 yards
- ~25% of runs for 4-6 yards
- ~10% of runs for 7-9 yards
- ~10% of runs for 10+ yards

### 2. Average YPC Target
- Target: 4.2-4.5 yards per carry average
- Median should be 3 yards (not the mean!)

### 3. Explosive Play Rate
- 10+ yard runs: ~10% of all runs
- 20+ yard runs: ~2-3% of all runs

### 4. Situation Awareness
- Short yardage should convert ~75%+ of the time
- 3rd/4th down runs should have lower success rate
- Runs when ahead by 14+ should average less (stacked boxes)
