|----------|----------|-------------|
| forty | bench | 0.50 |
| forty | vertical | -0.73 |
| forty | broad_jump | -0.82 |
| forty | cone | 0.81 |
| forty | shuttle | 0.78 |
| forty | wt | 0.86 |
| bench | broad_jump | -0.37 |
| bench | cone | 0.46 |
| bench | shuttle | 0.41 |
| bench | wt | 0.67 |
| vertical | broad_jump | 0.83 |
| vertical | cone | -0.67 |
| vertical | shuttle | -0.69 |
| vertical | wt | -0.61 |
| broad_jump | cone | -0.72 |
| broad_jump | shuttle | -0.70 |
| broad_jump | wt | -0.69 |
| cone | shuttle | 0.87 |
| cone | wt | 0.78 |
| shuttle | wt | 0.75 |

**Key Insights:**
- Weight negatively correlates with speed metrics (heavier = slower)
- Vertical and broad jump are positively correlated (explosive athletes)
- 3-cone and shuttle are highly correlated (agility cluster)

## Player Generation Recommendations

### 1. Use Real Distributions
Replace hardcoded mean/std with actual combine data:
```python
# Example: WR profile
WR_PROFILE = {
    'height': Normal(73.5, 2.1),  # inches
    'weight': Normal(199, 14),     # lbs
    'forty': Normal(4.48, 0.11),   # seconds
    'vertical': Normal(36.5, 3.2), # inches
}
```

### 2. Add Correlations
Fast players (low 40) tend to have:
- Lower weight
- Higher vertical
- Lower bench press reps

### 3. Position-Specific Ranges
Don't let an OL run a 4.3 forty or a CB weigh 300 lbs.
Use the 10th/90th percentiles as hard bounds.

### 4. "Athletic Freak" Detection
Players >90th percentile in 2+ metrics are rare but exist.
About 5% of players should be "freaks" in 1-2 areas.

## Attribute Mapping Suggestions

| Combine Metric | Simulation Attribute | Mapping |
|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| 40-yard dash | Speed | inv_normalize(4.2, 5.5) |
| 40-yard dash | Acceleration | inv_normalize(4.2, 5.5) |
| Bench press | Strength | normalize(0, 35) |
| Vertical jump | Jumping | normalize(25, 45) |
| Broad jump | Explosion | normalize(90, 140) |
| 3-cone | Agility | inv_normalize(6.5, 8.0) |
| Shuttle | Change of Direction | inv_normalize(3.8, 4.8) |
