Signing off for today. The key defender read implementation spec you requested is on my list for next session.

Quick answers to your questions while they are fresh:

1. **Pressure interaction** - Yes, under critical pressure skip the read and go to hot route or checkdown. The key defender read is for clean/moderate pocket situations.

2. **Disguised coverage** - If key defender cannot be identified post-snap, fall back to progression order. The read is an optimization, not a requirement.

3. **Quick game vs dropback** - Quick game (hitch, slant) should use simpler logic (is my guy open Y/N). Key defender reads are for dropback concepts with multiple options developing.

Will write the full spec next time.
