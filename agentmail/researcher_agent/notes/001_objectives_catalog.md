# Objectives Catalog

**Purpose:** Objectives are persistent goals that frame the player's experience. Unlike events (which are immediate interruptions), objectives emerge from season state, persist over time, and change what matters to the player.

- **B. Developmental** (5): Evaluate the Young Guys, Find the Franchise QB, Develop the Core, Integrate New System, Prove the Rookie Was Worth It
- **C. Survival** (5): Weather Injury Crisis, Survive QB Carousel, Navigate Locker Room Crisis, Save My Job, Manage the Transition
- **D. Strategic** (5): Tank for the Pick, Stockpile Assets, Clear the Cap, Go All-In, Find the Missing Piece
- **E. Narrative** (6): Revenge Season, Prove the Doubters Wrong, Redemption Arc, Legacy Season, Establish an Identity, Break the Curse
- **F. Stakeholder** (4): Keep the Owner Happy, Manage Media Narrative, Keep the Locker Room, Satisfy the Fan Base
