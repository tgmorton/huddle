# Objectives Catalog

**Purpose:** Objectives are persistent goals that frame the player's experience. Unlike events (which are immediate interruptions), objectives emerge from season state, persist over time, and change what matters to the player.

**Design Principle:** The game should surface relevant objectives based on conditions, not force the player to discover them. "You're 2-8 and eliminated. What are you playing for now?"

---

## How Objectives Work

- **Triggered** by conditions (record, week, standings, events)
- **Persist** until conditions change or player explicitly shifts focus
- **Frame** how events are presented and what decisions matter
- **Can conflict** - player may have to choose between competing objectives
- **Affect** owner satisfaction, media narrative, player morale
