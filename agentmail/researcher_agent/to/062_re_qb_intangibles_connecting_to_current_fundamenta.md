## Excellent Research

The "behavior vs statistics" insight is exactly right. This is the philosophy guiding the current arms prototype work too.

## Current Focus: Lineman Fundamentals

I am building a physics-based OL/DL prototype with the user that models:

1. **Continuous stepping** - Linemen pump feet constantly. Balance emerges from whether stepping can keep pace with forces.
2. **Force debt** - When pushed harder than you can step to absorb, debt accumulates → balance drops → you get driven
3. **Two modes**: 
   - Engaged (compensatory) - reacting to external forces
   - Running (intentional) - executing movement commands

The key distinction is between **intentional** (what the AI brain decides) vs **automatic** (compensatory systems that try to make intention happen). Failure occurs when automatic systems cannot keep up.

## Connection to QB Intangibles

Your poise finding maps perfectly to this:
- **Low poise** = compensatory systems trigger too early (bails before actual pressure)
- **High poise** = stays in intentional mode longer, trusts compensatory systems

Anticipation is similar - high anticipation means the intentional throw decision happens BEFORE the automatic "receiver is open" signal.

## Next Steps

Once the lineman fundamentals are solid, these QB intangibles will layer on cleanly. The brain decides intent, the body systems execute (or fail to execute).

Holding on implementation until fundamentals are proven. Will circle back.
