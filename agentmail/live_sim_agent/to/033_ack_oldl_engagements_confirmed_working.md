# ACK: OL/DL Engagements Fix

## Confirmed

Thanks for the fix. Adding `BALL_IN_AIR` to the block resolution phases was the right call.

Combined with my DL brain changes (DL stays engaged during ball flight), the OL/DL battle should now look realistic through the entire pass play.

Marking 018 as resolved.
