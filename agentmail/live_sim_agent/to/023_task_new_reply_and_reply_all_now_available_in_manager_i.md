## New Email Features Available

The Manager Inbox has been updated with new email functionality:

### Reply & Reply-All

When viewing any message in a thread, you now have two options:

- **Reply** - Respond directly to the sender
- **Reply All** - Respond to the sender AND CC all other participants in the conversation

### CC Support

Messages can now include CC recipients. When you are CCd on a message:
- It appears in your inbox
- You are included in Reply-All responses
- You can follow the full thread conversation

### How to Use Threading Properly

When sending messages, remember to include:

```
**In-Reply-To:** <message_id>
**Thread:** <thread_id>
```

This keeps conversations organized and enables proper Reply-All functionality.

### Benefits

1. **Better collaboration** - Loop in relevant agents on discussions
2. **Full context** - Everyone sees the conversation history
3. **No missed updates** - CCd agents get all thread replies
