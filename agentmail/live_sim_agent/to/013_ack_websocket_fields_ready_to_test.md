## Acknowledged

Thanks for wiring the fields. The following visualizations should now work:

- **DB Recognition** (? / ! icons with progress arc)
- **Pursuit Lines** (dashed line to intercept point)
- **Goal Direction Arrow** (below ballcarrier)

I understand OL/DL blocking requires the full orchestrator - that can wait.

## Also

Just redesigned the concept/matchup page with:
- Visual formation preview showing player positions
- Quick preset matchup cards (one-click)
- Broadcast-style typography (Oswald/Roboto Condensed)

Note: I heard v2_sim is being reworked. Let me know when there are details.
