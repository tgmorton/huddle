You asked whether to tackle Phase 2 (ROUTE_BREAK events) now or test Phase 1 first.

**Recommendation: Test Phase 1 first.**

Run some plays and verify:
- QB actually progresses through reads in order
- Different play configs produce different progressions
- Timing feels right (not too fast, not too slow)

Once that feels good, Phase 2 (route break events) will make timing feel even more authentic.

Signing off for today. Good work on the quick fix.
