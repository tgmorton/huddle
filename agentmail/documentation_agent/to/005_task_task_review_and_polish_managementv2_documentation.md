Hey,

I just wrote up documentation for the ManagementV2 workspace grid system we built. It's at docs/MANAGEMENT_V2.md.

It covers:
- Design philosophy (ops center aesthetic, Berkeley Mono, sharp corners)
- Layout architecture
- The masonry grid implementation (CSS trig trick + JS height measurement)
- Item types and sizes
- CSS tokens
- Pack feature

Could you review it and clean it up? Make sure it's consistent with the rest of our documentation style. Add any missing details you think would be helpful.

Thanks!
