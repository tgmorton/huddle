## Gut Reaction

Your instinct is right. **War Room as the core identity** with phase-specific shifts.

But I want to push back on one thing: Broadcast for game day might be wrong. Here is why.

---

## The Core Insight

This game is about **what happens between games**, not the games themselves. The user is a coach, not a broadcaster. Game day should still feel like *your* experience of the game - nervous, invested, unable to control what happens on the field.

**War Room** = planning, control, preparation
**Game Day** = loss of control, watching your work succeed or fail

Broadcast aesthetic says "you are presenting this." But the coach is not presenting - the coach is *suffering through it*.

## My Proposal: War Room + Press Box Hybrid

| Phase | Aesthetic | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Management (Tue-Sat) | **War Room** | You are in control. Planning. Deciding. |
| Game Day (Sunday) | **Press Box** | Elevated but anxious. Watching, not controlling. |
| Draft/FA | **War Room + Editorial** | Big decisions need storytelling context |
| Offseason | **Editorial** | Reflection, narrative, "where are they now" |

**Press Box** is distinct from Broadcast:
- Still dim, focused
- But now you are watching screens showing the action
- Less polish, more tension
- Binoculars-on-the-field energy, not ESPN-studio energy

## Answering Your Specific Questions

### 1. Font System

**Go bolder.** Inter is too neutral for a game this distinctive.

Recommendation:
- **Headers**: Condensed bold sans (like actual NFL playbooks - think Gotham Condensed or similar)
- **Body**: Keep Inter or switch to something with more character
- **Data/Stats**: Tabular figures, monospace for numbers that need to align
- **Narrative text**: Subtle serif for player stories (your Editorial moments)

### 2. Phase Visual Shifts

**Yes, dramatic shifts.** This reinforces the calendar-driven gameplay.

- **Monday**: Recovery amber/warm tones. Healing.
- **Tue-Thu**: Cool blues/grays. Analysis mode.
- **Friday**: Intensity building. Warmer, tighter.
- **Game Day**: High contrast. Blacks and team colors.
- **Offseason**: Softer. More white space. Reflective.

The shift itself is content - it tells you "time has passed, context has changed."

### 3. Visualizing Uncertainty

Dotted borders are weak. Better options:

- **Blur/defocus**: Uncertain information is literally harder to read
- **Handwritten annotations**: "?" marks, crossed-out guesses, question marks
- **Confidence gradients**: Solid → translucent based on certainty
- **Multiple values shown**: "72-78 OVR" instead of picking one number
- **Scout attribution**: "Per Jenkins: B+" makes clear it is opinion not fact

### 4. Player Morale Visualization (Inner Weather)

**Ambient over explicit.** Badges feel like a spreadsheet.

Ideas:
- **Portrait treatment**: Confident players have brighter, sharper photos. Struggling players are slightly desaturated, shadows heavier.
- **Body language in portraits**: Different poses for different states (leaning forward = engaged, arms crossed = frustrated)
- **Environmental tells**: A disgruntled player card might have a slightly crumpled edge, coffee ring, like you have been staring at it worried
- **Animation**: Confident players portraits have subtle movement. Struggling players are static.

The goal: You *feel* something is off before you read the number.

### 5. The One Thing

> "What should someone remember about this UI?"

**It feels like a real place.**

Not a dashboard. Not an app. A place you go to do a job. When you close the game, you should feel like you left the facility.

---

## Events and Objectives Visualization

### Events (Interruptions)

Events should feel like **something landing on your desk**.

- Physical metaphor: A folder, a note, a message slip
- Arrives with slight animation (slides in, drops)
- Cannot be ignored - must acknowledge or dismiss
- Urgent events have visual urgency (red edge, tilted angle, "URGENT" stamp)

### Objectives (Persistent Frame)

Objectives should be **environmental**, not UI chrome.

- A whiteboard in the corner with the current objective written on it
- Changes when objective shifts (you see it being erased and rewritten)
- Subtle but always visible
- "Championship or Bust" scrawled in aggressive marker vs "Evaluate the Youth" in measured handwriting

The objective sets the tone of the room.

## Summary Recommendation

1. **War Room as core** - You are in a place, not using an app
2. **Press Box for game day** - Watching, not presenting
3. **Phase color shifts** - Calendar feels real
4. **Bolder typography** - Match the game ambition
5. **Ambient morale** - Feel it before you read it
6. **Events as physical objects** - Landing on your desk
7. **Objectives as environment** - Written on the wall

The one thing: **It feels like a real place.**
