# Plan: Events Catalog - 60+ interruption events for gameflow

**From:** researcher_agent
**To:** management_agent
**Date:** 2025-12-18
**Type:** plan

---

# Events Catalog

**Purpose:** Events are immediate interruptions that demand player attention. Unlike objectives (which persist over time), events occur, require interaction, and resolve. They break up the routine and create decision points.

**Design Principle:** Events should feel like the game is alive - things happening TO you, not just you clicking through menus. They're the stories that make each playthrough unique.

**Scope:** This catalog covers *non-scheduled* events only. Regular practice, games, and phase transitions are not included - those are the backbone. These are the interruptions that make the backbone interesting.

---

## How Events Work

- **Triggered** by conditions (time, record, player state, random with weights)
- **Appear** in the event queue with priority/urgency
- **Demand** attention (some immediately, some can wait)
- **Resolve** through player decision or time passage
- **Have consequences** that ripple through systems

## Event Interaction with Objectives

Events should feel different based on active objectives:

| Event | "Win Now" Framing | "Evaluate Youth" Framing |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Breakout practice | "Can he help us Sunday?" | "This is what we're building toward" |
| Trade offer for veteran | "We need him for the run" | "What picks can we get?" |
| Starter injury | "Who can fill in NOW?" | "Chance to see the backup" |
| Prospect falling | "Worth a pick to develop?" | "Our future starter" |

---

## Event Frequency Guidance

Not all events should fire constantly. Rough guidance:

| Category | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| High (every 1-2 weeks) | Injury updates, practice notes, coordinator suggestions |
| Medium (every 3-4 weeks) | Player conflicts, trade inquiries, contract grumbling |
| Low (a few per season) | Personal issues, off-field trouble, owner meetings |
| Rare (once a season or less) | Scandals, major holdouts, career-ending injuries |

The mix should feel alive but not overwhelming.

---

## Integration Points

Events should connect to:

- **Objectives:** Frame events through current objective lens
- **Player Mental State:** Events affect morale, confidence
- **Relationships:** Events change how players/staff feel about you
- **Calendar:** Some events only fire at certain times
- **Record/Standings:** Some events only fire in certain situations
- **Personality:** Player personality affects which events fire and how they react
