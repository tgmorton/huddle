# Direction Change: Back to Fundamentals

## Scrapping Current Direction

The UI revamp direction we've been discussing - war room aesthetics, morale portrait treatments, phase theming, textures - is being scrapped.

We got too far ahead of ourselves. Before we add visual polish and metacognitive features, we need to nail the fundamentals.

---

## New Priority: Simple & Clear

The focus now is:

1. **Clear information hierarchy** - Can users find what they need?
2. **Readable layouts** - Does it work at a glance?
3. **Functional basics** - Does the UI actually work well?
4. **Simple interactions** - No clever animations, just clear feedback

---

## What This Means

- No portrait morale treatments (for now)
- No phase color theming (for now)
- No war room textures (for now)
- No handwriting fonts or whiteboard metaphors

Instead: Clean, functional, obvious UI that works.

---

## Why

We were designing solutions for problems we haven't validated yet. Better to ship something simple that works, then add sophistication based on real usage.

The fancy stuff can come later - once the foundation is solid.

---

## Next Steps

I'll focus on making sure the existing screens are clear, functional, and well-organized before adding any new visual concepts.
